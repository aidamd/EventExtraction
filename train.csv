"A Muslim civil rights group is seeking hate crime charges in an alleged attack by a Harford County man on a Muslim teen.

Charles Valle Jr., 60, was charged in the February incident with second-degree assault and malicious destruction of property, both misdemeanors.

The Harford County states attorney said he does not view the incident as a hate crime.

Dawar Aamir, 19, gave his version of the confrontation at a news conference Wednesday.

Aamir said he was driving in Bel Air on Feb. 27 when he was nearly in a collision with a vehicle driven by an older white man.

When Aamir parked his car, he said, he heard a loud bang, and then the man yanked open his door.

Aamir said the man hit him in the face, knocking off his glasses. As Aamir felt around the ground for his glasses, now broken, he said, the man yelled at him to get out of the country.

I wouldnt wish this pain and humiliation on my worst enemies, Aamir said.

Valle could not be reached for comment Wednesday. Messages left for his attorney were not returned.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations called on prosecutors to bring hate crime charges.

The physical, emotional, and psychological toll of such attacks must not be ignored or trivialized, said Zainab Chaudry, outreach director for CAIR Maryland. We urge prosecutors to hold this alleged attacker accountable and to send a message to the public that hate crimes will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

Harford County States Attorney Joseph Cassilly said he didnt think it was necessary to add hate crime charges.

Its a road rage incident where the victim and defendant happen to be of different ethnic backgrounds, he said. Its not like the guy just picked the guy out of a crowd and walked up to him for no reason.

CAIR says it received 851 reports nationwide in the first quarter of this year of incidents that contained an identifiable element of anti-Muslim bias. The organization says alleged bias incidents increased more than 55 percent from 2015 to 2016.

It speaks to the normalization of anti-Muslim bigotry in this country, Chaudry said.

Raees Khan, executive director of the Greater Baltimore Muslim Council, said his community is fearful. A hate crime charge in Aamirs case, he said, would help put people at ease.

CAIR attorney Gadeir Abbas said, Its important for all parts of the government to do what can be done to tamp down this rising tide of bigotry.

It sends a message that this type of bigoted violence is not going to be tolerated in Harford County.",1

"The Justice Department charged James Alex Fields Jr., the driver accused of killing a counterprotester at last year’s white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, with multiple hate crimes Wednesday.

The charges include two hate crimes connected to the death of Heather Heyer, a counterprotester who was run over when Fields allegedly drove his car into a throng of anti-racist marchers. Fields also was indicted on 28 counts of hate crimes “causing bodily injury and involving an attempt to kill.” Those charges are related to the dozens of people injured in the same event.

“At the Department of Justice, we remain resolute that hateful ideologies will not have the last word and that their adherents will not get away with violent crimes against those they target,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. “Last summer’s violence in Charlottesville cut short a promising young life and shocked the nation. Today’s indictment should send a clear message to every would-be criminal in America that we aggressively prosecute violent crimes of hate that threaten the core principles of our nation.”

One of the counts filed in federal court in Charlottesville carries the possibility of the death penalty, although under Justice Department guidelines it will take months for prosecutors to decide whether they would seek execution if Fields, 21, is convicted.

[Read the Fields indictment]

Fields, who has been described by those who know him as a Nazi sympathizer, drove to Charlottesville from Ohio last summer as members of the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazi organizations and far-right white nationalist groups converged on the city. The groups participated in an Aug. 11 torchlight march through the University of Virginia campus and a “Unite the Right” rally the following day.

Both events were marked by racist and homophobic slurs and chants such as “Jews will not replace us” and “Our blood, our soil!” And both events rapidly descended into violence as marchers and counterprotesters clashed on the streets of the typically placid college town.

White supremacist leaders Richard Spencer and Jason Kessler, both University of Virginia graduates, organized the weekend events to protest the decision by Charlottesville to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee from a downtown park and rename the park Emancipation Park and, they said, to protect white heritage and white civil rights.

But the marchers at the Saturday rally, many armed with guns, clubs and bats, met fierce opposition from community members and anti-fascist protesters. Clashes soon erupted at the park and across the city. Law enforcement did not act immediately to break up altercations and stood by while groups battled in front of them. By 11:30 that morning, police declared the rally an unlawful assembly and it was not allowed to go on.

As the marchers and counterprotesters dispersed, there were isolated incidents of violence. But most groups separated, and it seemed that further damage had been averted.

Less than two hours later, though, as counterprotesters carrying signs paraded through downtown streets, Fields approached in his 2010 Dodge Challenger. According to the indictment, Fields observed the crowd and then, “with no vehicle behind him, Fields slowly reversed his vehicle to the top of the hill near the intersection of Fourth and Market streets. Fields then rapidly accelerated, ran through a stop sign and across a raised pedestrian mall, and drove directly into the crowd, striking numerous individuals, killing Heyer and injuring many others.”

Heyer did not go to the event looking for a fight, said Adam S. Lee, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Richmond office. “She was looking to lend her voice to her cause. Peaceful protest without intimidation, without the threat of violence is every American’s birthright,” Lee said at a news conference announcing the indictment

Fields had been photographed during the rally carrying a shield with the insignia of Vanguard America, a white supremacist group that had a large presence at the event. The group later denied that Fields was a member. At the time of his arrest in Charlottesville, he was employed as a security guard.

[A neo-Nazi’s rage-fueled journey to Charlottesville]

Fields once told his former high school teacher, Derek Weimer, that the Army had turned him down because of his psychiatric history. Classmates and former teachers were aware of his infatuation with Hitler. Weimer told The Washington Post that he knew Fields held racist and anti-Semitic beliefs and that he praised Nazi ideology.

On the day of the rally, according to the indictment, “Multiple groups and individuals, including Fields, engaged in chants promoting or expressing white supremacist and other racist and anti-Semitic views.”

The impact of the weekend’s events was magnified when President Trump asserted that both the white supremacists and those who protested against them deserved blame.

Dozens of the white supremacists taking part in the rally wore red Make America Great Again hats and were vocal in their support of Trump. At an afternoon news conference on the day of the riots, Trump condemned “this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides. On many sides.”

David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader and a Trump supporter who was in Charlottesville for the Unite the Right rally, replied to the president, writing, “I would recommend you take a good look in the mirror & remember it was White Americans who put you in the presidency, not radical leftists.”

Later that week, Trump further angered critics when he said that there were “some very fine people” among those who took part in the torchlight procession through the U-Va. campus and the rally.

In addition to the federal charges, Fields is being prosecuted in the city of Charlottesville on numerous state charges, including first-degree murder. That trial is expected to begin Nov. 26 in Charlottesville Circuit Court and is scheduled to last three weeks.

In the state case, Fields also is charged with aggravated malicious wounding counts and could face up to four life sentences plus 110 years in prison.

For the first-degree murder charge, Fields is being represented by Denise Lunsford, a former prosecutor. She declined to comment on the new indictments.

Susan Bro, Heyer’s mother, attended a news conference announcing the charges in Charlottesville. She told reporters she hadn’t yet read the full indictment and she isn’t sure whether she would support the death penalty for Fields. “I’m going to leave that to the process to decide,” she said. “It’s not my place to decide that.”

The decision to charge Fields with hate crimes comes as Charlottesville and other communities are preparing for the anniversary of the deadly riot. Kessler is appealing a decision by the city of Charlottesville to refuse his request to hold an event there on the weekend of Aug. 11-12. He has also received approval from the National Park Service to hold a “white civil rights” rally in Washington across the street from the White House that weekend. In his application for a permit, Kessler said he expects 400 people to attend that event.

Thomas Cullen, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia, said at the news conference Wednesday in Charlottesville that the government is continuing to investigate other aspects of Aug. 12 and that the investigation is a priority in his office and the Civil Rights division.

"GREENDALE -- In 2014, the Milwaukee Common Council voted to approve a new sex offender ordinance, banning them from living within 2,000 feet of schools, parks and day care centers. According to a report by the Journal Sentinel this week, supporters of the ordinance back in 2014 said it would protect the public by pushing more offenders out of the city and into the suburbs, where a disproportionately low number of the countys offenders lived. We wanted to know what this meant for Greendale. Using information compiled by the State Department of Corrections, we were able to create a registered sex offender map for Greendale, showing locations of each offender. In total, Greendale houses 5 such offenders. Here is a list of the general location, crime and conviction date for each offender. 5400 block Meadow Dr.Crime: Child EnticementConviction Date: 06/22/2006 8800 block Greenmeadow Ln.Crime: Third-Degree Sexual AssaultConviction Date: 09/24/2015 5600 block of Azalea Ct.Crime: First-Degree Sexual Assault of a ChildConviction Date: 02/05/1992 5400 block of Rainbow DriveCrime: Use of a Computer to Facilitate a Child Sex CrimeConviction Date: 09/10/2004 5500 block Angle LaneCrime: Repeated Acts of Sexual Assault Against Same ChildConviction Date: 08/24/1999 What the Journal Sentinel had found was that Milwaukee County suburbs continue to house about 10% of county offenders — about the same percentage as before the ordinance. As it turns out, tighter rules in Milwaukee havent produced the mass-exodus into the suburbs as initially thought. Instead, it has given rise to a spike in the homeless sex offender problem - and thats worrisome for public officials.

"Singer-songwriter asks Mayor for help finding driver who called him poofter Related Links Will Young Will Young on Twitter Transport for London Participate Sign up for our Fulham newsletter Comment on this story on the

Transport for London has apologised to singer songwriter and actor Will Young after he reported homophobic abuse by a bus driver in Fulham. Will, 38 said he was driving through Fulham on December 12 when the bus driver called him a poofter. He is now trying to track down the driver to prevent further abuse, and has asked London Mayor Sadiq Khan for help. Will was driving his car at about 12.25pm on 12 December when he became involved in an altercation with the driver of a bus coming towards him on the opposite side of the road. Will, who came out as gay in 2002, tweeted about the incident @willyoung on 5 January, saying: Homophobic abuse from a tfl bus driver calling me a poofter. Reported it ten minutes after it happened and TfL been amazing.



TfL doing everything they can but I am appealing to @TfL @SadiqKhan to help me find the driver to ensure he doesnt abuse others . PLEASE DM me. He added:  TfL been great at reacting to my tweet . All I need is an apology - no witch hunt . To be called a poofter isnt the nicest thing and it reminds me what a vile thing prejudicial language is to try and shame others. I can take action, many young people cant. Steve Burton, TfL’s Director of Enforcement, said: We’re very sorry to hear of Will Youngs experience, and are looking into it urgently. Any form of hate crime is completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated. Everyone has the right to travel without fear of abuse or intimidation and if anyone witnesses or is victim to hate crime they should report it immediately. We work closely with our police partners to eradicate hate crimes and fully investigate all reported incidents.



A spokesman for the Mayor of London said: The Mayors Office are in touch with Will Young in regards to this incident and the work being done across the TfL network to tackle all forms of abuse including homophobic hate crime. January 11, 2018",1

"To better understand the current spike in bigotry and hate in the United States, Yahoo News interviewed historians, sociologists, psychologists and experts who track and study hate groups. And we spoke to four individuals caught up in this movement. From a former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard to a 22-year-old ex-“social justice warrior,” each described a combination of factors that — despite their varying ages and diverse upbringings — led all four of them on the path to white nationalism.

Gunther Rice was born and raised in southern New Jersey but now lives in Indiana, where he is training to be an electrician. Rice, who identifies as belonging to “Generation Z,” says his views are “more radical” than some of the older members of the movement.

Clad in a black bomber jacket over a black shirt printed with the words “Orthodoxy or Death” over the logo of the Union of Orthodox Banner Bearers, a Russian nationalist-fundamentalist group, Rice talked to Yahoo News at a diner in Pulaski, Tenn., the birthplace of the Ku Klux Klan. Rice and other members of the white nationalist Traditionalist Worker Party had stayed in Pulaski following a White Lives Matter rally in Shelbyville, Tenn., earlier this month.

Oh, very much so. They took a survey one time at my high school and there was 50 different languages spoken at home out of 2,000 kids. So for every 40 kids there was a new language spoken at home.

We had Somalis, Pakistanis, Ethiopians, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Guatemalans, El Salvadorans…

Yeah, I mean, any time you get “integration,” quote-unquote, you always get certain cliques that form around where people are going to feel more comfortable.

There was very social-justice-oriented, sponsored days where you could get benefits and stuff for social signaling.

We had “be the change day,” for example. They’d get everyone in a room, basically, and it’s like, “all right, you can get excused from all your classwork for the day, free cookies and pizza, and listen, like, homosexuality and all these races, everyone is the same, everything is great.”

There was an agenda there.

I’d say most of my friends were white but there were definitely a few Asians and a few Puerto Ricans and there were some blacks, yeah, that I was friends with.

If you are a high achiever academically, you’re still gonna generally get in where you want to get in.

I haven’t experienced as much academic discrimination just because I have always been academically excellent. But if you are, say, a white person who’s like in the middle, 3 GPA or something, statistically you will not get chosen over a minority with similar grades, even if they’re slightly below.

My personal case might not be the best example just because I have always been pretty academically excellent.

Your average white person, they’re all going to feel that a heck of a lot.

I am kind of like, I’m not white privileged but I am just, um, quite blessed in a lot of ways.

[Later, he comes back to this.]

Actually, you know what, yeah. There was one job I worked, it was like a cashier and a cart guy at a grocery store. It was when I was in high school and everything, so just minimum wage B.S.

So, the blacks at my work utterly got to slack off all day and it wasn’t hidden, you know what I mean?

Story Continues

Every single white person there would look at each other like — or heck, even the Asian people or the mostly-white Hispanics — we’d all look at each other and be like, “Yep.”

And then we’d get bitched out over just slacking the tiniest bit, just like, “Oh, you weren’t cleaning your register.” And then it’s like … one of the black guys will do something totally unprofessional, totally out of line, that no one else would get away with … it’s just like, “Oh, that’s just him.”

How did you get involved in the white nationalist movement?

I was a social justice warrior.

I was never quite anti-white and … I just realized that it is intrinsically anti-white, whenever you get into any sort of egalitarianism. That’s kind of one of my first red pills.

[The “red pill,” a reference drawn from the movie The Matrix, is a metaphor for awakening from a state of ignorance.]

Give ya an example. There’s a few hundred black people killed by cops every year, right?

Well, have you ever looked up interracial hate-crime statistics? If you look at the proportions of population, massively lopsided against white people.

[In fact, the FBI’s recently released report on hate crime statistics for 2016 found that 50.2 percent of hate crime victims were targeted because of bias against black or African-American people, compared to 20.5 percent of victims who were targeted because of anti-white bias.]

I’d bring this up to, say, a liberal group, and they’re like, “Well, they’ve still got white privilege. Yeah, she got gang-raped and burned to death but, you know, she still had the white privilege.”

And I’m just like, “Oh! So this isn’t really about equal, this is just anti-white. OK.”

Then I looked into that more and, about five years ago, I came across Stormfront.

I was never a part of the alt-right, I was never a libertarian. I think liberty is kind of gay.

So I just came to Stormfront … and I went, “Oh, OK … yeah, my school did teach me that! Yeah, you know what? Ever since I was a kindergartener, they do have an anti-white historical narrative! They leave out a lot of shit, don’t they?”

My mind was blown just by the hypocrisy I had seen.

How old were you at this time?

About 16, 17?

I was always very political and a very big history buff from a young age.

How did you get involved with the Traditionalist Worker Party?

Recently I was kind of introduced to the concept of activism and rallies.

I wasn’t really aware too much that rallies were a thing so I’m like, “Wait, there’s a bunch of white nationalists that go out in public and speak and do all this cool stuff and cool events? Hell yeah.”

So I went to Auburn when Richard Spencer spoke there. I went to Pikeville. I went to the first Charlottesville event, and then I went to the second one as well.

For Mayberry, who describes his small-town Indiana upbringing as “working-class white,” the ideals espoused by the white nationalism movement echoed the same values—“to be proud of my heritage” — that he’d been raised with. Still, it wasn’t until earlier this year that Mayberry began to channel those values into action, by getting involved with his local branch of the Traditionalist Worker Party (TWP).

_____

How did you get involved in this movement?

Really what it was for me was, I kind of let my life slip into just going off base urges and everything like that.

A lot of people in the movement came from past lives where it’s like we’re drug users, we’re just people who never did anything with life, and then we realized we’ve messed up our lives.

Coming to, like, the Traditionalist Worker Party, the League of the South, any of the other groups, the Nationalist Front or others, we’ve managed to get our lives on track. I feel like I actually have something in my life I can say I’m proud of.

How did you get connected with the Traditionalist Worker Party?

Internet culture. I reached out to a couple of other people in the party and then one day I asked about looking into who’s over in my area.

Back in January, I seen a video of [TWP founder Matthew] Heimbach debating with two leftists at Inauguration Day and I was like, “I don’t know anything about this group, but I know I gotta find out more of it. I don’t know if I’m even gonna join or not but these people seem awesome!”

What do you do for work?

I work eight hours a day at a factory.

I’ve always been working factory jobs and everything like that, because I started working in factories as soon as I graduated high school.

Actually, it’s one of the reasons I was able to learn up so much on the party. I had actually lost my job back in January and I was out of a job from January into July.

Up where I’m at, you get hired on at the factories and they either get the people they need and don’t need anybody else, or you just don’t get called back. So I was lucky that when July came around … they put me through because they needed the manpower.

I’ve always been working class white. At the same time it was like, “I’ve gotta have a job, otherwise I can’t do anything to help the party, help myself.”

So now you feel a sense of purpose?

Oh, yeah. Nobody wants to just set at home and do nothing. It’s not a fun feeling, you just waste away.

If you’re not working to something, what are you really doing?

What is your role in the TWP?

I help coordinate things in my area, down in southern Indiana. We’re still growing our numbers there as well so, I mean, it’s more or less whatever role I need to fill at the time.

How much of your time is spent on TWP activity?

I’m either away on party business every weekend or every other weekend anymore, it seems. And I have no problem with it whatsoever.

Do you agree with the idea [argued by Gunther Rice] that a white person has less chance to be hired or accepted to college if they’re competing against a nonwhite person with the same or lesser qualifications?

Oh yeah. I mean, I didn’t go to university, so there were a couple times where I know that if I apply for a job and if I get a black dude and a Mexican applying with me, they’re gonna be like, “Well, we’ve got a diversity quota and your credentials aren’t standing out enough.”

Have you had that happen to you?

No. But I said, I work factory jobs so it’s like, they go by if you can do the job.

What does your family think about your involvement in this movement?

My family actually raised me to be proud of my heritage, to be proud of who I am … so these ideals aren’t new to me.

But even still, my mother tells me every day, “I love and support you, you’re my only son, but I don’t agree with everything you’re doing.”

That’s fine, I don’t want them to be involved in it. If anything I do comes back to them, yes I’m going to feel awful but at the same time I stand by my convictions.

My family still loves and supports me. We’re an old Irish style family, you mess with one Mayberry, you mess with all of them.

John May, 30.

Though he’s lived in east Tennessee for the past 10 years, John May’s white nationalist views are rooted in negative experiences he says he had growing up in demographically diverse Houston, Texas.

Covered in tattoos, including a Celtic knot on his neck and a small swastika on his hand, May is upset about what he believes is unfair media coverage of events like the deadly clashes between members of the alt-right and counterprotesters in Charlottesville this summer, and the September shooting by a Sudanese immigrant that killed one and injured several others at a church in Antioch, Tenn.

May spoke to Yahoo News at a White Lives Matter rally in Shelbyville, Tenn., earlier this month, where he said he hoped to draw more attention to the Antioch shooting as well as the recent influx of immigrants to middle Tennessee in general. He was accompanied by another rallygoer who, he said, he’d met in person for the first time in Charlottesville. Before that, the two had only met each other online.

_____

Do you mostly meet other people within this movement online?

A lot of our networking is done online, but I’ve met a lot of people through real life. The internet is pretty much the best route these days to find like-minded people.

How long have you been involved in the white nationalist movement?

I’ve been involved in identity politics for about 12 years.

I started out as a leftist. I was an anarchist and went into left-wing politics and socialism and stuff and realized, growing up in Houston, that the thing is, it devolved into identity politics.

You can’t just be a leftist and be for your people at the same time. Leftist politics are literally just multiculturalism and globalism. They think they’re fighting the system but they’re really just playing into the system

How did you make the switch?

I just read a lot and, like I said, just being a white man growing up in an area where you were pretty much attacked for being white, [I] have to come to the understanding that you have to stick with your own people.

To a certain degree, everybody does. Blacks do it, Latinos do it, American Indians do it. And it’s celebrated and that should be celebrated. Blacks and Latinos and everybody should be doing stuff for their people, we’re not disagreeing with that at all. It’s just white people should be allowed that same right.

Anybody else, like blacks and Latinos and everything, they can do that and not be labeled racist, but any time a white man stands up for his own people they automatically label him a Nazi or racist or hater.

What is the goal of your involvement in identity politics? What would you like to see happen?

I would like to see the creation of an ethnostate, although in reality that is kind of far-fetched. In my lifetime it probably won’t happen.

My family has been here since Jamestown. My family is native to here, essentially, and we just want white people to be able to stand up for white people and not be labeled haters or racists. We want a fair shake as everybody else gets a fair shake.

Is your family still in Houston?

They’re in Tennessee now. I have family that still lives in Houston, but my immediate family is in [Tennessee].

I’ve lost a lot of family members over my beliefs.

My cousins adopted Guatemalan kids, and I loved them as they were my cousins, I never had any issues with them.

But there’s so much hype, people get so brainwashed. Anybody who’s identitarian automatically gets labeled a racist or a Nazi so then … my cousins got in their head like, “Oh, he hates my kids.” And I’m like, “I don’t hate your kids at all.”

I’ve lost a lot of family members over my beliefs.

What’s your social network or internet forum of choice?

It was Facebook and then I’m kicked off of there.

Why?

For being identitarian. We can’t even have Paypals anymore. They’re blocking us out of everything, simply because of our beliefs. Paypal, Twitter, Facebook. … They’ve kicked us off of all forms of crowdsourcing.

We’re just wanting to preserve what America was and should always be, and that’s a place for everybody, essentially.

I don’t care if blacks live in America or Latinos live in America. I don’t want Mexicans necessarily moving into Tennessee because they’re not native to this area at all. If they want to stay in the Southwest, I don’t have a problem with that.

They [the media] are just taking us and they’re putting us into this narrative onto what we believe and the narrative is really not the predominant ideas that identitarians hold on to, you know, hating other people.

I don’t hate anybody. I’m a Christian, you know.

Don Black, 64.

As a former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard and the founder of Stormfront.org, the first major online forum for white nationalists, Don Black represents the older generation of a movement that has become increasingly young and internet-based.

Over the past five decades, Black’s controversial views have gotten him into legal trouble, created professional barriers, and alienated members of his family — most notably his son, Derek, who renounced white nationalism in 2013. Still, every time he’s considered giving it all up, Black finds himself coming back to the conclusion that “It’s the right thing to do. We’re right.”

Black offers unique insight on how the movement has — and hasn’t — changed since he first got involved in the 1960s, and where he sees it going next.

You grew up in Alabama, right?

I was born in north Alabama, near Huntsville, in Athens, Ala. After going to the University of Alabama, I moved to Birmingham. And I moved here, in West Palm Beach [Florida, where he currently lives] back in late ‘87.

What were your interactions with nonwhite people growing up?

In the town I grew up in, there wasn’t much racial tension. There was in Birmingham. I remember my daddy telling me we couldn’t go to the state fair this year “because the Negroes were causing trouble down there.”

My high school initially was all segregated, all the schools I went to, up until maybe junior high, was completely segregated. Then [former Alabama Governor] George Wallace introduced freedom of choice, so blacks that wanted to come to our high school could do so and the ones that wanted to stay in the all-black high school could do so.

So I never really saw full-scale integration of high school. The blacks that came to our high school were the ones that wanted to go to the white school and they didn’t cause trouble. We didn’t have trouble until the full-scale integration, which happened when I was a senior in high school.

[During the summer of 1970, before his senior year, Black was working on the gubernatorial campaign of segregationist and white supremacist J.B. Stoner when he was shot in the chest by a fellow Stoner campaign worker, Jerry Ray. Ray, the brother of James Earl Ray, who assassinated Martin Luther King Jr., was ultimately acquitted of shooting the teenaged Black, who he’d caught trying to steal membership records of Stoner’s National States Rights Party.]

I nearly died. My 17th birthday was three days into the hospital and my birthday present was getting taken off the critical list.

Anyway, I didn’t want to get into a big conflagration at my newly integrated high school, so I went to Huntsville, Ala., to Madison Academy, and that was pleasant. It was all white at the time. Not now, of course, but it was then.

Before you left your old high school, when it was partially segregated, did you have classes with any of the black students?

Yeah, we had black students, but they were all nicely behaved because they were the type that wanted a better education by going to the white school.

That was my high school experience. Of course, the University of Alabama had a contingent of blacks who were very — always tried to cause trouble with me. Just stuff like slamming the door in my face, stuff like that. They never actually challenged me to a fight or anything.

I had experiences with diversity in ensuing years. But initially, [his interest in white nationalism] was purely ideological. I started out as an anticommunist and was concerned about what I was seeing [in Alabama], even though I didn’t experience a lot of it directly.

In my little town … actually, everybody pretty much got along. I think we had maybe 10 or 15 percent black and, you know, they were, as my mother would call them and as all Southern mothers would call them, “the po’ old Negro that lived down the street,” that you felt sorry for, ’cause they worked hard and they didn’t have much and they didn’t cause any trouble. That was the Southern attitude.

Was that your attitude?

Pretty much, as far as where I lived. The neighborhoods were safe. When I was a little kid I could bicycle around town without having to worry. Could walk to school. There was never much crime. We literally were those people that didn’t have to lock their doors when they left home.

So your experiences with the black people in your neighborhood were never negative — you were just troubled by what you saw on the news happening other places?

Right, stuff like that. Of course, not being able to go to the state fair in Birmingham, stuff like that.

How old were you when you couldn’t go to the state fair?

10 or 11, and after that.

There was a lot of trouble in Birmingham. I would later live in Birmingham, but we didn’t go down there except for that annual state fair, which I really appreciated when I was a kid.

[The spring of 1963, when Black was 10 years old, saw the launch of the Birmingham Campaign, during which civil rights activists faced fire hoses and police attack dogs in response to peaceful protests against the city’s segregation laws with marches, lunch counter sit-ins, and boycotts.]

How did you first get your start in the white nationalist movement?

Many years before the internet, of course, back in the day, in 1969 when I was 15 years old, you actually had to find a mailing address and write. You know, the old-fashioned way. And a couple of weeks later they’d send you back a packet of literature.

Who did you write to?

There was the National Youth Alliance, that was actually the first. But Drew Pearson, who those of us my age would remember, he was a self-described columnist, muckraker. He wrote a series of articles about this sinister neo-Nazi movement which was thriving in the U.S. and they had influence in Congress and [prominent white supremacist and Holocaust denier] Willis Carto was the head of it. That piqued my interest.

[An example of Pearson’s reporting is here.]

I wrote the National Youth Alliance [a right-wing political organization also founded by Carto]. I found their address, they were in Washington, D.C., in Dupont Circle. I’d later visit them. I wrote to everybody, pretty much. I wrote to the National Socialist White People’s Party [previously known as the American Nazi Party], in Arlington, Va. I wrote to all kinds of people.

What about these groups sparked your interest? Were your parents proponents of these sorts of political views?

Not exactly. My parents were Southern conservative and I had become, by 14, anticommunist. I knew about groups like Liberty Lobby and the John Birch Society and the George Wallace for president campaign in 1968. I participated in that kind of peripherally, handing out bumper stickers in my hometown, stuff like that.

But I wasn’t completely convinced until I started writing to some of these groups. … I got the full story.

I grew up, of course, in Alabama and I thought the civil rights or so-called civil rights movement was tearing down the country and my state, so that motivated me to look further. By the time I was 15 I was looking further, and so I was interested in these other groups and what they had to say.

William Pierce [a physicist turned prominent white supremacist activist and author] impressed me because, for the previous few years, I had wanted to be a nuclear physicist and Pierce of course had been one of some accomplishment. He probably influenced me more than anybody.

[Black continued to pursue this path as he went to college, attempting to start a white student union at the University of Alabama, but failing to get a faculty adviser to sponsor him. His controversial activities earned him coverage in the campus newspaper, which, he said, impeded his progress in the military.]

I was in the basic ROTC program, and when I started making the campus newspaper, on the front of the campus newspaper, ROTC wanted to kick me out, even though they thought I was a good cadet. The professor of military science would even say that later I was a poster boy for them, but unfortunately I had all of these liabilities.

Later on I did enlist in the Army reserve.

When did you get involved in the Ku Klux Klan?

In ’75 I joined David Duke’s [Knights of the Ku Klux] Klan. I’d been reading about him, but I already knew him for years.

There’s actually a New York Times article about a rally that he held outside of Baton Rouge with, I think they said 2,700 people, which was huge by our standards, to actually get that many people to an indoor rally. So that piqued my interest, David’s accomplishing something.

[In fact, the 1975 Times article Black seems to be referencing states that, according to the FBI, Klan membership had dwindled from 17,000 in 1976 to only 1,700 across 15 Klan groups nationwide. Duke, then 24-year-old Grand Dragon of the Louisiana-based Knights of the KKK, reportedly disputed the FBI’s statistics, telling the Times, “We had almost 3,000 people at our rally in Walker, and most of them were members.”]

What was your impression of the Klan when you were younger, growing up in Alabama? Did you ever think you’d become a part of it?

No. We had a Klan Klavern in Athens that I had heard about, but I hadn’t considered joining because they just didn’t seem to have the intellectual wherewithal. I didn’t consider joining the Klan until I heard about David.

What was it about David Duke that appealed to you?

I knew David, I knew that he understood everything, and the fact that he was getting so many people at his rallies was impressive. So that’s the reason I went down and joined up with a couple of other friends, three other friends from Alabama, one of whom would become my wife later. And then ex-wife.

[Black’s current wife, Chloe, was previously married to Duke. ]

What did your parents think about you joining the Klan?

They weren’t hostile. They had met David too, and they weren’t hostile but they thought it was a really bad idea for me to be getting all this attention. They thought it was dangerous.

They were never completely happy about it. My father was a little more accepting. They came over to our side, or my side, intellectually after a while. But they thought that it was, particularly my mother thought that it was dangerous in various ways, so she was never happy about that.

What about your siblings?

I have a big sister, 12 years older than me. She’s not exactly on our side but she’s … a Trump supporter.

[Over the next 12 years, Black gained prominence as a leader of the Alabama chapter of Duke’s Klan. In 1981, he and several other white supremacists were arrested by federal agents before embarking on a plot to invade the Caribbean island of Dominica by boat and violently overthrow its black-run government. Black spent three years in federal prison, where he learned the computer programming skills that would later help him create Stormfront.]

[Though he finally left the Klan in 1987, Black continued to work on Duke’s perennial political campaigns, even after relocating to West Palm Beach, Fla.]

I’ve lived here as long as I’ve lived anywhere, but I never intended to stay here.

I was going to stay here about five years and make my fortune and then move back to Alabama. But I didn’t make my fortune and so I’m still here. I’ve kind of given up on the fortune, actually.

[Black explains that he’d hoped to become a stock broker but failed to obtain his brokerage license, a decision he says was made by Florida’s “Jewish comptroller” based solely on his reputation and affiliation with David Duke. In lieu of work, Black says, “I devoted myself full-time to political activity.”]

I actually started Stormfront as a dial-up bulletin board shortly thereafter, in 1990. During one of the David Duke campaigns, the follow-up campaign when he was running for U.S. Senate, as a very small bulletin board.

What were your initial traffic numbers?

About 500 a day. Back then it was [pretty good]. And that was without any kind of advertising, or not much. That was just from search engines.

What’s your membership now?

We get about 50,000 user sessions a day and there are over 300,000 registrations, most of which are not active, of course, but we have accumulated that many. So it’s still fairly active.

Of course, we were down for a month after Network Solutions [Stormfront’s domain registrar] decided that we were in violation of their terms of service for having the wrong political views. This was in the aftermath of Charlottesville.

I was finally able to wrestle it back from them but they had frozen it, they had locked it, I couldn’t get it back, couldn’t get the domain back initially. We’re kind of back to where we were, but not quite. We’re actually nowhere near back to where we were right after Charlottesville. We had a big spike — our traffic doubled after that.

Stormfront really popularized the term “white nationalism.” What does white nationalism mean to you?

It means racial, white racial nationalism, as opposed to civil nationalism such as what is promoted by Donald Trump and other groups. They disavow any kind of racial aspects to nationalism, but nationalism has traditionally been a racial movement.

Nationalism is not about diversity. It has racial underpinnings and we understand that and we think we have the right to maintain that, at least some portion of this country, as a white nation with a government that reflects the values of our race. Of course, other races feel they have that right, and they don’t come under all of the criticism that we do.

I’m very happy that after we used that term for so many years, whereas the mainstream media would always call us “white supremacists,” now suddenly “white nationalist” is almost as popular as “white supremacist.” I guess we can thank Hillary Clinton for that, back during the campaign.

For whatever reason, at least we’ve made a step upward. White nationalism is much more descriptive than white supremacist. Most people I know don’t consider themselves supremacists. Separatist, maybe, and nationalist.

What do you think about the term “alt-right”? Do you think it applies to you?

That’s a term popularized by Richard Spencer, whom I also know. He didn’t invent it, but he popularized it.

We’ve never used that term, although we’ll accept it. We’ll take it now.

Alt-right was considered a little too [inclusive ] a couple years ago. They had gay speakers. Richard Spencer had this guy [Jack] Donovan who’s openly gay, brags about it, which is just a little too inclusive for most of our people.

That’s kind of what we associated it with. It was not as hardcore ideologically. But now that it’s become popularized, we’ll take it, but we don’t use it very much.

It does take the edge off the racial terms, whether it’s “white supremacist” or “white nationalist.” Just the term “white” has become a term of derision nowadays. You can’t even use the term “white” without offending people. So alt-right, I guess, does have an advantage there. But it’s kind of ill-defined.

What do you think of the new generation of white nationalists, and the state of the movement in general right now?

I think we’re definitely making progress, and the alt-right, whatever it is, is part of that.

Does this stand out as a significant moment for white nationalism?

I think there are more people now involved than ever before. I don’t know about the ‘60s, back when I was just getting started. There were some fairly big meetings back then with other groups, like the National States Rights party and the Klan.

All of that went into rapid decline and by 1970 I thought we’d really hit the pits. I didn’t think it could get any worse, but it did.

Today it’s different. There are quite a few people … in Charlottesville, there were a lot of people there. More so than I think was reported.

Were you in Charlottesville?

No. I’m glad I wasn’t there too. I’m a little bit disabled now. I had a stroke 9 years ago, so I wouldn’t be much good in a fight.

Trump was absolutely right when —he was absolutely wrong because our people weren’t there to start a fight—but he was right when he said that the other side had people there that were violent. They were.

But even then, it’s a pretty big turnout. So we’re seeing more and more of that, and I think we’ll continue to see that.

What do you think is the reason for this recent resurgence?

Zeitgeist. It’s a sign of the times, the spirit of the age.

Of course, immigration motivates a lot of people. And of course Trump has inspired a lot of people.

What’s next for the white nationalist movement?

We want to go beyond Trump. Trump has been a disappointment for a lot of our people. He is, at least, raising awareness about immigration, to a degree. Even though it’s kind of a civic nationalist awareness of immigration. He thinks that it’s OK to bring in third world immigrants as long as they’re properly vetted. But he does want to end the diversity lottery, so he does give us a little bit of hope.

He has divided the country, which might be good.

We have never had a more racially polarized country than we do now. I mean, we have antifa [i.e., far-left-leaning militant groups] smashing things and beating up Trump supporters, and Trump supporters stockpiling guns. So I’m not sure who’s going to win.

Does that concern you?

I don’t want to be in the middle of it, that’s for sure. And I don’t want our family to be in the middle of it.

What would be the ideal outcome of all this?

I think separation will solve the problem. I don’t know exactly how that’s going to turn out, but as I said earlier, I think we have the right to have at least some part of the country that represents our people, our values. A government representing our agenda.

I think that will happen by, for lack of a better word, balkanization. I think our people are voting with their feet. They are moving to other parts of the country even though there’s not really a place to run right now, but there are some places. We’re not going to stay in south Florida much longer.

Where are you going to go?

East Tennessee. We already have family who’ve moved there and we’ve been holding our conferences there for seven years. We’ve had other people move there as well, so it’s one area.

There’s Harrison, Ark. We visited there recently, and we have friends who have lived there a long time. Similar type place, along with Branson, which is nearby.

The ethnostate, which is the term the alt-right likes to use now, and it’s legitimate, is the ultimate goal. I don’t know just how this is going to play out. It’s not going to come immediately, but I think it can come.

Do you think you’ll live to see the creation of an ethnostate?

Will I live to see it? Who knows. I don’t know how long I’m going to live. But I think it will likely happen.

COLLEGE PARK, Md. – Sunday, police identified University of Maryland murder victim as 23-year-old Richard Collins III.

Friends of the victim told DCW50 that the Bowie State student was scheduled to graduate Tuesday, and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Army last Thursday.

Police say Collins was murdered while waiting for an Uber at University of Maryland College Park.

The suspect, UMD student Sean Urbanski, is charged with first and second degree murder.

Police say seconds before the murder, witnesses saw Urbanski yelling and screaming as he approached Collins.

“And then he said to the victim, step left, step left if you know what is good for you, the victim looked at him puzzled and said no. It was then that Sean Urbanski stabbed the victim in his chest,” explained UMD Chief of Police David Mitchell.

Investigators say Urbanski is a member of an anti-Semitic Facebook group, so the FBI is stepping in to investigate this murder as a possible hate crime.",1
"MIDTOWN MANHATTAN, NY — Diamonds arent the only expensive commodity being sold on West 47th Street. Fifty-five kilograms of cocaine, worth $2 million, was seized from a phony Diamond District jewelry business which turned out to be a front for a narcotics smuggling ring, the Special Narcotics Prosecutor for the City of New York announced Friday. Agents from the New York Drug Enforcement Task Force raided 21 Divine, located on West 48th street near Sixth Avenue, on Thursday after staking the business out and witnessing an alleged drug drop, prosecutors told Patch. One man, 26-year-old Junior Lopez-Pena, was arrested leaving the building after the drug drop and has been charged with criminal drug possession, prosecutors said. This brazen trafficking scheme involved the delivery of 55 kilograms of cocaine to a bustling commercial center in Midtown Manhattan during broad daylight. By disrupting the supply chain and seizing $2 million in narcotics we undoubtedly saved lives, Special Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget G. Brennan said in a statement. The state task force and the Los Angeles field division of the Drug Enforcement Administration set their trap in place on Wednesday after identifying three suspicious packages being sent to 21 Divine from a known Los Angeles-based drug front, another fake jewelry business called Sapphire, prosecutors said. After Lopez-Pena was taken into custody, state task force agents searched 21 Divines premises and recovered the 55 kilograms (121 pounds) of cocaine, prosecutors told Patch. An automatic money counter was also seized from the fake jewelry store, prosecutors said. DEA Special Agent James J. Hunt stated that the coast-to-coast drug operation is a sign that Mexican drug cartels may be trying to proliferate the streets of New York City with cocaine. Detectives from the NYPD also assisted the state and federal agents in the investigation, NYPD Commissioner James ONeill said. Despite deliberate efforts to conceal a coast-to-coast drug operation through a phony business front, these alleged drug dealers were taken down through the relentless investigative efforts of NYPD detectives and our federal partners in the joint Drug Enforcement Task Force, ONeill said in a statement.

"WORCESTER, MA—A Worcester man was indicted on Thursday in federal court in Worcester on a federal firearms charge. Steven Rivera, 24, was charged with being a felon in possession of ammunition. Rivera was arrested on June 29, 2017, as part of a coordinated federal and state sweep that resulted in the arrests of eight others who have been charged with firearms-related offenses, said the U.S. Attorney-District of Massachusetts. The DA said that according to court documents, Rivera – who has multiple prior felony convictions, including drug-related offenses – sold two handguns and numerous rounds of ammunition to a person in Worcester on Feb. 14, 2017. On Feb. 28, 2017, Rivera sold that same recipient two more handguns and numerous rounds of ammunition, and during a recorded phone call, Rivera offered to sell that person heroin, as well. Eight others were arrested on state charges as part of an investigation into gun and narcotics trafficking in the Worcester area. During the course of the investigation, law enforcement purchased nine guns from nine defendants, including several handguns, two shotguns, and an assault rifle with a 100-round capacity drum magazine; multiple rounds of ammunition; and narcotics. Law enforcement seized several more guns during the June 29, 2017, sweep. Photo via Shutterstock",0
"BOSTON, April 23 (Reuters) - Hate crimes targeting U.S. Muslims rose 15 percent in 2017, the second year of increases, according to a study released on Monday by advocacy group the Council on American-Islamic Relations.

The group recorded 300 U.S. hate crimes targeting Muslims last year, ranging from the June beating of a Muslim man in the Bronx borough of New York City by attackers who called him a terrorist to a November incident when a Muslim familys Kansas restaurant was burned down. That was up from 260 in 2016.

CAIR attributed the increase in part to the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump, particularly restrictions on immigration from Muslim-majority countries.

There has been nothing like this ever, for the Muslim community to be regularly the punching bag of the president of the United States, said Gadeir Abbas, an attorney with CAIR.

Responding by email to a request for comment, White House spokeswoman Kelly Love said, The Trump Administration stands for the rule of law and abhors all forms of lawlessness including hate crimes.

President Trump has repeatedly condemned violence, racism and hate groups.

As a candidate, Trump promised a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. Soon after taking office he signed an executive order banning most travelers from several Muslim-majority countries. A revised version of that order, which also included North Korea, took effect late last year.

Trump drew criticism in November for retweeting anti-Muslim videos posted by a far-right British political group.

The 300 hate crimes were a slice of the 2,599 incidents CAIR logged as representing anti-Muslim bias in 2017, a figure that was up 17 percent from 2016. The larger total included harassment, employment discrimination and times when Muslims were subjected to what CAIR recorded as biased treatment by government agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Customs and Border Protection.

More than one-third of the incidents involved federal agencies, CAIR said, adding, This represents an almost unprecedented level of government hostility toward a religious minority within the United States.

CAIR said its lawyers investigated 5,650 reported anti-Muslim incidents and concluded that slightly less than half of them were authentic.

The groups count of hate crimes targeting Muslims is lower than the FBIs, which recorded 307 anti-Islamic hate crimes in 2016, the most recent year for which it has released data.

Last years report measured a 44 percent increase in hate crimes into 2016 from 2015. (Reporting by Scott Malone)

"ARNOLD, MO — Scott Heatherly, 52, has been charged with assault after police say he followed a woman into a Walgreens parking lot and tackled her. The woman, who has not been identified, told police Heatherly followed her in his truck, flashing his lights, until she pulled off the road. He then confronted her, accusing her of throwing something out of her window that hit his truck. The woman came away from the encounter with minor injuries and a broken cellphone.

"A report from the Anti-Defamation League shows that in the first three months of last year, there were 281 incidents of anti-Semitic attacks and threats. Thats nearly doubled this year to 541 incidents. (SBG)

EUGENE, Ore. - Anti-Semitic graffiti has been reported several times over the past few months in the Whiteaker neighborhood.

Mayor Lucy Vinis says thats the exact kind of thing that city is trying to put a stop to.

This should be a community where everyone feels safe, where hate crimes are not acceptable, she said.

Resolution 5190 urges the citys human rights office and police to be proactive in making all Eugene neighborhoods safe.

The City Council meets Monday at 7:30 p.m. The resolution is on the agenda.

There have to be people kind of watching out for it, Steve Lafreniere of Eugene said. The police should be ready that if calls are made, they should be ready to get over there right away, almost as if someones being mugged.

The resolution comes in light of a national increase in anti-Semitic crimes.

A report from the Anti-Defamation League shows that in the first three months of last year, there were 281 incidents of anti-Semitic attacks and threats.

Thats nearly doubled this year to 541 incidents.

This past February, anti-Semitic vandalism plagued the Whiteaker community.

Vinis says it may be a growing trend, but its not new.



There has always been a sector of the community that is very anti-Semitic, Vinis said, and this year is not the first time that weve experienced this.

Vinis said shaping national sentiment starts at a city level.

Cities really drive that conversation, the mayor said, and I think that you would find all across the nation that citys are stepping up to make sure that their residents feel safe. Its critically important.

The mayor said a city resolution might not rid the world of hate, but its a step in the right direction.

Over time, of course, we hope that we change peoples views and that they dont have those hateful views, she said, but short of that, we can contain their capacity to act on hateful views.",1
"MURFREESBORO, Tenn. -- A 24-year-old is accused of a hate crime in Murfreesboro on Tuesday after severely beating man who propositioned him.

According to Murfreesboro Police, the victim says he propositioned 24-year-old Brandon Wiley, who then assaulted him. Police say the victim was beaten to the point where he suffered a broken nose and fractures to both orbital sockets.

Wiley admitted to striking the victim to police and investigators say Wiley had sent out several photos of himself covered in blood and bragging about beating up a gay man for grabbing his crotch.

"While the doors havent even opened to the public yet, someone managed to break into the Wyandotte Jaycees haunted house on Tuesday night, getting away with about $9,000 of tools. The tools belonged to Jaycees members who donate their time and equipment to turn a city building into a frightful attraction each year. This is not stealing from the Jaycees as an organization, this is stealing from all the hardworking men and women that come here and volunteer their time, Jaycees member Nadia Brunt told WJBK-TV. The thief kicked in the front door of the haunted house to gain entry, as well as smashed the windows of an adjacent storage warehouse. Tools, wiring and other items were reported stolen. Jaycees volunteer Ryan Cunningham posted a message on Facebook to the thief. We have been working diligently for over a month to provide a form of entertainment to the community, he wrote. You in no way will stop us, but you have made it harder to deliver the service we provide every year. The only hope I have is that karma catches up with you. Despite the setback, volunteers said they remain dedicated to opening the haunted house, 1096 Biddle, as planned on Oct. 4. Money raised from the event goes back into the Jaycees many community service projects. The haunted house, named Nightmare Sanctum, will be open Oct. 4-7, 11-14, 18-21 and 25-30. Hours are from 7 to 10 p.m., except for Fridays and Saturdays, which go through midnight. The cost is $12 per person. Cash and credit are accepted. The Jaycees partner with the city of Wyandotte on its haunted house. The city provides the Jaycees with a building thats set to be demolished. The Jaycees come in, transform the building into a haunted house during October, and return the building to the city afterward. This years haunted house is in the building that formerly housed Fronczaks Garage.

"Community leaders, including the state head of the NAACP, met with Hartford prosecutors Tuesday to discuss a racially charged case involving a former University of Hartford student and were told that any decisions on adding a hate crime charge will be guided by the evidence and the law.

“They brought to our attention their desire for the addition of a hate crime in this particular instance,” said Assistant State’s Attorney Carl Ajello, who met with the leaders along with Hartford State’s Attorney Gail Hardy. “One of their concerns was it was a long road to get a hate crime statute implemented in the state of Connecticut and they want it to be used when applicable.”

Ajello said prosecutors do not comment on pending charges, but said, “In the end, we have to follow what the evidence uncovers and institute the appropriate charges.”

The case involves Brianna Rae Brochu, 18, a former University of Hartford student who is white, who admitted that she covertly harassed her black roommate and tampered with her belongings and later bragged about it on social media.

West Hartford police charged Brochu last week with breach of peace and criminal mischief. She was was also banned from the university. After Brochu’s arrest, police said they would ask prosecutors to add a felony charge of second-degree intimidation based on bigotry.

Scot Esdaile, president of the Connecticut chapter of the NAACP, said the community leaders were “asking why she has not been charged with a hate crime. From what we’re looking at this is a clear cut hate crime, so tell us why?”

Esdaile added, “We are very disappointed that hate crime charges have not been made … but we are not trying to make something out of nothing.”

Rep. Brandon L. McGee Jr., D-Windsor, who along with Sen. Doug McCrory, D-Hartford, and Hartford City Council President Thomas “TJ” Clarke II attended the meeting and said it was “a lengthy conversation, talking about everything. Because none of us are attorneys, we had to get some clarity on some things … We just want to make sure that justice is served.”

Ajello said Tuesday that prosecutors have not received any requests for new charges from West Hartford, but that they are planning to meet with the police regarding the case.

He also said prosecutors are planning to speak with the victim, Chennel “Jazzy” Rowe, about the case and will consider information she provides when making a decision about additional charges.

Esdaile said the NAACP will hold a news conference and rally at the West Hartford Police Department on Wednesday at 6 p.m. instead of a march from the University of Hartford campus.

“We made it clear that we will do everything in our power outside and in the public to put pressure on making sure that this young white woman is charged with a hate crime.”

Esdaile said “the broader issue is that our community is over-policed and over charged and the white community is under-policed and under-charged.”",1
"The nations largest Muslim civil rights organization is urging communities across the nation to take extra security precautions during Ramadan this year.

According to CAIR, there was a 17 percent increase in bias-motivated incidents against American Muslims and a 15 percent increase in the number of anti-Muslim hate crimes from 2016 to 2017.

The findings appear to be consistent with an analysis released by the Southern Poverty Law Center that found hate crimes increased in 2016. The groups annual census results showed that the number of anti-Muslim hate groups in the country had also increased over the past year.

The FBI found that hate crimes increased more than 5 percent from 2015 to 2016, and nearly tripled the day after Trump was elected.

"Police searched the Hillside Avenue area of Florham Park today looking for a man who allegedly got into an unlocked car that did not belong to him.

"The long, sordid tale of a trio of SUNY-Albany hate crime hoaxers is officially over.

Asha Burwell and Ariel Agudio, two of three students who had refused to agree to any type of plea deal in the matter, were sentenced by Judge Roger McDonough to probation yesterday as “he saw no benefit in incarcerating them.”

Burwell and Aguido managed to avoid assault and harassment charges back in April. The third hoaxer, Alexis Briggs, had confessed to the trio made up the whole story about being racially harassed and then attacked by a group of whites on a bus back in January 2016.

According to WMAC, Judge McDonough likened the students’ story to “The Boy Who Cried Wolf,” noting it “as an example of how the women’s actions had affected the university and the community at large.”

Burwell and Aguido received three years worth of probation, were fined $1000, and ordered to perform 200 hours of community service.

Even at this conclusion, the women’s supporters continued to play up the race angle:

Agudio’s attorney Mark Mishler also headed to the clerk’s office, not before commenting on McDonough’s invoking “The Boy Who Cried Wolf.” “I do think victims of racial bias will be harmed by what happened in court, but not for the reasons that the judge has indicated. They will be harmed because, as we have indicated all along, people will become hesitant to call for help or seek assistance or to ask their community for assistance if they know that if they possibly are perceived to get even one detail wrong, that they will be villified [sic], prosecuted, and face possibility, which was averted today and we’re grateful for that, of jail. So we’re very concerned about that. Racial bias at the University at Albany, it’s real, I don’t think there is a student, a black student or a student of color who can tell you otherwise.” Carlton Agudio, a man who had been in the courtroom gallery with the families of the women directed a rhetorical question to reporters. “Do you for one second think we would be here right now if there were three white girls on that bus were in a fight with a busload of black people?”

Such comments are in line with the philosophy of “Indefensible,” which was created to support the women.

According to its Facebook page, “Indefensible”

[…] attempts to highlight the inherent problems in allowing the benefactors of racism to define and legitimize what constitutes a racially motivated act. Indefensible also looks at the intersections of oppression causing Black women in particular to be regarded as untrustworthy and undeserving of defense.

"ORANGE COUNTY, CA — A 46-year-old man with a lengthy criminal history for thefts faces charges of stealing expensive wine -- including a bottle worth $30,000 -- from a market in Santa Ana, police said Wednesday. Robert Henry Blalock Jr., who was arrested Thursday during a traffic stop in Westminster, was charged March 3 with multiple felonies for break-ins in Santa Ana and Huntington Beach, according to court records. In Huntington Beach, Blalock is accused of burglarizing Moores Sewing at 15041 W. Goldenwest St., on Nov. 24 and Dec. 26, according to Officer Jennifer Marlatt. In both burglaries he allegedly took high-end sewing machines, Marlatt said. A Westminster police officers traffic stop led to a search warrant issued for the defendants home, where a bottle of wine worth $2,400 was found, according to Santa Ana police Cpl. Anthony Bertagna. In a May 28 burglary at the Wine Exchange at 1544 E. Warner Ave., Blalock took a 2007 vintage of Domaine de la Romanee-Conti worth $30,000, Bertagna said. He also allegedly got away with another bottle of wine worth $3,000, a bottle of Champagne Boerl & Kroff Brut Rose Magnum worth $5,500, and 13 bottles of wine worth $220 apiece, Bertagna added. In a June 29 burglary at the same store he took two bottles worth nearly $9,000, Bertagna said. When he allegedly tried to steal from the store again he broke a window, which triggered an alarm and he ran away without any loot, Bertagna said. In the five cases, Blalock is charged with four counts of burglary, three counts of grand theft, two counts of vandalism, a count of receiving stolen property, all felonies, as well as a misdemeanor count of possession of burglary tools, according to court records. He also faces a sentencing enhancement of committing a crime while released from custody on another case. Blalock also faces sentencing enhancement allegations for prior convictions, according to court records. He was charged in a separate case on Oct. 22 of theft with a prior conviction for car theft, buying or receiving a stolen vehicle or equipment with a prior felony conviction and faces sentencing enhancing allegations of committing a crime while on bail for another case, according to court records. In another pending case from February of last year, Blalock is charged with two counts of possession of drugs with an intent to sell and a count of possession for sale of drugs, all felonies. Blalock pleaded guilty to burglary March 6, 2012, and was ultimately sentenced to 16 months in jail for violating terms of probation following his release, according to court records. He pleaded guilty to burglary, a felony, and a misdemeanor count of possession of burglary tools, on June 12, 2009, and was sentenced to 16 months in prison. On July 23, 2007, Blalock pleaded guilty to grand theft auto, car theft, and buying or receiving a stolen vehicle or equipment, all felonies, as well as a misdemeanor count of resisting arrest, according to court records. For that case he was placed on three years of probation and sentenced to a year in jail, according to court records. Blalock, who was being held on $485,000 bail, was ordered to return to court on Tuesday. City News Service; Photo by Camw via Wikimedia Commons",0
"Statistics show the number of arrests being made by British police has collapsed — while forces focus increasingly on so-called “hate crime” and “malicious communications”.

New Home Office figures reveal that arrests have plunged 12 per cent over the last year, and by a remarkable 48 per cent over the past nine years, MailOnline reports.

Police arrested some 1.5 million people in the year ending March 2008, but just 779,660 in the year ending March 2017 — despite huge increases in recorded crime.

Total crime has risen by 19 per cent in the year to June 2017, with violent crime up 19 per cent, rape up 22 per cent, knife crime up 26 per cent, and gun crime — despite draconian controls on legal gun ownership — up by an astonishing 27 per cent.

Acquisitive crimes (e.g., shoplifting, burglary, robbery, and theft) are also on the increase — and a suspect is only identified in one burglary out of 10.

England Policing Crisis: Crime up 13 Per Cent, Rape up 22 Per Cent, Just One in Nine Burglaries Solved https://t.co/cnhoCUa2Yz — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 19, 2017

Police lay the blame for the sharp drop in arrests on swingeing budget cuts, which have seen police numbers reduced by 20,000 constables to their lowest level since 1985.

There is strong anecdotal evidence that these cuts have indeed hollowed out community policing to a certain extent, with veteran officers arguing that they have left forces blind in areas where radical Islam is thriving and reduced the flow of local intelligence to the security services.

The Tories, who have been making cuts first in conjunction with the Liberal Democrats and then on their own after the end of the 2010-15 coalition, argue they are necessary to reduce the deficit bequeathed to them by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown — but they have been made at a time when the foreign aid budget and financial contributions to the European Union have been increasing year on year.

What Free Speech? British Police Arrest At Least 3,395 People for ‘Offensive’ Online Comments in One Year https://t.co/6sB2P99162 — Jack Montgomery ن (@JackBMontgomery) October 14, 2017

There are also suggestions that British police forces are not deploying their reduced resources wisely, however.

For example, arrests for supposedly offensive comments online were in the thousands in 2016; up by 53 per cent in London — now more dangerous than New York City, where police numbers are roughly comparable to London — and by an extraordinary 877 per cent in the West Midlands.

The Metropolitan Police have even suggested they will not even bother investigating many so-called “low-level” crimes such as shoplifting and vandalism anymore as it is “not practical” in a time of cutbacks — while boasting of having more than 900 specialist officers dedicated to “hate crime” investigations.

Police forces have also been an embarrassed by a series of bizarre stunts, calling on people to report “non-crime hate incidents” on Twitter and having male constables wear red high heels to raise awareness of domestic violence or paint their nails to raise awareness of modern slavery.

Many have compounded the poor publicity generated by the news surrounding these events by taking umbrage at the negative reception they have received online and threatening to track down social media users who have directed critical remarks at them.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A 19-year-old man has been indicted for hate crimes connected to threats against Jewish community centers, as well as threatening the Israeli embassy and cyberstalking, the U.S. Justice Department said on Wednesday.

Michael Kadar was arrested in Israel last year and is awaiting trial there. U.S. and Israeli authorities have previously charged him with making thousands of threats, including to airports, schools and Jewish centers, in the United States in 2016 and early 2017.

Kadar, who holds dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship, was indicted by grand juries in Florida, Georgia and the District of Columbia for making threats from January to March 2017, the Justice Department said in a statement.

The statement did not say whether he would be extradited to the United States.

Kadar is alleged to have telephoned the Anti-Defamation League with a bomb threat and making a bomb threat in an email to the Israeli embassy in Washington, both in March 2017, the Justice Department said.

Kadar, who is Jewish, was indicted for allegedly calling police in January 2017 about a hoax hostage situation at a home in Athens, Georgia, which included a threat to kill responding officers. Kadar also faces a federal cyberstalking indictment in Georgia.

In Florida, Kadar was charged with making multiple threatening calls about bomb threats and gun attacks against Jewish community centers throughout the state in January and February 2017. He also is alleged to have made bomb threats against the Orlando International Airport and a school.

The hoax threats to the Jewish community centers forced widespread evacuations and raised fears of a resurgence in anti-Semitism.

U.S. authorities have said in court documents that Kadar advertised his services on AlphaBay, a now-closed online black market, and offered to threaten any school for $30. The Justice Department shut AlphBay down in July 2017.

"NAPA - A 22-year-old man in a Napa homeless camp stabbed an older man he was apparently dating late Monday night, and has been charged with attempted murder. Napa resident Jeffrey Alexander Funes was arrested when he returned to the camp as officers were processing the crime scene. Just before 11 p.m., officers were sent to a report of a stabbing in the 500 block of Lincoln Avenue. When they arrived, they found a 51-year-old man on a residential porch, bleeding from a stab wound to the stomach. The homeowner did not know the victim, who was transported to Queen of the Valley Medical Center, where police say he was treated for his wound. At last report, the stabbing victim is recovering in the ICU. Police say initially the victim was uncooperative on the porch with officers, but provided a statement at the hospital. The victim told officers that he and Jeffrey Funes are in a dating relationship and live together in a homeless camp in the area. According to Napa police, the victim told them Funes stabbed him in the stomach with a large knife while in their camp. Funes immediately left the area, according to the statement, and the victim went to the residential house for help. Napa officers went to the camp site where the incident occurred to process the crime scene. Moments later, Funes returned to the camp and was taken into custody. A knife was located in the camp site and police say Funes identified it as the one he used to stab the victim. During the interview with officers, police say Funes admitted to the stabbing and said it was planned. Authorities found out that Funes has two current Napa County probations with terms including obey all laws and search and seizure. Jeffrey Alexander Funes was booked at the Napa County Department of Corrections.",0
"A man caught traveling through Brecksville with three-fourths of a pound of marijuana in his car pleaded guilty to a few charges last month. Kevin K. Robinson Jr., 28, of Oakwood Village, is expected to be sentenced this week in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court for charges of drug trafficking, drug possession and possessing criminal tools. He faces up to eight years in prison. Robinson was pulled over Sept. 19 for a routine speeding violation on Brecksville Road, but wound up facing felony charges after police discovered the marijuana in the car, along with six bundles of cash totaling $6,100. As part of the plea agreement, Robinson forfeited the cash as well as a cell phone, according to a statement from the Cuyahoga County Prosecutors Office. He was also charged with two misdemeanors: speeding and endangering a child, because his daughter was in the car. But those charges were dropped. A report said officers who pulled over Robinson for speeding could smell fresh marijuana in the car. Robinson said he was on his way to court for a previous speeding violation. Because he was on probation, police were able to search his car without a warrant and came up with nearly a pound of marijuana and the cash, bundled into packs of $1,000. Rachel McCafferty and Debbie Palmer contributed to this report.",0

"A white University of Maryland student was charged Sunday with stabbing a black newly commissioned US Army lieutenant to death. Authorities said Sunday that they are now evaluating whether the incident was a possible hate crime.

University of Maryland police charged 22-year-old Sean Christopher Urbanski, of Severna Park, Maryland, with first- and second-degree murder and first-degree assault after Army Lt. Richard Collins III was stabbed and killed early Saturday morning in what authorities called a totally unprovoked attack.

The evaluation of whether it was a possible hate crime stems from Urbanskis involvement in a Facebook group called Alt Reich: Nation, police said Sunday. University Police Chief David B. Mitchell said he asked the FBI for help in the case after discovering the online group.

When I looked at the information that’s contained on that website, suffice to say that it’s despicable. It shows extreme bias against women, Latinos, members of the Jewish faith, and especially African-Americans,” Mitchell said at a press conference. “Which brings up questions as to the motive in this case. Knowing that, we will continue to look for digital evidence, among other items of evidentiary value.”

Urbanski was held on a no-bond status on Monday at a hearing where his parents were present to support him.



We believe he is a dangerous person who stabbed a perfect stranger at a bus stop, Prince Georges County States Attorney, Angela Alsobrooks, told reporters Monday. He is threat to the community, she said.

But at another news conference late Monday, Alsobrooks said Urbanskis motive remains unclear.

“We do not have enough evidence to say conclusively whether this is a hate crime,” she said. “What we can say is that we will leave no stone unturned.” She added that authorities need something probably more than just a Facebook posting to determine that the killing was a hate crime.

The stabbing occurred at around 3 a.m. Saturday morning, as Collins and two others were waiting for an Uber near the University of Marylands Montgomery Hall, police said. Collins, a 23-year-old student at Bowie State University, was visiting friends at the College Park campus, and he and his two companions watched as Urbanski, who was unknown to them, approached. Mitchell said Urbanski was yelling, perhaps screaming as he approached them, according to eyewitnesses. He appeared to be intoxicated, Mitchell said, adding that they were testing his blood to determine the use of other drugs as well.

According to Mitchell, Urbanski told Collins: Step left, step left if you know what’s best for you.” When a puzzled Collins said no, Mitchell said, Urbanski stabbed him in the chest and fled, police said. Collins died at the hospital.

The victim was due to graduate from Bowie State with a business administration degree on Tuesday and was recently commissioned as a second lieutenant in the US Armys intelligence division.

Prince Georges County Police arrested Urbanski shortly after the incident, while he was seated on a bench at a bus stop about 50 feet from the attack. Witnesses, including Collins friends, identified Urbanski as the assailant, and police said they recovered a folding knife in his front pocket. The incident was also captured on surveillance cameras.

Gordon Johnson, the FBI agent from the Baltimore field office, said that they would make a final determination of whether it was a hate crime after the homicide investigation was completed and they had looked at the evidence in totality.



Were going to evaluate that as an ongoing concern with respect to whether this was a hate crime or not, Johnson said.



“Anyone who feels empowered by what happened, the only thing I can say is that if you want to harm our students, you are going to have to go through us,” Mitchell told reporters Sunday. “We are not going to tolerate any harm brought to our students. Not on my campus. Not on my watch.”

Though Urbanskis Facebook page is now private, screenshots circulating on social media appear to confirm that he belonged to the Alt Reich: Nation group. By Sunday, the groups page had been taken down, but an archived snapshot showed that it was created in March and had about 1,150 members.

The description for the group reads: Controversial humor. Memes. Several posts display racist memes and offensive content about women.

Alex Goodman, an administrator for Alt Reich: Nation, confirmed to BuzzFeed News that the groups page had been taken down on Sunday, and described it as a meme and satire platform.",1

"A Valley Stream man that owns a Brooklyn-based medical supply business was arraigned on Wednesday with stealing more than $1 million from Medicaid. According to Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman, Kester Atumonyogo, 49, and his company Monack Medical Supply, Inc. were charged with billing Medicaid and Healthfirst, a Medicaid managed care organization, for an expensive nutritional formula while supplying patients with a lower-priced substitute and stealing over $1 million in the process. New Yorkers pay into Medicaid to meet the healthcare needs of the most vulnerable in our communities, said Schneiderman. They deserve to know their dollars are going to help people, not profit unscrupulous business owners. We will continue to investigate and prosecute those who steal from our Medicaid programs to enrich themselves with taxpayer dollars. According to the indictment, Atumonyogo used a fraudulent social security number to enroll Monack as a Medicaid-participating provider of medical supplies. The company then allegedly filed false claims to Medicaid and Healthfirst that Monack had dispensed to pediatric patients a highly specialized and expensive enteral nutritional formula, which is prescribed by physicians for patients who must obtain nutrients via a feeding tube and cannot metabolize dietary nutrients from food. According to Schneiderman, the investigation revealed that Medicaid and Healthfirst paid Monack for the specialized formula, although Monack only dispensed Pediasure or similar over-the-counter nutritional supplements, and at times administered nothing at all. The Medicaid reimbursement rate for specialized enteral nutritional formula is substantially higher than off-the-shelf or over-the-counter nutritional supplements. In total, Atumonyogo and Monack allegedly stole more than $1 million from the Medicaid program. The investigation also uncovered that Atumonyogo allegedly used two different dates of birth and claimed to have been born in two different countries. Using that false identifying information, Atumonyogo allegedly obtained two different social security numbers that he has used interchangeably since the 1990s. According to prosecutors, he used the second social security number he obtained to enroll Monack in the Medicaid program. Prosecutors also allege that Atumonyogo used a different social security number in 2006 to obtain welfare benefits, and that in October 2012 and September 2013 Atumonyogo filed false income verifications with the New York City Human Resources Administration, claiming that he only made $200 or less per week. The Attorney Generals investigation revealed that between March 1, 2012 and Dec. 31, 2014, Atumonyogo received at least $575,806.88 from Monack. Atumonyogo was charged with first-degree health care fraud, three counts of second-degree grand larceny, third-degree welfare fraud and two counts of first-degree offering a false instrument for filing. If convicted, he could serve up to 25 years in jail. Photo: Shutterstock",0
"Image via We Love Keytar Bears Facebook page

After a group of teens allegedly beat up legendary Boston street performer Keytar Bear last weekend, hundreds of fans across the city have donated to a fundraiser encouraging him to get back out there, NBC Boston reports.



Keytar Bear—whos become famous for donning a full bear suit and playing a keytar on the streets of Boston—was allegedly pounced on by a group of teens from New Hampshire last Saturday, according to police. The punks apparently ripped off his big, goofy mask, pummeled him, and yelled racial slurs before taking off with the cash hed made busking. The kids were later charged with assault, battery, and disorderly conduct, and prosecutors are now investigating the incident as a possible hate crime, the Associated Press reports.

Not long after the alleged attack, a local fan started a GoFundMe for Keytar Bear, encouraging folks to donate toward a new speaker, as his old one was damaged during the incident. So far, the campaigns raised more than $7,000.

We all love you, one fan wrote on the crowdfunding page. In a city thats a little starved for wacky, fun, artsy, public displays, youre much more valuable than you might know.



Over the years, Keytar Bear has become a kind of unofficial mascot for Bostons weird side. He usually can be found in bustling hubs across the city—near Harvard, outside Fenway, in front of Faneuil Hall—and no matter the weather (typically shitty), the street performer is always doin his thing.

While some were initially uncertain if or when Keytar Bear would return to the streets following the violent incident, the performer announced on Facebook Monday that hed be back to wiggling around in his suit soon.

Glad for the encouragement, he wrote. I dont know what the mood is [in] Boston right now but, after sitting home watching Johnny Mathis with grandma, Im in the mood to play music again.

"BAKERSFIELD, California -- A judge in the ironically named city of Bakersfield has issued a final judgment in favor of Tastries Bakery owner Cathy Miller; she can refuse service to customers based on her religious beliefs.

In February Kern County Superior Court Judge David Lampe, on a motion for preliminary injunction, allowed Miller to continue to deny customers until the case went to full trial reports Bakersfield.com. That final judgment was issued on May 1.

Miller was represented by the Freedom of Conscience Defense Fund, her lawyers are asking for $438,000 in legal fees. Although California will likely appeal the decision.

Judge Lempe came to his judgment based on the First Amendment.

“The State cannot succeed on the facts presented as a matter of law. The right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment outweighs the State’s interest in ensuring a freely accessible marketplace,” Lampe wrote in his ruling in February. “The right of freedom of thought guaranteed by the First Amendment includes the right to speak, and the right to refrain from speaking. Sometimes the most profound protest is silence.”

In August 2017, Mireya and Eileen Rodriguez-Del Rio were planning a wedding and sought Tastries Bakery to make their cake. Miller refused, telling the couple her religious beliefs would not allow it.

“Everyone is God’s creation and I love everyone,” Miller said in the past. “But there are certain things that violate my conscience, and my conscience will not allow me to participate in things that I feel are wrong. Most of what that’s based on is scripture.”

The Del Rio’s filed a complaint with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH), taking the case to court accusing Miller of violating the Unruh Civil Rights Act which prohibits refusal of service to patrons based on race, gender, religion or sexual orientation.

Lempe basically stated in February that Miller’s First Amendment Rights trumped the Unruh Civil Rights Act.

He said Millers rights were protected under artistic expression.

“A wedding cake is not just a cake in a Free Speech analysis. It is an artistic expression by the person making it that is to be used traditionally as a centerpiece in the celebration of a marriage,” Lampe wrote in the ruling. “There could not be a greater form of expressive conduct. Here, Rodriguez—Del Rios plan to engage in speech. They plan a celebration to declare the validity of their marital union and their enduring love for one another. The State asks this court to compel Miller against her will and religion to allow her artistic expression in celebration of marriage to be co-opted to promote the message desired by same-sex marital partners, and with which Miller disagrees.”

Although he sided with the defendant in this case, Judge Lempe warned that in other circumstances a business cannot discriminate. The difference being between an already made product as opposed to one that needs to be created artistically.

“A retail tire shop may not refuse to sell a tire because the owner does not want to sell tires to same sex couples. There is nothing sacred or expressive about a tire. No artist, having placed their work for public sale, may refuse to sell for an unlawful discriminatory purpose. No baker may place their wares in a public display case, open their shop, and then refuse to sell because of race, religion, gender, or gender identification,” Lampe wrote.

Today, the Freedom of Conscience Defense Fund wrote of their excitement regarding Lempes final decision:

The judgment now closes the case in Superior Court, but the government can still appeal the decision to the state court of appeals. If forced to comply with the government’s request, Cathy would have faced the possibility of losing her bakery. The Freedom of Conscience Defense Fund (FCDF) is defending Cathy at no charge.",1

"Suspect charged in Charlottesville rally death could face death penalty Copyright 2018 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Video

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (WRIC) -- The Department of Justice announced federal indictments on Wednesday for James Alex Fields Jr., the man accused of plowing his car into a crowd of people, killing one woman, at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia last August.

After a 10-month investigation, the DOJ indicted Fields Jr., a 21-year old from Maumee, Ohio, with 30 crimes, including one count of a hate crime resulting in the death of Heather Heyer.

In a news conference in Charlottesville today, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia, Thomas T. Cullen, detailed Fields alleged actions and the charges brought against him, calling them the most serious possible under federal law.

When he backed up at the top of the hill, at the top of Fourth street, Mr. Fields stopped the vehicle, Cullen explained. Suddenly, and without any instigation, or provocation or warning, he sped forward and went down Fourth Street at a high rate of speed.

He went through a stop sign...and drove directly into the crowd.

Cullen said that Fields had reportedly only stopped his vehicle once he struck a parked car.

Fields Jr. faces 30 separate civil rights violations, with counts 2 through 29 charged as hate crimes related to the attempt to kill dozens more.

Count 30, which Cullen explained as a bias-motivated interference of a federally protected activity resulting in the death of an individual, could be punishable by the death penalty.

With respect to the 30 counts, it is alleged that Fields acted in this case because of the race, color, religion, and national origin of that crowd at the bottom of the intersection, Cullen said.

Cullen said there has been no decision on whether or not his office will seek the death penalty, but the possibility will be considered.

Susan Bro, Heyers mother, shared her gratitude with the DOJs thorough investigation in a written statement:

My family and I welcome the Justice Departments efforts to pursue hate crime charges in the killing of my daughter Heather Heyer, a young civil rights activist and champion of equal rights for all people. We have worked diligently since Heathers death to further her legacy through the Heather Heyer Foundation. This development emboldens our mission to enable individuals striving for positive social change and fighting hate wherever it may live. We are thankful for this ruling and for all of the support we continue to receive.

When asked if it was fair to label Fields crimes as domestic terrorism, Cullen referenced Attorney General Jeff Sessions comments made days after the rally calling the actions of Fields as an evil act of domestic terrorism.

I think that was a fair characterization, said Cullen. He did explain that there is no domestic terrorism statute in the district, but it is a good label to describe conduct.

Cullen hopes the indictment quells any effort to incite violence at a proposed August 12 rally to commemorate the anniversary of last years event.

Were hopeful that in indicting Mr. Fields today, were sending a strong message that racially motivated hate crimes and violent acts will not be tolerated in this district.

Cullen said that the communitys law enforcement is prepared for any rally planned in August and believes these serious charges against Fields will serve as a warning for individuals who may attend with violent intentions.

Were hopeful that, in putting out this indictment today, that folks get the message that if they come to Charlottesville and engage in racially motivated violence, there will be severe consequences, Cullen said at the end of the roughly 20-minute press conference.

Cullen said he expects Mr. Fields to be in federal custody by next week.

“White people of this country are going to kill you out of this country,” an unidentified man said in one of several voicemail messages he recorded on the mosque’s answering system, Raw Story reports.

He also promised to “mass slaughter” the mosque’s congregation.

The Georgia chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) announced Wednesday that following these troubling calls, mosques throughout the state are on high alert.

The calls reportedly began back in June and seem to be coming from a Missouri phone line. Raw Story notes that this isn’t the first time that the unnamed mosque has been targeted by anti-Muslim extremists.

It’s no secret that President Donald Trump’s anti-Muslim rhetoric has contributed to the uptick in hate crimes and Islamophobic sentiments nationwide.

“There doesn’t seem to be a single marginalized population that was left out of the emboldened reaction to this election,” said Heidi Beirich of the Southern Poverty Law Center back in June. “There has been a massive explosion of violence across the country, and an increase in the number of hate crimes against virtually all minority groups. The numbers are definitely going up in 2017.”

The heartbreaking reality is that — thanks to the rise of far-right populism — innocent Muslims all over the world are living in fear each day that they may become a victim of a hate crime simply for practicing their faith.

"CINCINNATI, Ohio -- A man accused of vandalizing the home of a mixed-race couple with racist graffiti in December is being charged with a federal hate crime, reports say.

Samuel Whitt, 40, is charged with criminal interference with the right to fair housing and attempted arson, according to Fox 19. If convicted, he could face up to 30 years in prison.

Authorities say Whitt and his fiancee had been renting a home owned by Joe and Pat Jude until early November. They were evicted because they were not paying their rent.

The Judes returned to the rental home in early December after vacation over Thanksgiving to find racist graffiti scrawled throughout the home, including swastikas and the words white power. Cement was poured into pipes and paint was all over the walls, and damage to pipes resulted in flooding in the basement and collapsed a ceiling.

The vandalism caused an estimated $50,000 in damage, Fox 19 reports.

In this case, the tenant allegedly was interfering with the landlords rights to rent that house by trying to destroy it after being evicted again on the basis of the landlords race, color and familial status, U.S. Attorney Ben Glassman tells WCPO Channel 9.

Whitt was convicted of similar vandalism to a church in 2013, reports say.

The Judes home has since been repaired and new tenants moved in in March, WCPO reports.

RESTON, Virginia—Waleed Sanu has faced a painful dilemma this Ramadan. The question before the curly-haired teenager: Should he partake in the traditional predawn expedition from his mosque to a restaurant before fasting, or remain safely inside? Last year’s venture ended in unspeakable tragedy when his friend Nabra Hassanen was abducted from among a group of friends, raped, and murdered.

Sanu, 16, has opted for safety.

“We’ve learned from our mistakes,” he said, having walked in a group behind Nabra’s that night. “For me, I’m just going to stay inside.”

Early on June 18 of last year, Nabra, a high school sophomore, had just finished the prefast meal known as suhur at a nearby McDonald’s and was walking with 15 of her friends to the All Dulles Area Muslim Society (ADAMS) Center mosque in Northern Virginia for Ramadan prayers. The man charged with her death, Darwin Martinez Torres, an undocumented immigrant from El Salvador, is believed to have been driving by at about 3:40 a.m. when he got into an argument with one of the boys on a bicycle. After pursuing the group in his car, Torres parked and then chased them on foot, a metal baseball bat in his hand. Torres, who is accused of beating Nabra with the bat and then driving her to a nearby pond and raping her, now faces a possible death penalty. Hours after the killing, according to a police warrant, Torres was apprehended by police, admitted to the attack, and led them to her body.

When Torres chased the teens, Nabra had been at the back of the pack. Likely making matters worse, she was wearing a hijab and her mother’s blue abaya, a long Muslim dress, making it difficult for her to run—which friends said she disliked to do in the first place.

“The police can say whatever they want, but I believe with all my heart that it is a hate crime.” — Mohmod Hassanen, Nabras father

Nabra’s murder prompted vigils across the country and has become a point of simmering dispute—particularly about what actually triggered the attack. Over the past year, nearly 75,000 people have signed an online petition calling for the case to be investigated as a hate crime, which will be presented to the Virginia attorney general’s office and the U.S. Department of Justice around the anniversary of Nabra’s death. The day after Nabra’s killing, Fairfax County police attributed the incident to “road rage” and have said that they have found no evidence that she was targeted because she was Muslim.

But as the anniversary of Nabra’s killing approaches, the dilemma facing Sanu and other Muslim teenagers in Virginia is a microcosm of what confronts Muslims nationwide as incidents of Islamophobia continue to rise. When does taking steps to ensure one’s safety cross over into leading a life dictated by fear? While parents and mosque leaders are urging caution, many young Muslims insist that giving in to the threat is not the answer. The uniquely horrifying aspects of Nabra’s death, how she was torn from her friends during the most sacred time of the year, have only made the debate that much more fraught.

“This Ramadan, me and my siblings are not going to stop. We are going to go out like we always do,” said Omar Gorashi, whose sister was one of the teenagers with Nabra when she was killed. “It doesn’t help to have Muslims cowering inside. We need to practice our faith and be a part of society. I want parents to have a change of heart and let their kids go out.”

For parents in a community still gripped by mourning, the question of what to do about suhur, especially during the final 10 days of Ramadan—when youths often sleep at the mosque—has been inextricably connected to the question of whether Nabra was targeted for her religion. Some have told me they agree with police that Nabra’s death was not anti-Muslim and patiently await the outcome of the legal case. The mosque’s leadership has said little in recent months, but one member who asked not to be identified said, “We feel the police did a wonderful job and now we trust the judicial process. People who say otherwise, I suspect are just trying to rationalize what happened.”

One parent who disagrees is Nabra’s father, Mohmod Hassanen, who moved his family to the leafy Reston suburbs a decade ago in large part because of its reputation for safety. He believes there is no question that his daughter’s killing was a hate crime.

“Why did he go after her?” he said in his Reston apartment this spring. “All the girls were wearing Muslim clothing, that’s what caught his eye. The police can say whatever they want, but I believe with all my heart that it is a hate crime.” So far, prosecutors have also given no indication they have additional evidence pointing to a hate crime. But lawyers advising the Hassanens say that the case can still be reclassified as long as the discovery phase remains open.

Even for those who are undecided, one detail of the case stands out: that the confrontation was initially between Torres and one of the boys. If that was so, then why did Torres assault Nabra? “It was not Nabra who did the thing to him. It was one of the boys, so why didn’t he go after the boys?” said Mohamed Yousif Wardi, a close friend of the family’s. “The police can say it was just road rage. He can say it was road rage. But how does anyone know what was really in his mind?”

In April, a large gathering of Nabra’s family and friends came together at the Reston Community Center to watch a documentary about a mosque in Mali established in her name by Pious Projects of America, a nonprofit in Illinois that sponsors humanitarian projects around the world. As photographs of Nabra’s grinning face flashed on the screen, many of her friends wept openly and hugged one another.

For them, the past year has been a difficult one. As one friend who did not want to be identified for this piece explained it, “I think there is some feeling of blame on us for what happened.” Many of Nabra’s friends can’t help but wonder whether they might have been able to help her—if there was more they could have done. According to the police affidavit for a search warrant, the confrontation began with Torres chasing the group with his car. Two of Nabra’s friends told me the boy on the bicycle threw something—a smoothie, one said—at Torres’ car when it came too close. As the group fled toward their mosque, one of the teenagers looked back and saw Nabra “lying on the sidewalk with a Hispanic male standing over her with a baseball bat.” (Neither the police nor Nabra’s friends would say who the teen was.)

“It was only when they made it to the ADAMS center that they realized they were missing one of them, and that another one of them had seen what was happening,” said Joshua Salaam, ADAMS’ chaplain at the time and the mosque’s former youth director. Salaam described the initial response as, “Why did you run? Why didn’t you tell us someone was left behind? Initially, there was a lot of blaming going on about how to manage their guilt and anger.” The teens I spoke to described a chaotic scene as they ran, terrified, back to the mosque without realizing what had happened behind them, or that one of them had briefly seen Nabra on the ground.

Nabra’s larger group of friends still talk about what happened that night. Police confirm that Torres got into an argument with one of the teenagers, but have not said what it was about. Jammel Chinas, one of Nabra’s close friends, was not with the group that night but has talked with many who were. She said, “There was one guy there that night who provoked (Torres). He feels really bad. Look, anyone there that night would blame themselves.”

“There was a lot of blaming going on about how to manage their guilt and anger.” — Joshua Salaam

In the months after Nabra’s death, Salaam participated in a broad community effort to help the teenagers process their grief. Nabra, who was the oldest of four, and a number of her friends lived in the same Reston apartment complex, Cedar Ridge, which is home to a diverse population of Somalis and Nubians. When the school bus pulls up in the afternoon, many of the girls who step out are dressed in colorful hijabs, as are their waiting mothers.

Like the Hassanens, many Muslim families moved here precisely because of Reston’s reputation for safety as well as its quality schools. Established in 1964 as a planned community, the town of 60,000 was designed to harmonize green space and building development. Although the community, a half-hour’s drive from Washington, D.C., is predominantly white and affluent, the Muslim families I interviewed consider it to be relatively tolerant. While several families noted that neighborhoods tend to be segregated, none reported any incidents of harassment. Reston is just a few miles from the ADAMS Center, which serves several thousand Muslim families in Northern Virginia and is one of the largest mosques in the country.

In the chaotic days after Nabra’s murder, a community room in the Cedar Ridge complex was devoted to helping families process their grief. Volunteer counselors and therapists ran workshops attended by some of Nabra’s friends. As Salaam described it, “Some of them couldn’t sleep, or they didn’t want to tell their families what they were going through.” But in time, Salaam added, “people stopped showing up. It all felt too foreign.”

Part of the reason it didn’t work out was that the groups were too big. Also, some in the Muslim community were just uneasy with the therapeutic process. In the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, when the media and other alarmed mosques began to ask questions of the Reston community, many of Nabra’s friends decided not to talk publicly. To this day they remain guarded about the details of that night.

Waleed Sanu, who was at the McDonald’s before Nabra’s group headed back to the mosque, said that those who were with her “think it’s easier to just talk among themselves and not with other people. You know, Nabra was ours.”

Sanu attended school with Nabra and lives in Cedar Ridge. Often, Nabra would come over and talk fashion with his mother and try on some of her clothes. Her death has changed the way he sees things.

“I have learned that the tragic stories we hear could be any one of us,” he said. “I have learned that we are not invincible. I just look at my life differently.”

The Nabra her friends have described was a young woman who helped those in need, whether friends or strangers. During the holidays she helped pack boxes of food for the poor. At her weekend job at McDonald’s, she bought food for a regular homeless visitor, and when walking in Reston would often pause to speak to or buy snacks for a homeless person. Her father recalled, “I’d go get into the car, and she’d still be there talking to the person, asking questions and listening.” On what would have been Nabra’s 18th birthday in April, dozens of her friends traveled to Washington and handed out water and food to the homeless. As her close friend Shahed Mohamed explained, “That’s what Nabra would have wanted.”

Nabra had decided to “cover” herself, or wear hijab, upon reaching puberty because she wanted to be more devout, as her friends describe it. But that didn’t keep her from wearing bold colors and experimenting with looks and flashing tiny gold rings in her nose. She had recently begun knotting both her dark hair and her hijab in a stylish bun atop her head.

Her many Instagram photos capture a forthright confidence, her makeup applied to highlight a full mouth and bright eyes. She preens and beams into the camera through her large black glasses, a pink scarf tossed over her shoulder or a halo filter of artificial spring flowers framing her head. In some photos she stares solemnly; in others she hams it up with her friends.

“She always wore a different lipstick, sometimes black or purple,” said Jammel Chinas. “Sometimes she wore black matte lipstick with sparkles on it. People were like, ‘Wow!’ Every week she had a new eye shadow palette.”

On the day I visited her home, her mother Sawsan Gazzar showed me boxes of Victoria’s Secret perfume and Nabra’s favorite MAC makeup stashed in a top closet shelf. A cluster of her purses, some black and others red, hung neatly on the back of the door.

Gazzar pulled an elegant aqua abaya out of the closet, explaining, “This was one of her favorites.”

Her dream, her friends said, was to become a designer and to travel.

“I remember we were all walking to a shopping center last year talking about our future and Nabra said, ‘I really want to go to college,’ ” recalled Chinas. “She said, ‘I don’t want to stay in Reston and I don’t want to work at McDonald’s. I just want to learn and see the world.’ ”

Little is known about Darwin Martinez Torres, the man accused of stuffing Nabra into his battered red Pontiac on a June dawn last year. Twenty-two at the time of the killing, the Salvadoran national had entered the U.S. illegally several years earlier. In the weeks after Nabra’s death, it was rumored that he was a member of the international gang MS-13, but police have since said that he was not.

What he was known as was an installer of air conditioners. A compact man with a cap of dark hair, he lived in a Sterling apartment with the mother of his two children and has other family in the area. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say they have had no earlier contact with him.

If you did it because we are Muslim it is horrible, but the fact that you did it at all is beyond horrible. — Ieasha Prime

Not a great deal more is known about him, nor has he uttered more than a few words in court. He did not react when at a court appearance last October Nabra’s father shouted and lunged at him, and Nabra’s mother threw her shoe. The facts of the case, as described by the police, are succinct: After he beat Nabra with his bat, Torres reportedly drove her nearby to his apartment and raped and murdered her before dumping her body in a nearby pond. Soon afterward, he returned to the scene of the abduction and was arrested by police. Police found a pair of eyeglasses and sandals on the sidewalk where Nabra had last been seen. Dressed only in his pants, Torres described the assault and led detectives to Nabra’s body, according to the search warrant.

Now, his defense team is trying to learn more about him in hopes the information they unearth will provide some context to the horrific charges. With the court’s approval, they’ve hired a “culturally competent mitigation specialist” to make several visits to El Salvador and learn about his background there. (Such specialists are routinely used in capital cases to ensure that a defendant receives a fair trial.) In May, a Fairfax County judge appointed experts to evaluate whether Torres might be intellectually disabled and therefore possibly barred from facing the death penalty. His lawyers maintain he may have been exposed to toxins from a gold mine that tainted food and groundwater near his childhood home in El Salvador.

Fairfax County Commonwealth’s Attorney Raymond Morrogh, who issued the eight-count indictment against Torres last fall, has said little about the case. Casey Lingan, the county’s deputy commonwealth’s attorney, argued that it would be virtually impossible to ascertain what Torres had consumed over two decades ago. At the May hearing, he dismissed the defense move as “neuro-witchcraft.”

ADAMS was not the only Virginia mosque affected by Nabra’s death. At the Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center in nearby Falls Church, there’s also been talk among teenagers who attend there about what happened to Nabra and whether her killing was a “hate crime.” The teenagers are divided. But they have also been asking the larger question: Does it matter?

“To be honest, it being a hate crime weighed a lot less,” explained Ieasha Prime, the mosque’s former youth coordinator and current director of women’s programs. “If you did it because we are Muslim it is horrible, but the fact that you did it at all is beyond horrible.”

The Dar Al-Hijrah teens have also debated whether staying inside the mosque on Ramadan nights amounts to a kind of cultural submission. Youth leaders have taken steps to keep kids out of harm’s way. They established a “lock in” at the mosque during Ramadan that prohibits young people from leaving once they’ve come in during the evening, and posted a sign advising parents that they are responsible for their children on the premises. Just as important, they enhanced programming to be more attractive to young people and added pancakes to the suhur menu.

But no one fully expected that some kids wouldn’t leave anyway.

“To be honest, the girls are way more cautious than the boys,” said Prime. “You will not see a lot of girls going out. The boys, well, there are just some kids who feel we can’t let those who don’t wish us well prevent us from our routine, and especially during Ramadan.”

A half-hour away, in Reston, some of Nabra’s friends have also tired of talk about hate and grown weary of the assumption that when bad things that happen to Muslims, it is necessarily related to their faith. As these kids see it, that assumption its own kind of reductionist racism.

“When something happens to nonwhite people, people automatically think it’s a hate crime. They don’t see the other side, they are so quick to judge,” said Chinas. “The public will only see what the media says, but we people who were close to Nabra know the truth. We know it was not a hate crime.”

“The bigger point is there is a lot of hate in the world,” Omar Gorashi agreed. “There’s no way to tell if this was a hate crime or not. Saying that it is just divides us, it doesn’t help us.” Gorashi said that this past week, some of the older kids have still been leaving the mosque for suhur, while some younger kids have been kept home by their parents.

ADAMS Center leaders declined to respond to questions about whether security had been increased at the mosque or what the official policy is for leaving the building. The uncertainty had been frustrating for some parents, including Mohmod Hassanen, who said, “The mosque needs to be responsible.” Joshua Salaam, who recently left his position at the mosque to become the chaplain at Duke University, said part of the reason for the mosque’s silence is that staff there, too, have experienced a kind of trauma.

Gadeir Abbas, an attorney for the Council on American–Islamic Relations, which has provided legal advice to the Hassanen family, told me that the hope was for Muslim families to continue their customary Ramadan rituals despite acts of violence. As Abbas put it, “Trauma lingers but we hope Muslims don’t stop being Muslims.”

Going out to fast-food restaurants for suhur had been a kind of treasured coming-of-age ritual. Salah Shuaib, whose daughter was with Nabra the night that she died, said his daughter and her friends are not going out for suhur, even though he was undecided about whether Nabra’s murder was a hate crime. Of his daughter he said, “If she goes to the mosque, I will go with her.”

Shahed Mohamed, another of Nabra’s close friends, said she would also stay in the mosque.

“I’ll still be active in my religion, because that’s what this month is for,” Mohamed said via text message. “But after everything that happened, I know now to be careful and not to leave the mosque if we were to go … I know to be cautious.”

Mohmod Hassanen said that he had no idea Nabra would even be going outside the mosque at night a year ago. If he had, he added sadly, “I would have made sure she had a phone. Hers was broken and I had just paid for a new one, but we did not have it yet.”

As the final days of Ramadan approach, many of the Hassanens’ questions about Nabra’s murder have come no closer to being resolved. Some answers, presumably, will have to wait until the trial gets underway in January. In the meantime, the Hassanens are taking a different step to reach some kind of understanding.

Earlier this month, the Hassanens and their three daughters departed for Egypt, where they will stay for the rest of June and mark the anniversary of their eldest daughter’s death with extended family. There, by the soothing waters of the life-giving river that Nabra loved, they hope they will find some resolution.

“Every night, I see her in my dreams,” said Mohmod before they left. “It is so hard to sleep here. We must go and sit by the Nile with our family. I think Nabra will be there.”

"× 2 Charged in Santa Monica Stabbing of Alt-Right Figure’s Bodyguard; Police Don’t Believe It Was a Hate Crime

Two men were charged with attempted murder Tuesday in the stabbing of a man who works as a bodyguard for a nationally known figure popular among the alt-right, prosecutors said.

Edgar Khodzhasaryan, 30, of Glendale, and Arsen Bekverdyan, 31, of Burbank, were charged with attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon in the stabbing following a dispute in a Santa Monica parking structure on Saturday, according to Sarah Ardalani, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office.

Tim Gionet, a popular alt-right Internet personality better known by his Twitter handle, @BakedAlaska, identified the victim as Antonio Foreman. Gionet did not witness the attack but said he spoke with the victim when he visited him in the hospital on Monday.

Gionet, who said Foreman sometimes works for him as a bodyguard, told his more than 175,000 Twitter followers that the assault was politically or racially motivated. Foreman is an ardent supporter of President Trump, and had been leaving an event in support of the president when he was attacked, Gionet said.

"Every June, Pride comes to our cities and towns. We break out the rainbow flags, march in parades, and celebrate our uniqueness and being together. But as Pride Month starts, this year feels different.

Sure, we will still celebrate this remarkable, diverse and loving community, but we are haunted by the wave of senseless violence that has targeted LGBT Americans. We’ll remember the tragedy at Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, where 49 innocent people were killed. We will remember the victims who die every day from gun violence, especially our transgender sisters of color, including Keke Collier, murdered in Chicago; Mesha Caldwell, shot in Mississippi; and Jaquarrius Holland, who was just 18 when her life was cut short by a bullet in Monroe, LA.

This Pride, we will be forced to confront the reality that, because of inaction in Washington, some of our friends won’t be celebrating Pride 2017.

We know that the attack on Pulse Nightclub could have happened anywhere in America. It could have been Providence’s Mirabar or Elixir in Boystown. Gun violence is an LGBT issue and an American issue; preventing this needless loss of life must be a priority for all of us.

The statistics are real and they are shocking. LGBT Americans experienced the greatest number of hate crimes per capita. From 2014-15, the number of LGBT homicides jumped 20 percent. Sixty-two percent of the victims were LGBT people of color and 67 percent were transgender or gender nonconforming individuals. According to the FBI, 20 percent of hate crimes victims were targeted because of their sexual orientation.

As a community, LGBT Americans have always been forced to confront hate. Guns have just made it easier for people to turn their hatred into bloodshed.

Ten days after the Pulse tragedy, we took a stand on the House floor. Emboldened by American communities and with the memories of thousands lost in our hearts, we organized a sit-in to stop gun violence. The first-ever sit-in in the U.S. House had a simple request: allow a vote on two bills that would prevent further bloodshed, including one that would have prevented the Pulse gunman from getting a weapon.

Instead of offering compromise and common sense, Republicans attempted to silence our voices by turning off the cameras and shutting off the microphones. But the LGBT community and advocates across the nation offered up their social media channels to carry our voices.

Nearly a year later, we are still waiting for Republicans to summon the courage to allow a vote on this common sense, bipartisan and widely supported legislation that would help prevent another Pulse. We cannot afford to wait any longer; too many lives have already been lost.

We have no choice but to fight back and PRIDE is the perfect time to start. PRIDE started as a loud protest demanding our rights. This year, let’s make it an even louder protest demanding our right to live!

We literally cannot wait any longer to demand lifesaving action. Community members and tens of thousands of Americans are dying and the crisis is getting worse.

The LGBT community has always stood up and fought for what’s right. We fought for marriage equality, demanded resources to fight HIV/AIDS and defeated hate from the ballot box to our armed forces.

It’s a community that knows how to win. On every issue, the LGBT community and allies give the full measure of our talents, time and treasure. Preventing gun violence can be no different.

The LGBT community learned how to organize and fight through necessity. That need is just as real now.

This time, we aren’t just fighting for the lives of our LGBT brothers and sisters; we are fighting to save the lives of all Americans – in nightclubs, on college campuses, in movie theatres, on our city streets and tragically, at elementary schools.",1

"The FBI has finished its investigation about these flyers found around Iowa City last month. The flyers said love your race. They were likely connected to a neo-Nazi group, the National Alliance.

This flier appeared in parts of Iowa City this week. Photo provided by: Max Ostby.

The FBI finds that the person passing out the racist flyers is not technically committing a hate crime.

After further investigation, they have told authorities here in Iowa City there are three hate groups in Iowa. Authorities say one of them is in Des Moines while the other two are spread throughout the state. The FBI says there arent any with headquarters in Iowa City.

To try to stop anything like this from happening in future, the city encourages everyone to report anything they think might be similar to the racial propaganda.

We dont stand for that in Iowa City, said councilman Kingsley Botchway. As a councilman and a council perspective we dont stand for that type of hate to be done, regardless or not if its a crime. So again, I appreciate the things the Chief did and said to go above and beyond what the community was asking for to ensure that were doing the right things.

Botchway says the city is working with police to possibly have a public forum on the matter sometime in the future.",1

Authorities in Washington are trying to locate a driver who witnesses say intentionally backed over two young men at a campsite on Saturday after shouting racial slurs—killing one and injuring the other, local ABC affiliate KOMO News reports.

Over the weekend, James Jimmy Smith-Kramer—a member of the Quinault Indian Nation—had reportedly trekked out to the Donkey Creek Campground near Hoquiam, Washington, to celebrate his 20th birthday with a few friends. At about 1:30 AM on Saturday, a man in a white Chevrolet pickup truck pulled up to the campsite and began spinning doughnuts and driving aggressively, Lieutenant Brad Johansson, of the Grays Harbor County Sheriffs Office, told the Seattle Times.

According to a press release from the Quinault Nation, the driver started screaming racial slurs and war whoops at Smith-Kramers group, before intentionally backing over Smith-Kramer and his friend Harvey Anderson, 19. At one point, someone threw a rock at the truck, though police and witnesses dispute whether that happened before or after the driver hit the two young men. Those at the scene also said they heard a woman in the car screaming for the driver to stop before he backed over Smith-Kramer and Anderson and sped away.

The witnesses there felt [the driver] was intentionally trying to run these subjects over, Johansson said. This was willful.

Anderson was released from Tacoma General Hospital on Sunday after being treated for his injuries, but Smith-Kramer died at the hospital Saturday night. Now authorities are trying to find the unidentified suspect, whos wanted for murder, and find out whether or not the incident was racially motivated.

Our entire Tribe is distraught over this incident, Fawn Sharp, president of the Quinault Nation, said in a statement. We work hard to be good friends with our neighboring communities. If it is, in fact, determined that this was a hate crime it will add even more distress and sadness to our loss of this outstanding young man and the injury of the other.

"SMYRNA, TN — Federal agents say 165 guns have been stolen from Middle Tennessee gun stores in the last six months and those illegal firearms are starting to show up on the streets. Guns-n-More in Smyrna was robbed for the second time in less than a month Thursday. This time, a group of five thieves backed up a car, which had been reported stolen in an earlier carjacking, through the front of the Sam Ridley Parkway store and made out with 10 guns, plus ammunition and rifle parts. Twenty-four guns were stolen from the store during the August robbery. The vehicle is a gray Audi A4 with an Ohio license plate of FTN-8532. The suspects are four men in masks and one woman, whose face was uncovered. We do believe that these individuals are involved in other burglaries and robberies that have happened in the Middle Tennessee area, Smyrna Police Sgt. Bobby Gibson told WKRN. Local agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said there has been a rise in gun store thefts nationwide and that weapons stolen in those robberies are starting to show up on the streets, connected to other crimes. We have seen a little more violent acts when it comes to stealing those firearms, ATF Special Agent Michael Knight told Fox 17.

One of the police officers involved in the shooting of a young black man at a Walmart parking lot in California last month was an officer who got fired due to a hate crime in 2010 but later got reinstated, The Sacramento Bee reports.

The officer, Jimmie Alfred Walker, was confirmed as one of the four officers involved in the April 5 shooting of Diante Yarber that sparked a national backlash after it was revealed that the victim was unarmed.

Walker, who is white, was charged with two counts of battery, one misdemeanor count of violating a man’s civil rights, and one count of disturbing the peace following an August 2010 incident in which he allegedly assaulted and used racial slurs against a black couple.

The incident got him fired from the police force but an arbiter later ruled that the dismissal was wrongful, which forced the city to reinstate him and pay him $163,000 in back wages.

In the April 5 confrontation, Yarber’s lawyers also allege that the police officers used racial slurs against Yarber and his companions. One of the officers yelled “[expletive] we’re going to kill you,” attorney Lee Merritt said, citing interviews with witnesses.

According to medical reports, Yarber was shot at least 10 times with 30 bullets fired. In a Facebook post, Merritt described police actions as “an amount force that would have been deemed excessive in a war zone.”

"Incidents of hate crimes in Utah rose significantly for the first time in two years in 2016, and based on complaints and investigations this year, the local FBI believes those numbers will continue to rise.

Last year, local law enforcement reported 66 incidents to the FBI, ranking Utah No. 23 out of the 49 reporting states and the District of Columbia, according to recently released 2016 hate crime statistics.

Those 66 incidents encompass 72 offenses, or individual crimes, reported in 2016. The most common was simple assault, with 22 instances, followed by vandalism at 18 and crimes against society — drug, gambling, prostitution, weapons violation or animal cruelty offenses — at 13.

Incidents rose from 47 in 2014 and 50 in 2015, aligning with a national upward trend.

Across the U.S., agencies reported 6,121 incidents of hate crimes last year. That number marked a five-year high.

Of those, most were committed against people because of their race, ethnicity or ancestry, followed by their religious affiliation and sexual orientation.

Despite ranking No. 23 out of 50 reporting locales, Michelle Pickens, FBI supervisory special agent with the civil rights squad at the Salt Lake City Field Office, said she considers Utah’s numbers to be on the lower side of the national trend.

She attributes that in-part to the Beehive State’s demographics.

“When you compare us to other states, we’re not very diverse. So our incidents may not be as high as they are in diverse states,” she said. “However, that does not mean that they don’t happen here.”

Based on her department’s work this year, she also said incidents will continue rising.

Hate by the numbers

The annual FBI hate crimes report doesn’t break down statewide incidents by the targeted group, but Pickens said Utah didn’t deviate from those nationwide statistics.

Nationally, more hate crimes — 1,739 across the U.S. — were committed against black people than any other race. Anti-Hispanic or Latino incidents ranked second, at 344 incidents.

Jewish people were most likely to face the brunt of hate crimes targeting a person’s religion, with 684 reported incidents, about 54 percent of the total. Those incidents involved 862 victims, up nearly 18 percent from 2015 . Muslims were the target of 307 incidents, a nearly 20 percent increase from the year before.

Following that trend, that means of the 47 hate crimes in Utah that targeted race, most were committed because the victim was black. Of the eight reported crimes committed against someone because of their religion, it’s likely the perpetrator was anti-Jewish.

Bias against sexual orientation was the second most prevalent among Utah hate crimes, with nine reported incidents, compared to 1,076 across the country. National statistics show gay men were the most common targets of those crimes, accounting for 675 instances.

While Utah numbers are climbing, FBI Special Agent in Charge Eric Barnhart said the bureau isn’t ready to posit why.

“Is that better reporting? Are we doing better outreach to communities, saying if you experience this crime report it,” Barnhart said. “That’s what we don’t know, because it’s so underreported, we don’t know if it’s a true spike or just better reporting.”

Equality Utah Executive Director Troy Williams attributed the increase to the U.S.’s current rancorous political climate and politicians who are “stirring up fear towards people who are different.”

“I think that when that kind of political rhetoric towards undocumented folks, or Muslim Americans, or gay and transgender people, when that kind of rhetoric gets racheted up, it gives permission for people to inflict violence on minority groups,” Williams said.

The Southern Poverty Law Center’s analysis of the FBI statistics also attributed the nationwide increase in hate crimes — particularly those committed against Muslims — to politics, specifically the election and rhetoric of President Donald Trump.

Ajudicating hate

Among other causes, Equality Utah has advocated for an updated hate crimes statute to replace the current law, which doesn’t enumerate protected groups and is limited to misdemeanor-level offenses.

Since the statute was adopted in 1992, the law hasn’t resulted in an upheld conviction. Williams said that’s evidence it’s not working.

Williams said he hopes the recently released numbers encourage legislators to pass a more effective bill — and fast.

“This isn’t just for minorities. This is legislation that is needed for everybody,” he said. “We all have a race. We all have an ethnicity. We all have a sexual orientation and a gender identity, and a lot of us belong to a faith group.”

Hate crimes do get prosecuted in Utah, though. It just happens on the federal level.

A jury will hear one recent example Dec. 18 in U.S. District Judge Dee Benson’s courtroom. They will decide if Mark Porter violated his neighbor’s rights to fair housing.

The attack began on Nov. 3, 2016, when the 7-year-old boy, who is black, rode his scooter near Porter’s Draper apartment. Porter allegedly called the boy a racial slur and told him to go away.

The boy’s father came outside and told Porter not to speak to his son that way. That’s when Porter reportedly yelled, “You and your n***** son can get out of here,” and struck the man in the neck with a 1 million volt stun cane.

If convicted, Porter faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

Federal statutes set a high bar for prosecution, meaning only the most violent — or potentially violent — crimes get tried, even if a lower-level offense was seemingly committed because of a person’s race, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability.

An underreported problem

Despite recorded increases in incidents over the past five years, experts believe the instances are significantly underreported.

A Bureau of Justice Statistics survey of crime victimization from 2004 to 2015 found there are an average 250,000 hate crimes committed each year. Between 2011 and 2015, they found less than half of those crimes were reported to police.

Pickens said her department typically learns of cases through the news or local police — not victims.

“We wish more would come forward, but we think a lot of them are afraid to come forward,” she said.



Not only do victims infrequently report, but also many law enforcement agencies don’t share data with the FBI, typically because of a lack of resources and the relative difficulty of reporting to the FBI.

Of the 130 participating agencies in Utah, only 32 reported in 2016 — and that’s an increase from 2015, Barnhart said.

“How can we give these overworked, under-resourced departments an easy mechanism to give us that data?” he said.

"CHERRY HILL, NJ — The owner of six gas stations in South Jersey, including one in Cherry Hill, has paid $1,471,024 in back wages and damages to 24 gas station attendants to resolve violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), the U.S. Department of Labor announced on Friday. Manjit Guleria regularly required employees to work seven days a week, 10 or more hours each day, according to an investigation by the Department of Labors Wage and Hour Division. Guleria owns five Citgo stations and one Lukoil station, including the Citgo at 1510 NJ 38 in Cherry Hill. The FLSA requires that covered, non-exempt employees be paid at lease the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hours for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates for hours worked beyond 40 per week. Some states have established minimum wage rates that differ from the federal minimum wage. Where federal and state laws require different wage rates, the higher standard applies. Employees must also maintain accurate time and payroll records. Despite asking his employees to work long hours, Guleria paid them flat salaries that typically resulted in hourly wages well below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, according to the investigation. He also didnt provide additional compensation for overtime. He and his companies were found to have violated the FLSA by failing to pay employees the federal minimum wage or overtime. He also didnt maintain required payroll records. Under the terms of the settlement, 24 employees will receive $735,512 in unpaid minimum wage and overtime compensation and $735,512 in liquidated damages. In addition to the back wages and damages, Guleria paid a $8,976 penalty for the violations and has agreed to future FLSA compliance. The gas stations are now required to use an electronic timekeeping system to track employees hours worked, change break policies to ensure that they pay employees when they are unable to take breaks, and provide employees with information about their rights under the FLSA. In addition to the Cherry Hill Citgo, the gas stations are located at:Citgo, 400 NJ 38 in Maple Shade;Citgo, 102 Washington Crossing Road in Pennington;Citgo, 2006 Mount Holly Road in Burlington;Citgo, 469 Lenola Road in Moorestown; andLukoil, 2225 Admiral Wilson Blvd. in Merchantville. This settlement puts these wages into the hands of the employees who earned them, Department of Labor Southern Jersey District Office Director Charlene Rachor said. The Division encourages employers to avail themselves of the many resources we provide to help them to operate in compliance, and not to find themselves facing the liabilities that can come with breaking the law. New Jersey is one of two U.S. states that bar motorists from pumping their own gas. Gas stations in New Jersey employ full-service gas station attendants to operate gas pumps and provide related customer services. Businesses that violate the law gain a competitive advantage in the industry and undermine law-abiding employers, Department of Labor Regional Solicitor Jeffrey S. Rogoff said. We will vigorously enforce the law to ensure that companies that comply compete on a level playing field and to safeguard employees hard-earned wages. For more information about the FLSA and other federal wage laws, call the Divisions toll-free helpline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243). Information also is available at http://www.dol.gov/whd.

"The mayor of Portland, Oregon, is trying to stop what he describes as two upcoming “alt-right” demonstrations as his city continues to mourn the stabbing deaths of two residents who intervened in a possible hate crime.

Mayor Ted Wheeler on Monday called on the federal government to revoke the permit for a rally set for Sunday, and to deny permission for a second rally on June 10.

The two gatherings — backed by different organizers — are planned for a park on federal land, which gives federal authorities control over issuing permits.

“Our city is in mourning, our community’s anger is real, and the timing and subject of these events can only exacerbate an already difficult situation,” Wheeler posted on Facebook.

Two men suffered fatal stab wounds, and a third man was seriously injured, when they intervened in an incident on Friday on a Portland commuter train. Police said the men were trying to stop a man who was yelling anti-Musllim slurs at two young women — one of whom was wearing a hijab — on the train.

The FBI is assisting Portland police, who are leading the investigation and are trying to determine whether Jeremy Joseph Christian, charged in the killings, could also be charged with federal hate crimes. The attacks occurred hours before the start of Ramadan, a month-long Muslim holy period of fasting, prayer and charity.

Wheeler said the city would not issue permits for the June 4 and June 10 rallies, according to a statement. The federal government has already granted a permit for the June 4 rally, the mayor said. He urged the groups to cancel the rallies and asked their supporters to stay away.

“My main concern is that they are coming to peddle a message of hatred and of bigotry,” Wheeler told reporters, referring to organizers of the two rallies. “They have a First Amendment right to speak, but my pushback on that is that hate speech is not protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.”

Organizer: Suspect ‘has nothing to do with us’

CNN affiliate KATU said the “Trump Free Speech Rally Portland,” is scheduled for Sunday.

Joey Gibson is organizer of that rally. His Facebook page says the effort is “about fighting corruption and big government with the strength and power of love.”

Gibson told CNN Monday that the mayor “is using this as an opportunity to use these two dead people to silence us.” Gibson also distanced his group from the train-killings suspect, Christian.

Gibson said Christian showed up an April 29 free speech march he organized in Portland “with a bat yelling and screaming, cussing at people, using derogatory names.”

“Jeremy Christian has nothing to do with us. He hated us, he threatened me. We did everything we could to kick him out. We didn’t want him with us,” Gibson said.

In a video of the April free speech rally, Christian is seen shouting at people. At one point, Christian blurts a racial epithet, according to the video from reporter Doug Brown of The Portland Mercury weekly newspaper show.

Chrisitan, 35, identifies himself in one of the videos, and he’s also seen carrying the baseball bat, which he handed over to officers who approached him.

Christian has been charged with two counts of aggravated murder and one count of attempted murder, all felonies, in Friday’s attack aboard a Portland commuter train. The aggravated murder charges have the death penalty as a possible sentence. He faces several misdemeanors including two counts of second-degree intimidation.

Christian is scheduled to be arraigned on Tuesday, police said.

Police said Ricky John Best, 53, of Happy Valley, and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, 23, were killed in the attack.

The third man, Micah David-Cole Fletcher, 21, suffered serious but non-life-threatening wounds, police said.

Earlier, in an interview with CNN, Wheeler called the three men heroes.

“Their actions were brave; they were selfless, and it could serve as an example and inspiration to all of us,” Wheeler said.

When asked if he identified with Wheeler’s “alt-right” description, Gibson said: “When someone can explain to me what alt-right means, I’ll answer it. I’m a libertarian. I’m not right-wing, I’m for gay marriage, I’m against the drug wars.”

The so-called “alt-right,” is a far-right movement that has been linked to white nationalism, racism, misogyny and anti-Semitism.

ACLU: Government cannot shut down free speech

Gibson said he will not cancel the June 4 rally.

“If I cancel this rally and we don’t have a permit, you’re talking about hundreds of people just showing up in the park with no leadership, no voice of reason,” he said in a Facebook post.

The June 10 protest is called #MarchAgainstSharia, KATU reported.

The ACLU of Oregon, in a tweet on Monday, said: “The government cannot revoke or deny a permit based on the viewpoint of the demonstrators. Period.”

“We are all free to reject and protest ideas we don’t agree with. That is a core, fundamental freedom of the United States,” the ACLU said.",1

DES MOINES — A prominent civil rights attorney with the Department of Justice has joined the prosecution in the trial of a man charged with killing a gender-fluid Burlington, Iowa, high school student last year.

Christopher J. Perras of the civil rights division’s criminal section was officially installed in documents filed in Iowa court Friday. He will aid Des Moines County Attorney Amy Beavers and Assistant Iowa Attorney General Laura Roan in the case against Jorge “Lumni” Sanders-Galvez, who is charged with first-degree murder in the shooting death of Kedarie Johnson.

“The federal authorities are investigating the case as a federal hate crime, and so they would like to be part of the state case for seamless prosecution, should an indictment in federal court be handed down,” Beavers said of adding Perras.

Defense attorney Curtis Dial said Perras wont have any effect on the way we handle the defense.

Federal involvement in the case came to light in late September, when the defense requested the state provide “all of the federal grand jury testimony involving the Defendant and the testing results from the scientific testing from the federal bureau of investigations.

Burlington Police declined to comment Friday on whether any of their officers had been asked to testify at the grand jury proceedings, but others close to the case said they knew of people who had testified.

The Register requested comment on the case for the Department of Justice Friday and did not hear back.

Johnson, a well-liked junior at Burlington High whose death rocked his small community, did not identify specifically as transgender, his mother Katrina told the Register. He did enjoy dressing in women’s clothes and sometimes went by Kandicee with friends, but he always used the pronoun “he” and went by Kedarie in most of his daily life.

He had girlfriends, but “preferred boys,” Katrina said.

The New York Times reported Sunday that the move to add Perras was personally initiated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

A conservative, Sessions made headlines this month when he rolled back protections for transgender people in the workplace and asked the Justice Department to take the position that transgender people are not covered discrimination based on sex.

However, in a speech at the 2017 Hate Crime summit in June, Sessions said he would continue to enforce hate crime laws aggressively and appropriately where (transgender) individuals are victims.

Joshua Brandon Vallum was sentenced to 49 years in prison for assaulting and murdering Mercedes Williamson, he said. This is the first case prosecuted under the Hate Crimes Prevention Act involving the murder of a transgender person.

I personally met with the Department’s senior leadership and the Civil Rights Division to discuss a spate of murders around the country of transgender individuals, he continued. I have directed the Civil Rights Division to work with the United States Attorney’s Offices and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to identify ways the Department can support the state and local law enforcement authorities investigating these incidents and to determine whether federal action would be appropriate.

I specifically directed that the files of these cases be reviewed to ensure that there is no single person or group behind these murders or to what extent hate crime motivation lies behind such murders, he said. I receive regular updates on the status of that review.

If found guilty of a federal hate crime, Sanders-Galvez could face the death penalty.

"The following article is entirely the opinion of Philip Fairbanks and does not reflect the views of the Inquisitr.

Mark Meechan, a Scottish man who goes by the YouTube handle Count Dankula, had his first appearance in court yesterday for what may be ruled a hate crime. He was initially arrested after a video he uploaded of his pug performing the Nazi salute went viral. The video itself, titled “M8 yer dugs a Nazi,” has currently surpassed 3 million views. Meechan claims that his video was primarily made to annoy his girlfriend, Suzanne Kelly, but he seems to have gotten more than he bargained for.

In another Nazi-inspired scene from a Count Dankula video, Buddha, his pet pug, is shown watching video footage of Hitler at the Berlin Olympics from a documentary. In the video, Mark has trained Buddha to perform the familiar Nazi salute as he shouts “Gas the Jews” and “Heil Hitler.” Mark and his pug became famous (or infamous) overnight. Not everyone is laughing about the situation, however.

Ephraim Borowski is the director of the Scottish Council of Jewish Communities. He has spoken out about the video, calling it “grossly offensive.”

“It stuns me that anyone should think it is a joke. My immediate reaction is that there is a clear distinction to be made between an off-hand remark and the amount of effort that is required to train a dog like that. I actually feel sorry for the dog. In many ways, the bit I found most offensive was the repetition of ‘Gas the Jews’ rather than the dog itself. The other thing that struck me was the explicit statement that this was intended to give offence and intended to be the most offensive thing he could think of – and then he says he isn’t a racist – but unfortunately we hear that all the time from people. I’m no historian but it is the marching signal of the Nazi stormtroopers who contributed and supported the murder of six million Jews, including members of my own family, and I take this all slightly personally. Material of this kind goes to normalize the anti-Semitic views that frankly we thought we had seen the last of. The Holocaust is not a subject for jocular content.”

Wait a minute, Ephraim, did you say never a suitable subject for comedy? What about the multiple Oscar and Tony award-winning film and musical The Producers? Sarah Silverman is another Jewish comedian who has gotten big belly laughs making light of the Nazis and Holocaust.

In her popular comedy special “Jesus is Magic” she made the following joke referencing her niece.

“Aunt Sarah, did you know that Hitler killed 60 million Jews? I corrected her, and I said, ‘You know I think he’s responsible for killing six million Jews.’ And she says, ‘Oh, yeah. Six million. I knew that. But seriously, auntie, what’s the difference?’ ‘The difference is that 60 million is unforgivable, young lady.’ Kids. Try to figure them out, you can’t: They’re kids.

PBS’ Independent Lens did an entire documentary regarding taboo comedy topics that featured Holocaust humor extensively. The Last Laugh features several Jewish comedians like Gilbert Gottfried, Sarah Silverman, and others making jokes about the Holocaust and exploring other “taboo topics” for comedy.

Mel Brooks has been asked extensively about humor, Hitler, and the Holocaust. In an interview with Spiegel, he explains his practicum for poking fun at Hitler.

“Of course it is impossible to take revenge for 6 million murdered Jews. But by using the medium of comedy, we can try to rob Hitler of his posthumous power and myths. In doing so, we should remember that Hitler did have some talents. He was able to fool an entire population into letting him be their leader. However, this role was basically a few numbers too great for him - but he simply covered over this deficiency.”

"A letter penned by Utah’s Catholic Bishop Oscar Solis voiced support for a new hate crimes bill in the state legislature. A number of prominent local religious leaders added their signatures to the statement which called Utah a “gathering place” for all.

The letter released this week points to an FBI statistic from back in 2013 when there were 47 racially-based crimes in Utah. Last year’s bomb threat to the Wagner Jewish Community Center in Salt Lake is mentioned and then it takes a wider view — Muslim women afraid to wear headscarves in public and graffiti swastikas becoming more common.

What seems to be a major point of the letter is Utah’s own religious roots — the martyrdom of the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum and the pioneers eventual trek west.

If passed, the measure sponsored by Utah Senator Daniel Thatcher (R-West Valley) would increase punishments for hate-driven crimes based on gender, religion or race.

23 religious leaders signed the letter but noticeably missing from the letter is a signature from the LDS Church. Mormon leaders in the past have supported anti-discrimination legislation, but have yet to do the same for this bill.",1

"The administration has failed to explain why they are attempting to connect Shapiro with the racial hoax, instead merely dismissing the timing as “inappropriate.”

NORTHFIELD, Minn. – St. Olaf College has banned conservative commentator Ben Shapiro from appearing on campus this April, saying the event poorly coincides with the anniversary of last year’s hate crime hoax.

Conservative students at St. Olaf have been working since November to coordinate an event on campus featuring Shapiro. The event, sponsored by Turning Point USA, was scheduled for April 23, however, the administration called off the event a week before the contract was set to be finalized, calling the timing “inappropriate.”

Last April, St. Olaf erupted in protests triggered by a racist note left on an African American student’s car. The note was eventually revealed to be a hoax designed to draw attention and stir up racial discord on campus. Despite the source of the protests being fake, the school administration said the campus is “still healing” and having Shapiro speak nearing the anniversary of the disturbance would be “deeply concerning.”

“The issue is not about whether Ben Shapiro can come to our campus, but when,” St. Olaf President David Anderson wrote in an email to the event organizers. “As you all know, the only date that Mr. Shapiro has indicated he is willing to travel to our campus is at a time that coincides with the anniversary of last year’s protests. This is deeply concerning. Our campus is still healing from that experience.”

The administration has failed to explain why they are attempting to connect Shapiro with the racial hoax, instead merely dismissing the timing as “inappropriate.” Anderson claims they want the campus community to be “focused on building unity” as they approach the anniversary of the protests, saying an event featuring Shapiro would be “counterproductive to that goal.”

“One year after the unrest, I would like this to be a time where our community is focused on building unity,” Anderson wrote in an email. “For these reasons, having Mr. Shapiro come during the last week of April is counterproductive to that goal, and inappropriate.”

Conservative student and Turning Point USA chapter President Kathryn Hinderaker has been leading the efforts to bring Shapiro to campus, working to coordinate the event for almost a year when the administration shut it down. Hinderaker understands the desire prevent further provocation, however, she rejects the notion that Shapiro and the hate crime hoax have anything in common.

“Ben [Shapiro] and the racist note have absolutely nothing in common, so having them on the same day should be no issue at all if the school has any interest in fostering intellectual diversity among its students,” Hinderaker told Alpha News. “I had students emailing me for days after that expressing how disappointed they were in the administration. They robbed their students of an incredible opportunity, and I find that to be a real shame.”

According to Hinderaker, the school’s actions not only highlight a double standards for conservatives on campus, but also try to make a connection between racism and conservatism, an assumption she calls “completely false” and “offensive.”

“Would they allow a liberal speaker to speak on this day? Of course they would. This shows the connection the school is supposing between racism and conservatism. This assumption is not only completely false, but offensive,” Hinderaker said. “The school considering conservative thought to be racist shows a deep lack of understanding, along with a clear unwillingness to foster civil discussion among their students.”

The administration attempted to remedy the situation by encouraging the event coordinators to find another date. Having spent months working to secure the April date, Hinderaker explained there were no other 2018 dates available. Despite the inability to reschedule, the administration refused to reverse their decision. However, Hinderaker said the conservative groups on campus will continue to try to secure another conservative speaker for this spring.

“We are already planning to bring in a different speaker this spring, and hope to bring in a another conservative speaker this fall,” Hinderaker said. “Hopefully we will be allowed to follow through with these events.”

"In the wake of the fatal stabbing of, Richard Collins III, a Black student on the College Park campus of the University of Maryland, by an alleged White supremacist, confusion has grown over the legal classification of the murder as a ‘hate crime’. While to many communities of color across the nation the attack clearly constituted racial bias, FBI agents must now determine if Collins’ death meets the legal criteria for a hate crime prosecution.

The importance of proper prosecution, according to legal analyst Danny Cevallos, lies not only in securing additional prison time for those who commit crimes against others based on their race (gender, sexual orientation, religion, etc.), but also that a clear message resonates among subversive groups that their activities will be fully prosecuted.

Sean Ubranski, the University of Maryland student who allegedly murdered Collins, can be seen on surveillance footage approaching Collins near an on-campus bus stop, where he told the victim to “step left.” When Collins refused, Urbanski allegedly stabbed Collins. He is currently being held without bond while awaiting trial. University of Maryland Police Chief David Mitchell said Urbanski “had been drinking” and that he did not believe race played a role in the crime.

“In a hate crime, the victim is targeted because of his characteristics. These are bias-motivated crimes, and often they are much more violent than traditional crimes,” Cevallos told CNN. “Typically, in criminal law, motive is not an element of a criminal offense.”

Cevallos said law enforcement must prove that racial or religious hatred factored into the motive for the crime.

For UMD students, many of whom said they have experienced a recent increase in bias or prejudice on campus, the FBI investigation, seems only to dismiss their voices on the need for active anti-hate protocols on race, diversity, and safety on campus.

“The administration cannot govern everyone’s consciousness, but a murder committed by a student who embraces White supremacist ideology, suggests it could have been any student of color Ubranski killed that night,” UMD junior Makhi Ellis told the AFRO. “It seems logical to charge the guy with committing a hate crime, and even though I understand there are logistics the legal community has to explore, it feels like no one wants him to pay harshly for the crime.”

Ellis is not alone. Several students, including members of on-campus diversity groups such as “ProtectUMD,” according to WTOP, have called on UMD administration to do more to combat hate and promote diversity and safety on campus.

“I don’t want to say for certain that this particular incident could’ve been avoided, but I think that the sentiments underlying the attack could have better been addressed if the University stopped using its diverse image as an excuse to not address how students of color are able to exist in spaces that aren’t always the most inclusive,” UMD senior government and politics and philosophy double major Katelyn Turner told the AFRO in a text message. “Looking diverse isn’t enough. We need to protect the students that allow this campus to call itself diverse.”

Hate crimes, according to the FBI, are “criminal offenses against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity.” It notes that hate itself is not a crime and that their investigations must be mindful of protecting freedom of speech and other civil liberties.

"Nucera, 60, was originally charged last month with hate crime assault and deprivation of civil rights stemming from an alleged September 2016 assault of an 18-year-old African-American following his arrest at the Bordentown Ramada on Route 206.

CAMDEN — A federal grand jury has indicted former Bordentown Township police Chief Frank Nucera on hate-crime charges stemming from an alleged assault on an African-American teenager, as well as on new charges that he lied to FBI agents about it.

Nucera, 60, was charged last month with hate-crime assault and deprivation of civil rights stemming from an alleged September 2016 attack of an 18-year-old following his arrest at the Bordentown Ramada on Route 206.

Nucera, who was chief at the time, is accused of grabbing the handcuffed teen from behind and slamming his head into a metal door jamb by the hotel stairwell, the federal complaint said.

The incident allegedly occurred shortly after officers were called to the hotel on a complaint that the teen and a 16-year-old female companion were swimming in the pool after failing to pay for a room.

The teen got into a struggle with officers, and one of them used pepper spray to subdue and handcuff him. Nucera arrived with additional officers and allegedly assaulted the handcuffed teen.

An indictment released Thursday by the U.S. Attorney’s Office repeated the charges from the original complaint and added the additional crime of providing false information to the FBI.

According to the indictment, Nucera told FBI agents he never touched the teen during the arrest or while the boy was in custody.

“I didn’t touch any of them. … I had nothing to do with the physical arrest or anything. No,” Nucera allegedly told agents during a December 2016 interview.

“I didn’t talk to them, and I didn’t see any of the processing at the station,” the chief said when asked if he had any contact with the teen or his companion.

The indictment alleges that Nucera assaulted the teen because he harbored an “intense racial animus toward African-Americans.” After the assault, he was recorded by one of his officers making “racially hostile statements” about the teen, according to the indictment, which also indicated that the chief had a history of such comments.

According to the document, in one instance in 2015, Nucera allegedly told an officer: “These (racial slur) are like ISIS; they have no value. They should line them all up and mow ’em down.”

Nucera remains free on $500,000 unsecured bail while awaiting trial. His attorney has said he maintains his innocence.

The former chief’s career with the Bordentown Township force began in 1983. He spent at least the last nine years as chief before retiring suddenly in January after the FBI initiated its investigation.

State records show Nucera is receiving a $105,984 annual pension from the Police and Firefighters Retirement System, based on a final-year salary of $151,418.

Because the criminal case is ongoing, a spokesman for the New Jersey Attorney General’s Office has declined to say if the state intends to seek the forfeiture of Nucera’s pension.",1
"Call it Wendell Willard’s last act.

On Thursday, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee handed his gavel to state Rep. Barry Fleming, R-Harlem, in order to pull a surprise:

The reintroduction – and ultimate committee passage – of a hate crime bill that would add penalties to criminal acts motivated by a victim’s religion, race, national origin, homeless status, sexual orientation, or gender. The bill now goes to the House Rules Committee. Catch the video here.

Willard, a Sandy Springs Republican, is retiring after this session. He noted that he had supported a similar bill, HB 660, authored by state Rep. Meagan Hanson, R-Brookhaven, which never made it out of a subcommittee. Georgia is one of only five states without hate crime legislation.

The vehicle used was SB 373, a bill originally intended to give Cobb County an additional superior court judge – but shelved when it was discovered that the clerk of court had miscounted the number of cases Cobb judges handle.

In his introduction of the new content for SB 373, Willard recounted his coming of age in the ‘60s as a young banker who, when downtown, often witnessed protests against segregation – and the counter-protesters in support of white supremacy.

“I look back, and feel some shame that I did not step out more at that time,” he said. “While you’re not totally ignoring it, you’re not totally caught up and trying to correct the conduct of people.”

Past versions of the bill have had the support of law enforcement, including the GBI. “It doesn’t mean that you can’t sit there and say something bad about somebody,” Willard said. But criminal acts associated with the specific categories would be considered “a misdemeanor of a high or aggravated nature.”

Those testifying for and against the measure had made their views known in other hearings. But the appearance by state Rep. Calvin Smyre, D-Columbus, the longest-serving member of the Legislature and an African-American, was unusual. Smyre avoided specifics, but thanked Willard for his final effort.

The revival nearly foundered on two points.

The Anti-Defamation League initially withheld its support because the list of hate crime categories included “political views.”

“This inclusion would perhaps unintentionally give protection under the hate crime law to white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and other extremists,” said Allison Goodman, the ADLs southern regional director. She argued that the inclusion would create constitutional concerns.

Jeff Graham, executive director of Georgia Equality, acknowledged the inclusion of “sexual orientation” to the statute’s list of triggers, but objected to the exclusion of “gender identity.” Transgender persons are frequently the victims of violent assault, he said.

The committee attempted a word-by-word clawback. On Hanson’s motion, the word “gender” was added to the list of triggers. State Rep. David Dreyer, D-Atlanta, then moved to have the word “identity” added. The committee voted him down.

The phrase “political views” was then removed, also on a motion by Hanson, then passed on a hand vote.

U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan was in Smyrna on Thursday to meet with a gathering of Home Depot employees and to tout the GOP tax cuts passed last year. But he almost immediately was asked to address President Donald Trump’s promise – fulfilled later that afternoon – to slap heavy tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.

“The best policy is to be surgical and specific and go after those specific unfair trade practices,” said Ryan. “I’m not a fan of broad-based across-the-board tariffs, because you’ll have a lot of unintended consequences.”

Ryan and other Republicans in Washington, including U.S. Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., have tried to tailor their opposition – i.e., encourage Trump to narrow the list of countries that tariffs would be applied to – in order to appear less confrontational.

U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., may be going in the opposite direction, ramping up his language. This was an opening line from a statement issued Thursday afternoon, emphasis ours:



“Ultimately, trade wars do not solve the problems they are intended to address, but inevitably create more trouble,” said Isakson. “This new tax on American consumers will have lasting consequences and will impede the pro-growth agenda we have pursued.”

In Republican circles, calling something a “tax increase” is still powerful stuff.

Then there was Agriculture Sonny Perdue’s advice to farmers who fear that their commodities becoming pawns in a trade war. From Iowa Radio:

[...] “Pray,” Perdue responded, laughing. “…President Trump is a unique negotiator and sometimes he keeps people off-balance, even his own staff sometimes…He certainly did that this last week…He believes solely in his heart ‘America first’ and the American people first and that includes American agriculture.”

Democrat Charlie Bailey has received the endorsement of a key law enforcement group. The local chapter of the International Brotherhood of Police Officers backed his campaign for attorney general this week. Lt. Steve Zygai said the organization backs Bailey, a former prosecutor, because he “has put Georgia’s most dangerous criminals in prison.” Bailey is challenging Republican Attorney General Chris Carr in the November race. He’s the only Democrat in the contest, but former Atlanta city council president Ceasar Mitchell has also mulled about a run.

"Police responded to a reported hate crime that involved the vandalism of an LGBTQ information board on March 25 in the Fine Arts building.

A prankster performed the vandalism by replacing many of the letters in LGBTQ+ with just the letter “B.” The letters were drawn with a square surrounding them over the title of the display, similar to the “B” emoji. The “B” emoji is a popular meme, and as such, the vandal may not have had malicious intent behind the meaning of his crime.

Deputy Chief of Police Paul Dillon said that the incident was “originally written up as a destruction of property and hate crime, but after review, it will be classified only as a destruction of property. For it to be a hate crime, we would need to reasonably believe the motivation of the crime was a bias against members of the LGBTQ+ community. I do not feel writing the letter ‘B’ over the letters ‘G, B, T’ demonstrates a bias.”

According to the UMBC Police Department’s Clery Report, a hate crime is defined as “a criminal offense that manifests evidence that the victim was intentionally selected because of the perpetrator’s bias against the victim.” Hate crimes towards a person’s sexual orientation are also defined in the report as “a preformed negative opinion or attitude toward a group of persons based on their actual or perceived sexual orientation.”

The incident marks the first time a hate crime was reported on campus this year, though further investigation by police led to the conclusion that this act did not constitute a hate crime. The last time a hate crime was reported on campus was on Dec. 15, 2017, which involved a small swastika drawn in a stall in the women’s bathroom of the Fine Arts building. This indicates a major decline in hate crimes from last year, when a total of seven hate crimes occurred between October and December alone. Whether this trend will continue will remain to be seen as the year progresses.",1

EUGENE, Ore. - A Hate Crimes Forum was held in Eugene on Saturday in order to give the community a chance to meet with officials and learn how to respond to hate and bias incidents in their lives.

For the fifth consecutive year, the Eugene City Managers Office issued a report on both criminal and non-criminal hate and biased behavior.

According to the report, both the number of hate and bias incidents reported, and those which were indeed crimes, has increased.

We collect all the information in our office, said Katie Babits, a Human Rights and Equity Analyst. We do that because we want to create a whole picture of all the activity thats happening in Eugene. Hate and bias activity, whether it is a crime or not a crime, it still impacts a lot of our community members.

Babits says that the Downtown and West University neighborhood experienced the highest amount of hate and bias crimes, and vandalism replaced intimidation as the most common hate crime charge.

We want people to know that things are being done on the local level to address the impact of those crimes and also show people what their resources are and how they can access those resources, said Babits.

Chairman of Oregon Against Hate Crime, Randy Blazak, says while Eugenes hate crime numbers look larger than the rest of the state, its because of their aggressive approach to track the data.

Its hard to do a comparison from place to place, said Blazak. Because you have smaller sheriff departments and towns where they dont really actively seek out the data.

If it comes across their radar, theyll report it, but when you have an aggressive strategy to go after that data, it inflates the numbers and it looks like theres more hate happening.

Blazak says the real issue is that people not only feel safe in their communities, but are safe in their communities, and know that officials have their backs.

We take these issues very seriously, said Blazak. Hate crimes are acts of terrorism; theyre meant to impact wide groups of people, not just the immediate victims.

According to the Hate and Bias crime report, race continues to be the leading motivating factor in hate and bias crimes reported in Eugene. Of the 31 race-related hate crimes in 2017, 25 were committed against African-Americans.

"Timothy Trybus, a 62-year-old man from Cook County, Illinois, has been charged with a hate crime. Trybus first found himself as a viral sensation for all of the wrong reasons when video surfaced of him harassing a woman, Mia Irizarry, for wearing a Puerto Rico shirt. Trybus went on a racist rant, before being charged with misdemeanor assault for the verbal harassment.

However, on Thursday, July 12, the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office said that Trybus has also been charged with two counts of felony hate crime.

ABC 7 reported the news.

In the video, Trybus confronts the woman asking why she is wearing a Puerto Rico shirt in the United States. Despite police officers being on the scene and Puerto Rico being a part of the United States, Trybus continued his racist rant by wrongly claiming Puerto Rico wasn’t part of the USA and asking Ms. Irizarry, “Are you a citizen? Are you a United States citizen?”

Irizarry was asking a park police officer for help and repeatedly said that she felt uncomfortable until a female police officer finally intervened.

"It turns out that the racist graffiti and messages that appeared at Eastern Michigan University last year and sent students to the streets protesting were actually not concocted by a white student.

“A suspect has been arrested in connection with a string of racist graffiti incidents that occurred on the Eastern Michigan University campus last fall,” Martin Slagter reported on MLIVE on October 23, 2017. “Eddie Curlin, 29, was arraigned Monday, Oct. 23, in Washtenaw County District Court on three counts of malicious destruction of property, four counts of identity theft and one count of using computers to commit a crime stemming from vandalism incidents that took place on Eastern Michigan University’s campus beginning in fall 2016.”

“The suspect is a former student at Eastern who attended from 2014 to early 2016. He currently is in custody of the Michigan Department of Corrections serving a one-to-five year sentence on an unrelated charge of receiving and concealing stolen property.”

On September 20, 2016 Slagter had reported that “Eastern Michigan University is investigating who is responsible for spray painting the letters ‘KKK’ and a racial slur on the wall inside the courtyard of Julia Anne King Hall.”

"WASHINGTON (AP) — The FBI says hate crimes rose for the second straight year in 2016, with increases in attacks motivated by bias against blacks, Jews, Muslims and LGBT people.

A report released Monday says there were more than 6,100 hate crimes last year. That’s up about 5 percent from the year before. In 2015 and 2016, that number was driven by crimes against people because of their race or ethnicity.

More than half the 4,229 racially motivated crimes were against black people. And Jews were targeted in more than half the 1,538 religion-motivated crimes.

The yearly report is the most comprehensive accounting of hate crimes in the U.S. But authorities warn it is incomplete, in part because it is based on voluntary reporting by police agencies across the country.",1

"Love & Hate Crime is an upcoming three-part documentary airing on Investigation Discovery. The series looks at hate crime and prejudice in the United States through murders.

Part One scrutinizes the case that eventually becomes the first-ever hate crime conviction arising from the murder of a transsexual woman in Mississippi.

Part Two will explore another Mississippi murder, this time of a gay black man seemingly for kicks, and the consequences to a white girl who was in the truck that mowed him down. Part Three studies the mind of a man who falls for his victim, discovers shes a married lesbian and sets out to end her life.

Each part of the series features film-like quality, and part of that can be attributed to director Ben Steele, known for his Emmy-nominated work on Hunted: The War Against Gays in Russia.

Nothing about the murders is easy to understand. Thats especially true of the first two parts, which might even hit a little close to home depending on where you grew up.

What is a hate crime? Its not something I think Im ready to answer yet, but its not because Im an evil person or dont understand the fundamentals of what makes a hate crime.

There are so many nuances to love and hate and everything in between, and the series does a good job examining what it means to be a human being in this world at this very moment. Steele frames Part One in an unexpected and thought-provoking way.

Its the case of Mercedes Williamson, tragically murdered by Joshua Vallum.

During the hour-long Justice for Mercedes, Josh had not yet been charged with a hate crime and hadnt revealed his full involvement with Mercedes. It is easy to read the story from the outside, though, even if he uses the much-maligned trans panic defense.

If you dont know what that is, the short arc is Josh was dating Mercedes, and after two months, he finally talks her into sex, reaches down there and finds a penis. In the heat of the moment, he stabs her multiple times and crushes her head with a claw hammer.

Its filmed to bring you into Joshs story, specifically, to try to make you feel some sympathy for him. And it works, sort of, if you dont mind murder. Ill try to use myself as a guinea pig.

There are things in my life that I panic over every time they happen; so I can understand trans panic to a degree. Not that degree. Pushing them out of your life in the heat of the moment is one thing, killing them is quite another.

Thats especially true since Josh seems like a manly man. As a member of the Latin Kings gang, the idea he might be treating his new girlfriend with kid gloves and not having sex seems ridiculous.

The episode does a particularly good job of playing on our senses by not revealing Mercedes transsexual status for the first half of the hour. We are finally told that when the body was discovered, the authorities thought it to be Michael Christopher Wilkins.

Michael Christopher Wilkins is Mercedes birth name.

The transsexual hate crime came to light when Sun Herald reporter Margaret Baker got a tip about Mercedes and her identity as a woman. She is responsible for keeping the case alive and fighting for justice for Mercedes.

Related: Watch Real Lives, Real Stories, & Real Celebrities on Reelz Channel via Amazon Channels!

Mercedes best friend refers Mercedes as Michael throughout the show, even sharing how close Michael and Josh were, the amount of sex they had, etc., blowing the trans panic theory out of the water.

It also adds to the confusion. Why does she insist on calling Mercedes Micheal?

Baker discovers the tie to The Latin Kings gang Josh belongs to puts him into jeopardy. The gang is against homosexuality and could be why Josh uses the transphobia defense even if he knew earlier that Mercedes was transsexual.

Loving Mercedes never comes into question. Everyone involved with the case, including Josh, agrees that Josh loved Mercedes.

It seems a perfect example of a case for a show titled Love & Hate Crime.

Its also evident Josh is struggling with his sexuality and when faced with being outed (and killed), he murders the woman he loves to save his own skin.

Related: How to Get Away with Murder Round Table: Who Will Die Next?!

In theory, Josh kills Mercedes for being transsexual. But does he kill her because he hates that she is transsexual? No. Its later revealed he always knew she was transsexual. He killed her because he was going to be killed.

In the eyes of the law, though, the circumstances surrounding the murder qualify as a hate crime no matter the reason.

Josh made a series of decisions in his life that found him torn in several different directions, and none of them allowed him an easy way out. He was ultimately ensnared in a cage of his own making.

Seventeen-year-old girl Mercedes couldnt possibly understand what was happening with a 28-year-old man, and she lost her life because of it.

And if this topic seems difficult to grasp, many will be equally challenged when theyre faced with the murder of James Craig Anderson on Part Two of Love & Hate Crime.

Watch and judge for yourself.

"SOUTH WINDSOR/VERNON, CT — A self-proclaimed pita bread tycoon who hailed from Vernon and ran a financing scheme out of a South Windsor business entity has entered a plea in a six-year-old fraud case, a leading prosecutor said. Deirdre Daly, United States attorney for the District of Connecticut, announced Thursday that Moshen Youssef, 27, formerly of Vernon, had entered a guilty before U.S. District Judge Janet Bond Arterton in New Haven to fraud offenses relating to a scheme to secure more than $3 million in funding for his purported pita manufacturing business. According to court documents and statements made in court, beginning in approximately October 2011, Youssef defrauded various banks, a corporate leasing and vendor finance company, and the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development, in a scheme to secure funding for equipment purchases for his company, Amoun Pita and Distribution LLC and other companies he controlled. According to its business plan, Amoun Pita was a bakery that manufactured pocket pita bread from a production facility in South Windsor. As part of the scheme, Youssef provided false information when applying for loans, lines of credit, lease financing and state grants, purportedly to finance the acquisition of new pita manufacturing equipment, other machinery and inventory related to his businesses, Daly said. The false information included documentation that inflated the assets and income of Youssef and his companies, Daly said. Fraudulent invoices were created purporting to document equipment purchases that, in fact, never occurred, she added. Youssef created marketing materials and websites for non-existent vendors to back up the claims, Daly said. Youssef s scheme resulted in more than $3 million in losses, Daly said. He entered a plea of guilty to one count of bank fraud, which carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 30 years, and one count of mail fraud, which carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years, Daly said. Youssef agreed to pay the lenders restitution in the amount of $3,209,603.17, Daly said. Judge Arterton scheduled sentencing for Jan. 18, 2018. Youssef, who has dual U.S and Egyptian citizenship, moved to Canada in 2014, case records show. On Oct 22, 2015, a grand jury returned a 14-count indictment charging him with various fraud offenses. He was arrested in Canada on March 1 of this year and has been detained since his arrest, Daly said. The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, with the assistance of the Quebec Provincial Police RELEX Unit, Montreal Police Service and Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

"A Goshen man is beaten and stabbed in an apparent hate crime Video

A Goshen man is in the hospital after being beaten and stabbed over the weekend in what Tulare County officials called a hate crime.

The attack happened Sunday around 4 pm on the 7000 block of avenue 310, in Goshen.

The victims identity has not been released but his niece said she witnessed it all unfold.

An argument broke out, I was inside the house and I hear my uncle yelling for help so I come outside, said the victims niece.

She said two men were yelling at her uncle as he sat in his car just outside the home.

Before you know it, it just escalated into them jumping on him and stabbing him, she said.

The Tulare County Sheriffs Office said 25 year-old Jonathan Kennedy and 39 year-old Jodan Peck, both nearby neighbors, were identified as the attackers.

They were making racial slurs and after it happened they just kept saying thats what he gets, said the victims niece.

She said Peck and Kennedy continued their racist rant while threatening her family.

Deputies arrived to find her 60-year old uncle stabbed multiple times.

He has a punctured lung and a lacerated kidney as well as other critical wounds, she said.

Her uncle was taken to the hospital in Fresno and is now in stable condition.

The Tulare County District Attorneys office is investigating.

These individuals are facing life sentences, both of them, said David Alavezos, Assistant District Attorney of Tulare County.

He said the two men are charged with a hate crime, causing bodily injury and attempted murder.

There are imperfect people in every community. There are hateful people in every community, said Alavezos.

Kennedy has priors, but its unclear if either men have racially motivated crimes in their past.

The victims niece said shes afraid of retaliation.

Things have been getting worse with the racism. People think its okay and I dont think its fair, and Im afraid for my daughter to grow up in this world as bad as its getting.

The district attorneys office said a preliminary hearing for the two men will likely take place within the next two weeks.",1

"It took a Palm Beach County jury less than four hours of deliberations to reject a 22-year-old man’s self-defense claims in the April 2015 Jupiter murder of Guatemalan teen Onesimo Marcelino Lopez-Ramos.

With their guilty verdict, jurors found that David Harris committed a hate crime during the fight that led to the death of 18-year-old Lopez-Ramos near a home in the 300 block of Fourth Street, where he and relatives were listening to music.

Circuit Judge Samantha Schosberg Feuer immediately sentenced Harris to life in prison, the mandatory punishment under the law. But the judge also added a consecutive 15 years in prison for a related aggravated battery charge while committing evidence of prejudice in connection with Harris’ admitted beating of one of Lopez-Ramos’ relatives, Elmer Lopez.

Feuer, in sentencing Harris, called his actions “heinous and horrific.” Harris told police at the time of his arrest that he, his younger brother Jesse, their friend Austin Taggart and others had decided that night to go “Guat hunting.”

The term, used to describe the targeting of immigrants from Guatemala and other South and Central American nations for robberies and beatings, became pivotal in a crime prosecutors say had clear racial overtones.

“We’re extremely pleased at this outcome for the victim’s family,” Assistant State Attorney Jill Richstone, who prosecuted the case with Assistant State Attorney Marci Rex, said after the verdict.

Richstone and Rex declined to comment further, citing the still open cases against Taggart and Jesse Harris, who are awaiting trial.

Jurors had deliberated the case for an hour Monday without a verdict. They were in the third hour of deciding the case Tuesday when they asked for transcripts of statements Harris gave to Jupiter police.

Feuer explained to them that there were no transcripts, but they could listen to the statements again in open court. The statements, Feuer told them, were 2 1/2 hours long.

The judge sent jurors back to the deliberation room to decide whether they wanted to listen to the recordings. Less than five minutes later, the 12 panelists sent a note to Feuer saying they had a verdict.

Defense attorney Franklin Prince said he initially thought that was a good sign for Harris. He had argued that it was Taggart who killed Lopez-Ramos, and Taggart alone who made a reference to “Guat hunting.”

A manslaughter conviction would have capped Harris’ conviction at 15 years. Instead, on his son’s third birthday, Harris received a life sentence.

“If they had come back without asking to listen to the statement, then it would have been different,” Prince said, adding that the guilty verdict surprised him. “Obviously we are disappointed, but we respect the jury’s decision.”

Prince said Harris will appeal the verdict.

Earlier this year, Feuer denied Harris’ request to declare him immune from prosecution by arguing he was acting in self-defense under what is commonly known as Florida’s “stand your ground” law.

Harris reiterated his self-defense claims when he took the stand in his own defense Monday, saying that he swung an ax at Lopez-Ramos just once so that he could give his little brother a chance to escape the fight. Though Harris tried to distance himself from Taggart on the witness stand, Richstone reminded jurors of Harris’ words to police.

“Remember what he told them? ‘We were brothers in arms!’ ” Richstone said.

Harris insisted he was trying to protect his younger brother in explaining his confession to Jupiter police detectives. He claimed he told them that he was responsible for Lopez-Ramos’ death because they threatened to charge his brother with the crime. Harris said that although he struck Lopez-Ramos with an ax, it was the subsequent blows that Taggart inflicted with a rock that killed the teen.

In a statement after the verdict, Jupiter police officials celebrated Harris conviction.

“I hope this guilty verdict brings some small closure to the loved ones of Onesimo Marcelino Lopez- Ramos after the horrific tragedy this family has endured,” said Chief Frank Kitzerow.",1

"The idea of an interracial relationship so angered two Florida men that when a black man began regularly visiting a white woman who lived on their block they burned a cross in the couple’s front yard—and on Tuesday both racists were sentenced to prison for the hate crime.

Thomas Sigler was sentenced to almost three years in federal prison, while William Dennis will spend just under two years behind bars, a federal judge decided. Both pleaded guilty to a series of events that began in April 2012, when a white woman identified in court papers as K.L. rented a house on their block in Port Richey, Florida.

The woman was dating a black man, identified as D.M., who lived nearby and frequently visited her. Dennis didn’t like that: He and another neighbor, Thomas Sigler III, would yell racial slurs at D.M. when he was walking on Seward Drive. Several witnesses told investigators that Dennis and Sigler openly discussed their anger about D.M. being on Seward Drive, and described their hatred of him as “an obsession.”

“The victims were attacked and threatened in their own neighborhood and home because of their race,” John M. Gore, acting assistant attorney for civil rights, said in a statement. “Such violence and intimidation has no place in our society. The Justice Department is committed to protecting the rights of all citizens, and will continue to vigorously prosecute individuals who commit such atrocious acts of hate.”

While Sigler and Dennis were indicted well before President Trump appointed U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Alabaman headed the Department of Justice by the time the two men pleaded guilty this spring. Civil rights groups had worried Sessions would put hate crime laws on the back burner, Politico has reported, but he has promised to aggressively prosecute such attacks.

“I know the responsibility that we have, and we have a responsibility to protect people’s freedom, their religious rights, their integrity, their ability to express themselves, to push back against violence and hate crimes that occur in our country,” Sessions told federal prosecutors at a hate crimes summit in Washington in June. “So, we’re going to do that, I will assure you, in every way.”",1
"NEW HAVEN, CT — Police have confirmed that the body found in East Rock Park Friday morning belonged to missing Hamden man Emanuel Ramos, 37, who was last seen Nov. 8 at the park. Ramos suffered from Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia and his parents indicated he hasnt been taking his medication. Ramos fled from his fathers car while at the parks summit.

"A 10-year-old boy died of suspicious circumstances last week and The Los Angeles County Department of Child and Family Services says they were aware of alleged abuse prior to his death. They also revealed that he “liked boys” in a statement.

Young Anthony Avalos died from what his mother said was a fall in his Lancaster Calif. home. The Advocate reports that his body was covered in cigarette burns and according to councilors, teachers, and family members, his six siblings were also being abused.

He had a severe head injury consistent with a brain bleed, plus bruises and abrasions all about his body, said DCFS Director Bobby Cagle.  All that indicates to me that thats non-accidental.

As to whether homophobia played a part in Anthonys death is yet to be determined as investigators try and piece together what happened.

His aunt, Maria Barron, says she repeatedly told authorities about the abuse the children faced in the home both from the mother Heather Barron and her boyfriend Kareem Leiva who was convicted of domestic abuse back in 2010.

Barron says the kids faced beatings, sexual abuse, being locked in small spaces, and deprivation of food and water.

There are still no answers as to the reason why the children were allowed to stay in the home even after multiple calls to the DCFS, but Cagle says its too early to tell if the welfare system failed them.

Anthonys aunt said her nephew was courageous and his coming out, only reinforces how brave Anthony was, she told the Times.

A similar case in Southern California involving 8-year-old Gabriel Fernandez happened five years ago when his mother and her boyfriend tortured him because they thought he was gay.",1
"A rash of deadly deer encounters on East Lake Road has local activists calling for change. Despite the recent addition of Deer Crossing signs in the area, deer and vehicles are still colliding at a pace that has some residents worried about safety. Evidence of the deadly encounters is often visible on the busy road. Theres a lot of blood on the road. You drive on the road and you see all the blood and it doesnt speak well for our community, said Barb Walker, an East Lake resident and mother of two children. Walker is also a volunteer with the Audubon Society and blogs on Patch. In addition to helping rescue injured birds in the area, she keeps an informal count of deer that are killed on the road. According to her tally, six deer were hit and killed in the East Lake area the past week. Its a situation thats difficult for everyone, from the Pinellas County Sheriffs Deputies who call trappers to shoot and kill the suffering deer -or in some instances shoot the animals themselves- to the drivers who hit the deer. Walker says her husband was once two hours late to work because he stopped to help someone who hit a deer. He wound up staying to console the person, who was very upset. People who hit deer, theyre victims too. Its traumatic, she said. Why the Recent Increase? Deer are often hit this time of year, because theyre more active during their breeding season which is from October through January. Pinellas County Sheriffs Deputies responded to two accidents on East Lake Rd. last week involving deer. Two deer were hit Dec. 14 by a car near Sandy Point Rd., which is just north of John Chesnut Sr. Park, where many deer feed. Both injured deer were shot and killed by a trapper. Another deer was hit Dec. 16 near Boot Ranch Rd. That deer was also euthanized by a trapper. The Florida Highway Patrol responded to two recent accidents involving deer on East Lake Rd. One crash was around 1 a.m. on Oct. 31 near Boot Ranch Rd. A deer ran across the road and into the path of a Hyundai Elantra, causing an estimated $4,000 damage. The most recent crash was around 6:30 a.m. Dec. 11 near the intersection of Tarpon Woods Blvd. A deer ran into the path of a Ford Mustang, causing an estimated $2,000 damage to the car. In both crashes the deer were killed. Main Cause Florida Fish and Wildlife Spokesperson Gary Morse says the deadly encounters are a result of habitat fragmentation, a term used to describe situations when wildlifes habitat is divided by something like a road, a river or homes. He says the situation threatens wildlife who must still try to reproduce and find food, despite obstacles like East Lake Rd. Morse says Florida Fish and Wildlife Officers have had to shoot injured deer whove been hit by cars to end the deers suffering. He says deer are very hard to rehabilitate after theyve been injured. They often die from stress. Vernon Yates, who operates Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation in Seminole agrees. He rehabilitates deer that are not too badly injured. Yates says deputies often call him after a deer has been hit. We take in a lot of deer, he said. If rehabilitating a deer is not possible and the deer are euthanized, Yates uses them as meat for the tigers and other big cats that he has at his rescue facility. Possible Solutions Finding a solution to the dangerous deer encounters is difficult, according to Morse. Fencing would just aggravate habitat fragmentation. Dropping birth control pellets to try to control the deer population interferes with natural order. He says hunting in certain areas has helped keep the deer population down, but this might not be realistic in a suburban area thats home to more than 30,000 people. Barb Walker thinks in order to solve the problem, leaders must get advice from multiple experts who have experience dealing with this type of situation. I dont think theres any single solution, she said. We need to use our brains before our brawn, she added, referring to the deer shootings. We need a better procedure in place and we need some public education. Council of North County Neighborhoods (CNCN) President Don Ewing says East Lakes deer problems are on his organizations radar. Its going to be one of the top priorities for 2013, he said. Whats next? The issue will be discussed at CNCNs meeting on January 21. The meeting location has not been determined. As soon as it is announced, we will pass that information along. Related- Blogs by Barb Walker-",0

"Police are investigating the racially-charged incident as a hate crime

A University of Hartford student is accused of tormenting her college roommate for weeks—even going so far as to rub bloody tampons all over her backpack.

The Hartford Courant reported that Brianna Rae Brochu, who is white, is facing a hate crime for the alleged ongoing harassment of Jazzy Rowe, her black roommate.

In a video posted to Facebook, Rowe claimed that Brochu, 18, went online to brag about the alleged acts she committed after Rowe said she was moving out.

Rowe noted that she was having throat pain for the month she lived with Brochu. After announcing that she was changing rooms on October 17, Rowe recalled seeing Brochu texting on her phone. Minutes later, two resident assistants alerted her to some unsettling claims Brochu made on social media.

“Finally did it yo girl got rid of her roommate!,” Brochu allegedly boasted on Instagram, according to the Miami Herald.

“After 1 1/2 months of spitting in her coconut oil, putting moldy clam dip in her lotions, rubbing used tampons on her backpack, putting her toothbrush where the sun doesn’t shine and so much more I can finally say goodbye to Jamaican Barbie.”

This is your student Briana Brochu bragging about the vile things she did to her roommate @UofHartford #JusticeForJazzy pic.twitter.com/q44dDbEDTB — ? ArtsyBamaGirl (@BamaIntrovert) November 1, 2017

Rowe claimed that she noticed her bag, that she keeps near her bed, was bloodstained. She said that the school’s Public Safety unit took the bag as it posed a health hazard.

Brochu was arrested on Saturday after reportedly admitting to police that she put her bodily fluids on Rowe’s backpack and licked her utensils. Authorities announced Wednesday that they’re adding an intimidation based on bigotry or bias charge to Brochu’s breach of peace and criminal mischief case, the Courant reported.

In the video, Rowe expressed frustration with university officials for telling her that she would be removed from student housing if she spoke about the situation. Calling attention to a race dynamic, Rowe said she was also distressed that it took so long for Brochu to be punished.

“If the race roles were reversed, I feel like this would have gone down a different route,” she said in the hourlong video.

However, the University of Hartford announced Wednesday that Brochu is no longer a student at the college.

“As of this morning, Brianna Brochu is no longer a student at the University of Hartford,” said the school’s president, Gregory S. Woodward. “She will not be returning to the institution.”

An update from President Woodward. As of this morning, Brianna Brochu is no longer a student at #UHart. https://t.co/xBdADhYSDn — U of Hartford Alumni (@UHartfordAlumni) November 1, 2017

Brochu is scheduled to appear in court on November 15.

MILWAUKEE -- More than two months after a Muslim woman was attacked on Milwaukees south side, police say there is no reason to believe she was targeted due to her faith, and theres no evidence of a hate crime. However, religious leaders arent convinced.

New police reports indicate the victim herself said it wasnt her faith, but her family that might be to blame for an attack that left her bruised and bloodied.

On Tuesday, June 27th, her attorney said the victim is appalled by the police report, saying an interpreter got things wrong.

It was an alleged attack involving an elderly Muslim woman.

I said I am going to die today for sure! the victim said.

In early April, as she walked home from morning prayer near 13th and Layton, she was beaten and kicked.

Then he bit me like animal, the victim said.

With blood-stained clothes, but nothing taken, members of her congregation at the Islamic Society of Milwaukee held a press conference days later.

All the evidence appears to indicate it was a hate crime, religious leaders said.

Religious and community leaders urged police to investigate the attack as a hate crime. But the new documents appear to show the crime may have had nothing to do with the womans religion at all.

Police reports obtained by the website The Daily Caller show the victim told police in April she does not believe this was a random attack, and instead may be related to her estranged daughter. The woman told police her daughter had divorced, alienated her family and began a relationship with a woman. While she had no proof her daughters girlfriend was responsible, she told police this type of attack would be an example of the intimidation (the girlfriend) would use to keep people out of her daughters life.

On Tuesday, in a statement, Milwaukee police said: After a thorough and complete investigation, there is no evidence this is a hate crime.

The womans attorney said not so fast!

She stated unequivocally that she didnt say that. She told me that she felt that the person who translated for her inserted that translators opinion about what may or may not be the issue, Munjeb Ahmad said.

Ahmad said his client is adamant the police report is inaccurate. Its different from the story the woman told FOX6 News herself.

For example, the police report says the victim said: The man who attacked her did not try to take her hajib. Thats not what she told FOX6.

I told him to fight him. I said dont take my hijab, the woman said.

Ahmad said shes convinced her family had no role in the attack.

Shes been unequivocal that she thinks this is a hate crime, and as I said, she never, at one point, thought that any of her family issues had anything to do with this attack, Ahmad said.

FOX6 News wanted to ask the woman some questions in an effort to clear this up. We could get the chance later this week. Officials with the Islamic Society said they dont regret that press conference, and theyve said from the beginning they hope this isnt a hate crime, but that its investigated as one, so nothing is missed.",1

Special to the Trice Edney News Wire from ProPublica

In violation of a long-standing legal mandate, scores of federal law enforcement agencies are failing to submit statistics to the FBI’s national hate crimes database, ProPublica has learned.

The lack of participation by federal law enforcement represents a significant and largely unknown flaw in the database, which is supposed to be the nation’s most comprehensive source of information on hate crimes. The database is maintained by the FBI’s Criminal Justice Information Services Division, which uses it to tabulate the number of alleged hate crimes occurring around the nation each year.

The FBI has identified at least 120 federal agencies that aren’t uploading information to the database, according to Amy Blasher, a unit chief at the CJIS division, an arm of the bureau that is overseeing the modernization of its information systems.

The federal government operates a vast array of law enforcement agencies — ranging from Customs and Border Protection to the Drug Enforcement Administration to the Amtrak Police — employing more than 120,000 law enforcement officers with arrest powers. The FBI would not say which agencies have declined to participate in the program, but the bureau’s annual tally of hate crimes statistics does not include any offenses handled by federal law enforcement. Indeed, the problem is so widespread that the FBI itself isn’t submitting the hate crimes it investigates to its own database.

“We truly don’t understand what’s happening with crime in the U.S. without the federal component,” Ms. Blasher said in an interview.

At present, the bulk of the information in the database is supplied by state and local police departments. In 2015, the database tracked more than 5,580 alleged hate crime incidents, including 257 targeting Muslims, an upward surge of 67 percent from the previous year. (The bureau hasn’t released 2016 or 2017 statistics yet.)

But it has long been clear that hundreds of local police departments don’t send data to the FBI, and so given the added lack of participation by federal law enforcement, the true numbers for 2015 are likely to be significantly higher.

A federal law, the 1988 Uniform Federal Crime Reporting Act, requires all U.S. government law enforcement agencies to send a wide variety of crime data to the FBI. Two years later, after the passage of another law, the bureau began collecting data about “crimes that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity.” That was later expanded to include gender and gender identity.

The federal agencies that are not submitting data are violating the law, Ms. Blasher said. She said she is in contact with about 20 agencies and is hopeful that some will start participating, but added that there is no firm timeline for that to happen.

“Honestly, we don’t know how long it will take,” she said of the effort to get federal agencies on board.

The issue goes far beyond hate crimes. Federal agencies are failing to report a whole range of crime statistics, Ms. Blasher conceded. But hate crimes, and the lack of reliable data concerning them, have been of intense interest amid the country’s highly polarized and volatile political environment.

ProPublica contacted several federal agencies seeking an explanation. A spokesperson for the Army’s Criminal Investigation Command, which handles close to 50,000 offenses annually, said the service is adhering to Defense Department rules regarding crime data and is using a digital crime tracking system linked to the FBI’s database.

But Army officials declined to say whether its statistics are actually being sent to the FBI, referring that question up the chain of command to the Department of Defense.

In 2014, an internal probe conducted by Defense Department investigators found that the “DoD is not reporting criminal incident data to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for inclusion in the annual Uniform Crime Reports.”

ProPublica contacted the Defense Department for clarification, and shared with a department spokesman a copy of the 2014 reports acknowledging the failure to send data to the FBI.

“We have no additional information at this time,” said Christopher Sherwood, the spokesman.",1
"The Farmington Police Department along with dozens of other law enforcement agencies throughout the state are participating it the U Drive. U Text. U Pay campaign to crackdown on distracted driving. The effort is part of a large campaign sponsored by the National Traffic Safety Administration. Driving and texting is illegal and irresponsible. People who break our States texting law will be stopped and fined. If you drive and text, you will pay, said Sgt. Jason Raines. For those who say that driving and texting is an epidemic, we believe enforcement of our hand-held mobile phone ban law is part of the cure. Under Connecticuts cell phone and texting law, violations involve heavy fines, ranging from $150 for a first offense, $300 for a second violation, and $500 for each subsequent violation. More from Farmington Police: As many as 50 law enforcement agencies including state and local police will take part in the mobilization to enforce Connecticuts tough law that prohibits motorists from texting and/or using hand-held cell phones while driving. The crackdown will span the entire month of April. During a similar, three week campaign last September, over 7,000 motorists received a citation for using their phone while driving. In 2013, 3,154 people were killed and an estimated additional 424,000 were injured in motor vehicle crashes involving distracted drivers. According to a 2014 special article in the New England Journal of Medicine, the risk of a crash or near-crash among novice drivers increased with the performance of many secondary tasks, including texting and dialing cell phones. Police will be keeping an especially close eye out for drivers who text and drive. Texting and driving requires motorists to take their eyes off the road, hands off the wheel, and mind off the task of driving. It creates the proverbial perfect storm for a crash, and no one has the right to put another persons life at risk like that, said Sgt. Jason Raines. Connecticut remains the only state in the nation to receive special distracted driving prevention funds – the same funds that allow for special patrols to identify, stop and cite drivers who choose to ignore distracted driving laws. Over $4.6 million dollars has been awarded to the state over the last two years specifically – to fund campaigns like this one. Connecticut qualifies for this federal funding source through a mix of tough laws – and, a proven track record in strong enforcement of distracted driving laws. Its not that complicated: if you text and drive, we will see you, pull you over, and fine you. Were serious about enforcing texting laws, said Sgt. Jason Raines.

"SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO - Police arrested a man Monday morning in South San Francisco after he got into an altercation with his ex-girlfriend, grabbed her purse and stole money. At 11:06 a.m., a woman told police that she was robbed in the 100 block of Hickey Boulevard, according to police. The victim said her ex-boyfriend forcibly stole her purse and removed $100 in cash, before fleeing the scene. Officers contacted the suspect, identified as 27-year-old Jesse Armstead of San Francisco. Armstead however refused to cooperate and officers detained him, police said. During a search of his belongings, officers found three identification cards belonging to a South San Francisco resident. Armstead was arrested on suspicion of robbery, resisting arrest, and misappropriation of lost property, according to police. He has been booked into the San Mateo County Jail, police said. --Bay City News; Photo by Renee Schiavone, Patch",0
"After Michael Jones, 35, of Mount Vernon, N.Y., died this week of head injuries, initial reports raised the possibility that his death was an antigay hate crime — but now police are downplaying that theory.

Jones, known to friends and family as “Chris,” died Tuesday evening, shortly after he was found on a street in the New York City suburb suffering from severe head injuries, reports The Journal News, an area newspaper. Mount Vernon Mayor Richard Thomas issued a press release Thursday morning saying “preliminary reports” indicated Jones “was in an altercation and fell or was pushed, possibly striking his head on a curb.” In the release, acting Police Commissioner Shawn Harris said Jones’s death appeared to have resulted from “a deeply personal conflict that may be a hate crime.”

Police did not specify what type of hate crime. Sources told New York City TV station WCBS that Jones was gay, but his cousin Laurie Hemphill said he was not. There were also reports that he was bullied in his neighborhood, but Hemphill told journalists, “All the kids around here loved him.”

At a Thursday afternoon press conference, Harris did not include the hate-crime angle in his prepared remarks. “Harris said police had not yet received a cause of death from the Westchester Medical Examiner’s Office and could not rule out the possibility that no crime occurred,” The Journal News reports.

Police are searching for two men who were seen with Jones shortly before his death. They’re asking for witnesses to come forward and for nearby businesses to see if their surveillance cameras captured Jones’s interaction with the men.",1
"Middletown, NJ - A fire broke out while a family was having breakfast Sunday morning in a home in the Belford section of Middletown Township. Volunteer firefighters responded to the home at 6 Crab Apple Lane at 9:05 a.m. Sunday. The residents were on the first floor having breakfast when they heard the smoke alarm go off upstairs, Middletown Township Fire Department Public Information Officer Dennis Fowler said. A resident went up to check, saw the fire and immediately called 911 after the family ran out of the home. The first arriving units on the scene reported a heavy fire and smoke coming from the roof. 700 feet of supply line was dropped to the nearest hydrant, and firefighters were able to contain the fire primarily to the attic area and the attic entrance on the second floor. They used tarps to prevent water from damaging the rest of the home. The fire was declared under control by 9:24 a.m., with the last units clearing the scene by 11 a.m. There was one reported injury: a firefighter tripped at the scene. The exact cause of the fire is being investigated by the Middletown Township Fire Marshalls office. Holmdel First Aid Squad provided their drone to take photos from an aerial view of the attic and roof as part of the investigation. Leonardo, Port Monmouth, Keansburg Little Silver and Holmdel First Aid Squads provided EMS, under the guidance of Middletown EMS Chief Robert Pfleger II. Approximately 65 firefighters from 4 companies of the Middletown Township Fire Department (Belford Engine, Community, East Keansburg, Belford Independent Fire Companies), under the command of Department Chief John Gorsegner, responded to the scene.",0
"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Jurors have convicted a Florida man in a hate-crime case of a Guatemalan man who was fatally beaten outside his home.

After the jury returned the first-degree murder verdict on Tuesday, Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Samantha Schosberg Feuer sentenced 22-year-old David Harris to life in prison.

Prosecutors said Harris joined two other men in an attack on 18-year-old Onesimo Marcelino Lopez-Ramos, adding that they prowled the streets that night in 2015 looking to rob someone of Guatemalan heritage.

"Federal hate crime charges were filed Wednesday against a man accused of plowing a car into a crowd of people protesting a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing a woman and injuring dozens more.

The Department of Justice announced that an indictment returned Wednesday charges 21-year-old James Alex Fields Jr. of Maumee, Ohio, with 30 crimes, including one count of a hate crime resulting in the death of Heather Heyer, and 28 other hate crimes involving an attempt to kill other people who were injured.

Last summers violence in Charlottesville cut short a promising young life and shocked the nation, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. Todays indictment should send a clear message to every would-be criminal in America that we aggressively prosecute violent crimes of hate that threaten the core principles of our nation.

Authorities have said that Fields, described by a former teacher as having a keen interest in Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler, drove his speeding car into a group of people demonstrating against the Unite the Right rally that drew hundreds of white nationalists to the college town, where officials planned to remove a Confederate monument.

Car Plows Into Crowd After Charlottesville Alt-Right Rally

One person died and more than a dozen were injured when a car slammed into a crowd after a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. News4s Derrick Ward reports from Charlottesville. (Published Saturday, Aug. 12, 2017)

The attack came after the rally had descended into chaos — with violent brawling between attendees and counterdemonstrators — and authorities had forced the crowd to disband. Fields had been photographed hours beforehand with a shield bearing the emblem of Vanguard America, one of the hate groups that took part, although the group denied any association with him.

Fields already faces state charges including first-degree murder. He has been in custody since the rally.

"The former University of Hartford student accused of harassing her Black roommate by smearing used tampons over her belongings avoided a hate crime charge on Monday.

Brianna Brochu, 18, who is white, appeared in Hartford Superior Court but did not comment as she left the courthouse. She pleaded not guilty to the charges of criminal mischief and breach of peace.

Civil rights advocates called for Brochu to face hate crimes charges in addition to the other charges. However, the court decided not to pursue those additional charges, drawing condemnation from activist groups.

“She should be charged with a hate crime,” NAACP Greater Hartford Branch President Imam Abdul-Shahid Muhammad Ansari told NBC News. “We made our feelings known and will continue to do so, letting the community know and elected officials know as well.”

‘Jamaican Barbie’

Brochu allegedly called her Black roommate Chennel “Jazzy” Rowe “Jamaican Barbie” and embarked on a long-running campaign to get rid of her roommate by a series of disgusting behaviors, including putting Rowe’s toothbrush up her rectum.

Rowe said in a Facebook video that she and her roommate had a rocky relationship. For example, Brochu would come in and turn off the lights if Rowe was working. However, it wasn’t until she started “getting sick” that things came to a head.

“It started with throat pain,” she explained. “I thought maybe because it’s colder up here, I’m just catching a cold. After a month it got to the point where I had extreme throat pain that I couldn’t sleep, to the point where I couldn’t speak.”

However, it wasn’t until Rowe finally moved out that she realized what her roommate had done, when she saw this post from Brochu on her Instagram: “Finally did it yo girl got rid of her roommate!! After 1 1/12 month of spitting in her coconut oil, putting moldy clam dip in her lotions, rubbing used tampons on her backpack, putting her toothbrush places where the sun doesn’t shine and so much more I can finally say goodbye Jamaican Barbie.”

Prosecutors say they are still investigating the case.",1

"CONTRA COSTA COUNTY, CA — Two Texas men have been sentenced to three years in state prison after they pleaded no contest Thursday to felony assault and a hate crime enhancement for a 2016 attack in Richmond, according to Contra Costa County District Attorney Mark Peterson.

Chase Little and Colton Leblanc were accused of attacking Maan Singh Khalsa, a Richmond resident and observer of the Sikh faith, prosecutors said.

On Sept. 25, Khalsa was stopped at a red light at Hilltop Road, dressed in traditional Sikh clothes and on his way to a religious ceremony when Little and Leblanc started throwing beer cans at his vehicle, prosecutors said.

The two men then exited their pickup truck, repeatedly punched the victim in the face, removed his turban and cut his unshorn hair, a sacred article of his faith, prosecutors said.

During the assault, Khalsa suffered a swollen black eye, damaged teeth and several knife wounds to his left hand.

One of the wounds required stitches, and due to an infection from the knife wound, Khalsas pinky finger had to be amputated.

"SONOMA COUNTY, CA -- A Napa County man was arrested Friday as the suspect in a Sonoma bank robbery that occurred Tuesday, according to the Sonoma County Sheriffs Office. Mohammad Juma Kharufeh, 38, of American Canyon, was booked into the main Sonoma County jail on suspicion of felony robbery and felony burglary in the heist at Rabobank on Maple Street. The sheriffs office announced Kharufehs arrest in a Facebook post Friday night that included a photo of him being handcuffed and a photo of a gray Subaru station wagon that appeared to match a surveillance image obtained by detectives of the bank robbery suspects car. Jail records Saturday showed Kharufeh was being held on $60,000 bail and was due in court at 1:30 p.m. Tuesday. Kharufeh turned himself in Friday at the Sonoma Police Station, The Press-Democrat reported. In the robberythat occurred just after noon on Tuesday, a man who was wearing a mesh mask over his face entered the bank and demanded cash from a teller while simulating holding a gun, Sonoma sheriffs officials said. The man ran out of the bank after the teller gave the man an undisclosed amount of cash, officials said. Tuesday afternoon, the sheriffs office shared surveillance images obtained from a nearby market that showed a man wearing the same clothes as the alleged robber, along with a Subaru station wagon believed to be the suspects vehicle.

"There is an inexcusable and disheartening silence from White Evangelical Christians over the unprovoked killing of Richard Collins III, at the University of Maryland. Collins, age 23, was a member of the ROTC. He was recently commissioned as a second Lieutenant in the army, and scheduled to graduate from Bowie State University. His father, a military veteran, said his son loved lacrosse, soccer and was a runner. Collins was African American. His killer, age 22, was white nationalist, Sean Christopher Urbanski, a University of Maryland student, charged with murder and assault for the attack that University of Maryland Police Chief David Mitchell called “totally unprovoked.” Urbanski is a member of a Facebook group called Alt-Reich Nation.

Since hearing the news, I have anguished over one question: “Why did White Evangelical silence over this unprovoked attack by this White man on the Black man bother me so much?” Certainly racial attacks against African Americans by White Americans is not a new phenomenon.

White Evangelical Christian silence can only be read as consent.

My answer came in reading the response of the judge where the attacker was held without bond. “He is an absolute danger to the community,” she said. I believe that the real “danger to the community” about which the judge spoke, did not just apply to the killer. It applies, as well, to White Evangelical Christians, professing a faith rooted in justice for the oppressed, but whose silence over America’s “open season” on Black lives, can only be read as consent.

Perhaps this silence comes from the fact that the killer was a white nationalist. Maybe the excuse here for silence comes from a mindset that says, “I’m not a white nationalist. I would never kill a Black person just for the color of their skin, so this killing is not about me.”

Tragically, the same excuse was made by White Evangelicals each time a Black person, mostly unarmed men and boys, were murdered by killer cops. Sadly, we have heard these names and too many others: Jordan Edwards, Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Jordan Davis, Eric Garner, Alton Sterling, Laquan McDonald, Walter Scott. The list goes on of those struck down by police with impunity.

Repeatedly, Black community pain, outrage and resistance over these escalating killings have been met by the silence of the White evangelical community. These killings have taken place mostly without a word, even from often outspoken White Evangelicals. Perhaps something about the victims made them unworthy of compassion, outrage, or speaking out. They had a police record. They were selling untaxed cigarettes. They had a busted taillight. They were reported to have had a weapon. They resisted arrest. They were running from the police. The excuses are varied, but no less painful.

The Biblical call to protect and cover the weakest parts of the body makes silence an inexcusable response to the escalating attacks on Black lives.

The Collins murder reminds us that whether or not an African American is an upstanding citizen, doing all the right things, or has a flawed background, their killing is sill met with the same silence; not the least bit of outrage. Richard Collins III was a soldier, an honor student; just three days short of graduating from college. He did not have a police record. Not even these extraordinary attributes and accomplishments were enough to provoke Christ-like compassion and outrage from White Evangelicals. His life did not matter to them, any more than those who were considered too imperfect to illicit any measure of moral indignation.

I view this silence in the face of oppression of a fellow African American citizen especially troubling from a biblical viewpoint. First, every person born is created in the image of God (imago dei) and is, therefore, worthy of equal dignity, respect, and honor. Second, those who profess to have placed their faith in Jesus as Lord of their lives are called to “bear one another’s burdens.” Census reports affirm that African Americans are more likely to be stopped, frisked, arrested, and abused by the police than White citizens, even for the same crimes. Therefore, the Biblical call to protect and cover the weakest parts of the body is a call that makes silence an inexcusable and troubling response to the escalating attacks on Black lives.",1

"Jackson Sugrue, 19, of Framingham, Massachusetts is being charged with a hate crime after allegedly holding another man hostage for four days, beating and starving him.

Sugrue is accused of keeping the 50-year-old victim, Otoni Eliseu, against his will because he is gay, calling him homophobic slurs.

“He attacked me on my back, on my butt, [saying] ‘you’re gay, you like me’,” Eliseu reportedly said, according to Boston 25.

Dylan Krasinski, the prosecutor in the case bolsters that claim, “He kept saying it over and over. The victim believes this is what led to the assault.

Eliseu was able to escape this past Saturday after reportedly spending two weeks with the accused, both men allegedly smoking crack. Then on Wednesday, June 27, Sugrue became violent, striking the victim with a coffee table.

These actions resulted in Sugrue not only being charged with a hate crime, but assault and battery, and intimidation of a witness.

His attorney, Kenneth Gross, asserts that it is actually Sugrue who is the victim and the older gentleman was trying to entice my client to do things that were against his nature.”

Sugrues parents agree. “My son is a victim of a 50-year-old man,” said his mother Terry Sugrue who also claims that the alleged victim had an obsession with her son.

His father added, “It’s absolutely ridiculous to suggest my son would have anything to do with a hate crime.”

A restraining order has been issued and Sugrue is due back in court on Aug. 1 for a pretrial conference.",1
"Kansas City, KS - The man already convicted of murder for the Austins Bar & Grill shooting in Olathe in February 2017 pled guilty to all federal hate crime charges today.

Adam Purinton pleads guilty to 3 hate crimes in KCK federal court-sentencing set for July 2nd @KMBZradio — Bill Grady (@KMBZBill) May 21, 2018

Adam Purinton, of Olathe, admitted in a plea deal that he shot Indian-nationals Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani, attempting to kill both men, because of their race, color, religion, and national origin.

The guilty plea removes the death penalty from the sentencing for Purinton.

Purinton was convicted of murder and attempted murder last month, and has already been given what is essentially a life sentence in prison for killing Garmin engineer Srinivas Kuchibhotla, wounding fellow engineer Alok Madasani, and wounding Ian Grillot who tried to intervene.

It is expected that he will be given another life sentence to run consecutively when he is sentenced July 2nd",1
"In the aftermath of the brutal beating and death of a teenage Muslim girl in Virginia, liberal activists and some civil rights organizations rushed to frame the killing as a hate crime.

Many said that Nabra Mohmod Hassanen’s killer was obviously motivated by loathing for Muslims, one of many minority groups suffering under the “climate of hate” that President Donald Trump’s administration has created.

The storyline began to collapse when The Daily Caller and other outlets reported that the alleged killer, Darwin Martinez Torres, was not a white supremacist bigot, as some alleged, but rather a 22-year-old illegal immigrant from El Salvador. Despite the total absence of evidence of a hate crime — Fairfax County police called it a “road rage” incident — many commentators continued to assert that Hassanen’s murder was an illustrative example of bias against Muslims in American society. (RELATED: Liberals Blamed White Supremacy For Muslim Teen Murdered By Illegal Immigrant From El Salvador)

“It may well be true that in the case of Hassanen, no verbal slurs were exchanged … But it’s nonetheless equally true that Torres’s choice to harass a group of visibly Muslim teenagers cannot help but tie into a wider discourse about the roles and acceptance of Muslim Americans,” wrote Vox’s Tara Burton.

Progressive activist Jose Antonio Vargas, himself an illegal immigrant, was quick to invoke Islamophobia as well:

Already teetering, the narrative collapsed completely Tuesday, when new details about Torres’ background emerged in media reports. As it turns out, Torres allegedly killed Hassanen not because he didn’t “accept” Muslim Americans, but because he is a suspected gang member with a history of violence toward women.

A week before Torres was arrested for the murder, he allegedly beat and sexually assaulted a Loudoun County woman, according to a Child Protective Services report shared with the Washington Post. The woman told emergency room staff that a man punched and kicked her in the presence of a child, and that the assailant, whom she declined to identify by name, was a member of the violent MS-13 street gang.

Authorities were able to identify Torres as the attacker in that incident, following his arrest for Hassanen’s murder. As the WaPo article noted, the CPS report confirms that Torres has previously committed violent acts “unrelated to a hate crime motivation.”

Ironically, WaPo was one media outlet eager to attribute the Hassanen murder to a supposedly pervasive atmosphere of hate across the country. In a June 19 piece, WaPo columnist Petula Dvorak called the killing “an attack on all of us.”

“Nabra was killed by some kind of toxic mix of hate and rage, there’s no doubt about that — even if it doesn’t meet the legal definition of a hate crime,” Dvorak wrote.

The selective outrage from Vox, WaPo and others over Hassanen’s murder stood in contrast to the relative indifference showed to other killings across the country. The same day that Dvorak’s column ran, Chicago police confirmed that eight people had been killed over a single, bloody Father’s Day weekend. (RELATED: Chicago Celebrates Father’s Day With More Than 50 People Shot)

One of the victims, Tiara Viramontes, was a 17-year-old high school student like Nabra Hassanen. Police suspect that she, too, was killed by a gang member.

Unlike the Hassanen murder, however, Viramontes’ death didn’t lend itself to provocative takes on white supremacy or lamentations about the rise of Islamophobia in America, and thus received no attention from the national media.

"Throughout the month of October, Orland Park police will be out in the community to ensure drivers and pedestrians safely follow traffic-safety laws. OPPD will be out three separate times to conduct its second Cop on a Bus awareness campaign. Patrol officers will ride along on Orland Park school buses watching for vehicles passing school buses when the stop arms are out and the stop lights are flashing. When the officer spots a violation, he or she will report it to a partner working the area who will then initiate a traffic stop. Orland Park Police conduct the Cop on a Bus campaign as a way to ensure that all drivers are properly stopping for school buses that are either loading or unloading school children, Trustee Dan Calandriello said, head of the villages Public Safety Committee. Often drivers are distracted or in a hurry, but we want everyone to take the extra time to follow protocol and keep school zones safe. According to the Illinois State Board of Education, children are at the greatest risk when they are getting on or off the school bus. Most children killed in bus-related crashes are pedestrians, five to seven years old, who are getting on or off the bus. These children are hit by the school bus or by motorists illegally passing a stopped school bus. Officers will be issuing citations to drivers who do not stop when a school bus has its stop arm out. This is a crucial safety law that everyone must follow, said Police Chief Tim McCarthy. According to the Illinois State Police, it is unlawful for a driver to pass a school bus that has stopped to load or unload children when its stop signal arm is extended. School bus drivers may call police with the license plate numbers of vehicles that illegally pass them. In those instances, state statute provides that the owner is responsible for identifying the operator of the vehicle if they were not the driver when the violation occurred. Otherwise, the owner faces the charges. As residents prepare for Halloween, OPPD will conduct numerous pedestrian crosswalk safety checks at various crosswalks within the village, including Ravinia Avenue by the Orland Park Public Library, on 151st St. by Lakeview Plaza, and by Catalina Drive. OPPD reminds drivers that they must come to a complete stop and yield when a pedestrian is in the marked crosswalk. Under the state law, a crosswalk is present whenever a sidewalk leads into the street, regardless of any markings present, Calandriello said. As soon a pedestrian has entered the crosswalk, drivers are required to stop, not just slow down. Its important for drivers to cautiously look out for pedestrians. McCarthy added, The goal of these checks is to ensure that pedestrians are kept safe while walking in the village, and that drivers are well aware of – and follow - the states traffic-safety laws.",0

The family car was destroyed in an arson attack outside their home early on Sunday morning.

It followed two previous incidents when their cars tyres were slashed.

Prudently, law enforcement officials are withholding judgment as to the motivation pending things like, you know, actual evidence. At this point it’s not at all clear why the perpetrator of this crime did what he (or she) did.

Was it the result of some racial or religious animus? Was it kids pulling a random prank? Was it some inebriated moron engaging in vandalism for laughs?

"An 84-year-old man was beaten and harassed by a man screaming anti-Semitic remarks at a Jewish nursing home in the Bronx on Sunday, police say. Ken Buffa reports.

A man walked into a Jewish nursing home in the Bronx, tried to rob an elderly resident and then beat the older man and yelled anti-Semitic remarks at him, police said Sunday.

Alen Califano, 41, of Yonkers, was charged with robbery, burglary, a hate crime, assault, criminal possession of a weapon and possession of marijuana, police said.

The 84-year-old victim lives at the New Jewish Home in the Fordham neighborhood, where his friend told NBC 4 New York that a new security guard let the man into the home to use a bathroom Saturday afternoon.

Instead of going to the bathroom, police say the intruder started rummaging through apartments, eventually ending up at the victims apartment, where he lit a joint.

Califano struck the older man with a cardboard tube and a fire extinguisher, all while demanding money from him and yelling anti-Semitic remarks, police said.

He has a walker, and he hit him in the mouth, over here in the face, said Eddie Morales, who lives in the building and witnessed part of the attack.

Police said Califano had many prior arrests dating back to when he was 19 years old. It wasnt clear whether he had an attorney.



Leslie Hoot, the director of University Avenue Assisted Living, said the victim is a wonderful, kind and gentle man and that the guard who let the attacker in has been fired.

“This isolated incident is the result of an unacceptable breach of protocol committed by a guard employed by the private firm contracted to provide security at this assisted living facility,” Hoot said in a statement.

She said University Avenue Assisted Living has demanded an incident report and remedial action plan from the security firm.

Lemire was furious. He was angry that Rai, a man who emigrated from India 20 years ago, someone who worked seven days a week, a man who treated his employees like family was wounded.

Lemire said he immediately thought about bringing over dinner to the Rai family, who live down the street from him, but he wanted to do something he thought might be more culturally appropriate.



His wife consulted with colleagues in India and they came up with the plan to deliver Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups and roses – red ones for Rai’s wife and white, more masculine looking flowers, for Rai.

“He’s Sikh, he’s Indian. He’s very caring to me and there’s only two employees and he’s good to both of us,” Lemire said, standing on Rai’s doorstep Monday. “He is an American.”

Lemire said Rai was at their plumbing company’s headquarters Friday night when the shooting occurred.

Kent police say a man wearing a mask approached Rai and opened fire.

“Some comments were made to the effect of get out of our country, go back to where you’re from,” Kent Police Chief Ken Thomas said after the shooting.



In the days since the shooting, Kent police have dedicated a team of officers to find the suspect, Thomas said. The FBI is assisting with the investigation.

FBI Seattle spokeswoman Ayn Dietrich-Williams said Monday afternoon that the Bureau and the Department of Justice have opened a civil-rights investigation into the shooting.

“The FBI is working with the Kent Police Department and will collect all available facts and evidence to determine if there is a federal civil rights violation. As this is an ongoing investigation we are not able to comment further at this time,” Dietrich-Williams said in a statement.

The shooting comes weeks after the shootings of two Indian computer engineers in a Kansas bar – one of the engineers died. The gunman allegedly shouted racial slurs before opening fire.

Rai has declined any media interviews. Lemire said he doesn’t know the future of the small plumbing company.

Thomas said he met with the wounded man over the weekend.

“I actually had an opportunity to meet with the victim yesterday. He seems to be doing ok,” Thomas said.

Lemire said he would have taken a bullet for his boss and said that if Rai returns to work he wants to make sure they all work in pairs for the next few months. While police haven’t said whether Rai was targeted, Lemire believes his boss generated attention because he was wearing a turban and has a short beard.

“I think a lot of times you stereotype. You look at things with all the Muslims or all the terrorists or whatever. You can’t bunch everyone up,” Lemire said.",1

"GRAND PRAIRIE, TX — A Grand Prairie man is in jail after a barrage of bizarre alleged criminal activity on Friday. The man, identified as Bill Nguyen, 47, is accused of pistol-whipping a nail salon employee and trying to set the salon ablaze before he was taken down and held at gunpoint by an armed onlooker. Police said Nguyen is also accused of murder in connection to a dead body found inside a burning home near the salon. Police were first called to the nail salon in the 5100 block of Magna Carta Boulevard around 10:20 a.m. Friday. Witnesses there told police Nguyen came into the salon holding a gun and attacked a female employee, hitting her several times with the pistol. During the attack, police said an onlooker with a concealed handgun license came into the salon and held Nguyen at gunpoint until police arrived. At the same time, however, police were assisting the Grand Prairie Fire Department in quelling a structure fire less than a mile away in the 2100 block of Hastings Drive. Investigators found a dead body inside the burned out home Hastings, police said, and Nguyen faces a charge of murder in connection to the unidentified person death. According to police, it is not believed anyone else is connected to these incidents. WFAA reports police are treating the investigation into the dead body and house fire as a homicide related to family violence. The woman who was pistol-whipped was taken to a trauma center but is expected to be released. In full, Nguyen is charged with arson, aggravated assault and murder. The name of the person found in the burned out home is being withheld pending next of kin notification. Lead image via Daniel Hubbard, Patch Staff",0
"The number of reported hate crimes in Georgia decreased in 2016 from the previous year, according to newly released FBI data.

According to the agency’s annual Hate Crime Statistics released Monday, 39 hate crimes were reported in the state in 2016, down five from 2015.

Of those crimes last year, 25 were motivated by race, two by religion, and 12 by sexual orientation. No reported crimes were motivated by a disability, gender or gender identity.

In 2015, 32 crimes were motivated by race, five by religion, and seven by sexual orientation.

ALSO: Douglasville judge says Confederate flag case was a hate crime

Six police departments reported a hate crime in 2016, including Atlanta, Conyers, the University of Georgia, along with Cobb, Fulton and Gwinnett County police.

Of the departments that recorded a hate crime, the majority— 25 incidents, or 64 percent — occurred in Cobb County. The total was slightly higher in 2015, with the county recording 68 percent of reported hate crimes in the state.

At the time, Cobb police said the higher number could be attributed to a computer system that lets officers designate an incident as a hate crime. Not all departments use the same system, Cobb said.

Georgia is one of a few states with no hate crime law on the books. The state Supreme Court struck down a hate crime law in 2004 because it was too vague. And, in the most recent legislative session, lawmakers failed to get a bill passed that would have refined the definition of “domestic terrorism.”

Sgt. Dana Pierce, spokesman for the Cobb County Police Department, said the department labels two or three incidents as hate crimes per month, if that, but could not answer why other agencies don’t do the same.

“I can only say what our people do is thorough,” he said Monday. “That thoroughness includes reading all reports and doing our due diligence under (Uniform Crime Reporting) code, if applicable.”

Nationally, hate crimes rose for the second straight year, according to the FBI numbers. There were more than 6,100 hate crimes last year, compared to 5,850 in 2015.

The FBI began recording hate crime data in 1990. The agency collects its data from participating law enforcement officials through the Uniform Crime Reporting Program.",1
"NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ - A resident at last weeks New Brunswick City Council meeting asked the City to do a better job of preventing drug activity, particularly along French Street. I know you cant stop a person from doing what they want to do, resident Danielle Moore said, according to TAP Into. But, oh my, seeing so many deaths and pick-ups in the one area — yes, I think its time for something to be done. According to the report, Moore said she often sees drug sales along French Street and hears of overdoses in the neighborhood. I think its just time for police department detectives to really look into that area, she said. If we can identify a trend, we investigate it further and see if we can find out whos selling narcotics, New Brunswick Police Capt. J.T. Miller told her at the Council meeting. New Brunswick police had to administer Narcan, a medicine used in opiate overdoses, to 23 people in 2o16, according to data the police department gave TAP Into.

"In the wake of numerous highly-publicized hate crimes on Long Island, community leaders are advocating for more education to prevent future incidents.

The Nassau County District Attorney’s office created a special unit on Feb. 27 specifically to prosecute hate crimes. Caryn Stepner, chief of the new hate crimes unit, is hoping to bring attention to the problem before it escalates further.

“We’re trying to educate the community that hate and prejudice biases are not appropriate and specifically if they use hate or bias in committing a crime, then the exposure and their punishment could be enhanced,” Stepner said.

New York State ranks fourth in the country in terms of total hate crimes, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Even though the Nassau County Police Department reported in March that crimes in Nassau County are decreasing, Stepner said 56 hate crimes were reported in the county last year. Forty-two of these were anti-Semitic. Currently, the unit has eight felony cases pending; four people have been indicted. Crimes involving prejudice are punished more severely by being upgraded from a misdemeanor to a felony.

“We’re trying to get people to appreciate the fact that there’s no place for it. If they do commit a crime based on race, bias, or hate, that the punishment is going to be higher,” said Stepner.

Nassau County has been victimized by several anti-semitic crimes in recent months. In February, the Mid Island Y Jewish Community Center in Plainview received a bomb threat and a car was spray-painted with swastikas in Mineola last December.

“The climate, in general, is a very tough one at the present time. It’s something both government and society must take very seriously,” said Rabbi Anchelle Perl from the Congregation Beth Sholom Chabad in Mineola.

Perl participated in a program with two minors involved with anti-Semitic hate crimes. The minors were required to visit the Holocaust Memorial Center in Glen Cove and listen to a Holocaust survivor. Perl, a second generation Holocaust survivor, believes hate crimes often come from a place of ignorance.

“What’s missing today is education and rehabilitation in terms of understanding the seriousness,” said Perl.

In the future, Perl hopes educational sessions will be expanded to all offenders. He communicated with the DA office to organize these events. Stepner agreed that similar programs may be applied to different types of hate crimes moving forward.

Elaine Gross, president of Erase Racism, challenged community leaders to do even more to fight hate.

“People who are in leadership must be held to account and we need to make sure that the people who are in those kinds of positions realize that they will not be in there for long if in fact, they do not take a leadership role in countering this,” said Gross.

According to Gross, hate has been “legitimized” which encourages people to commit crimes. When someone concealing hate sees another person promoting similar thoughts on television or social media, they are more likely to act on it.

“They [hate crime offenders] may have been harboring these ideas and these thoughts all along but they are given an opportunity to take action in a way that leads to confirm their beliefs and their ideas rather them feeling that they’re on the outside,” said Gross.

Gross added that a climate of fear may prevent some people from reporting crimes.

Gabriela Andrade, an immigration and community organizer at Make the Road New York, believes attitudes toward minorities and immigrants are getting worse.

“Even if someone is harassing them or someone has threatened them some people don’t want to say anything because they’re afraid. The fact that people are very scared and afraid makes them very vulnerable,” said Andrade.

To counter this fear, Andrade and her organization host workshops on Long Island which help inform people about their rights and to erase any doubts they may have about the police.

“We want them to be ready and know their rights and know they shouldn’t be afraid.”",1
"Richland Countys Financial Crimes Unit investigators arrested 10 suspects and are looking for eight more in connection with a tax refund scam operation. Investigators say in 2012 a tax preparer at M&M Tax Service falsified W-2 forms for people she recruited by claiming those people made between $19,000 and $25,000 during the year 2011.

Ridgefield High and Ballard Park have not been the only targets for the vandals. In January, following the discovery of five swastikas drawn outside the Masonic Lodge and Aldrich Museum, the Anti-Defamation League offered a $2,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible.

"“As women of color, we endure endless amounts of micro-aggressions and outright aggressive behaviors from all areas of our lives. Sadly, the majority of us are always told to just “shake it off” or “keep your head up.” But how can you shake off thousands of tiny cuts when they draw blood again and again? How can you keep your head up under all those negative assertions? Here’s the trick: you don’t do it alone. You ask for help. You ask your friends. You ask adults you trust. You ask your teachers. You ask your school counselor. You reach out to mental health hotlines. You reach out to therapists. Ask anyone whom you trust or is a professional. There is power in community and in knowing that you are not carrying this burden alone. You might feel all alone but there are people in your life who want to help you. There are even people who don’t know you who want to help you. You are incredible. You are beautiful. You are not alone.” - Elizabeth Ho, actor, Netflix’s Disjointed

“There are those who seem to go out of their way to make you feel, sometimes in the most painful ways, that you don’t fit in or you don’t belong. One day, you’ll realize the things that make you an “outsider” are the very things that give you a sense of identity and community. Find strength, hope and purpose in identity and community.” - Phil Yu, blogger, Angry Asian Man

“I guarantee that if you are being bullied it is because you are doing something right. You are some combination of incredibly talented, unique, smart and sensitive. You may look different, sound different and act differently than your peers but that is what will one day make you amazing. You probably can see how you’re “supposed” to act, look and believe - but you just can’t bring yourself to be like everyone else - and even when you DO try to fit in, you only seem to stand out MORE. You might think you’re alone, but I’d bet that there is probably a select group of people who feel like you - and they will become your lifelong friends - and you will be able to live as your genuine, true self in their company. Protect each other, love each other, and celebrate how incredibly beautiful it is that you all are so “weird.” If you are being bullied - it’s because you are doing something right. You are special. You are strong. And one day you will be able to write a note like this to someone else and let them know it.” - Utkarsh Ambudkar, actor, Pitch Perfect and White Famous

“I exist in this hyphen. I’m an Indian-American-Muslim kid, but am I more Indian or am I more American? What part of my identity am I? I struggled with that as a kid. I wanted to be accepted. I experienced bullying in high school – a kid peed on my shoes, I was called the ‘color of poop.’ A lot of immigrants feel like if you come to this country you pay the American dream tax: you’re gonna endure some racism, and if it doesn’t cost you your life, hey, you lucked out. But I actually have the audacity of equality. I want to tell kids that no matter what anyone tells them, they’re not alone. There is help. Despite whatever is going on in the White House, I believe there is possibility for change, which I think is awesome.” - Hasan Minhaj, comedian

“I went through high school not feeling safe. I was the butt of most jokes, teased, and mocked often. And all I did was push it down. I pushed my feelings down for years: laughing with the jokes, pretending everything was ok when my parents saw me sad and just pushing through. Please don’t do what I did. If you are feeling bullied or made to feel unsafe, talk to someone - that could be a guidance counselor, a teacher, or family. When I finally took the chance to be vulnerable with my family and tell them how I felt, the support I got was stunning! When we are bullied we believe that it is our fault and no one loves us. That’s NOT true. You are loved by more places than you know!” - Arjun Gupta, actor (Showtime’s Nurse Jackie and Syfy’s The Magicians) and producer

“As a child, it’s awful to feel less than because of who you are. Differences are what make our communities so rich. And I’ve often found that, the thing you’ve been made fun of for the most, is generally what will make you stand out, when you are older. Stay brave. Stay bold.” - Sheetal Sheth, actor, producer, author, activist

“I was a little immigrant girl from Taiwan and remember feeling so lonely and confused because I felt so different. Before I could fully understand English I remember I was six years old and playing freeze tag with the neighborhood kids. It was fun until a boy from the other street came by and started to taunt me in English words that sounded mean. My face felt hot with tears at the anger that was coming from him. Lucky for me, I had a friendly, freckle-faced girl defend me and yell at him to stop. I won’t ever forget how awesome she was for standing up for me. We all grow up feeling different and weird. Some people like taking advantage of our insecurities. But we can make the choice to not make others feel bad and to stand up for others when you see them get hurt. Growing up and finding our way is hard enough, be a leader in your school and community and encourage each other to practice kindness and support.” - Jenny Yang, comedian

“I was the only Indian kid in my class and I remember being nervous every time the teacher would read my name out loud. I was worried it would be mispronounced, the students would laugh and then I’d have to explain it’s more like “Pootie and the blowfish” not like “Silly Putty”. Writing and performing gave me a chance to explore my feelings, gain confidence and meet lots of cool people from multicultural backgrounds. That helped. And I was already running from my feelings metaphorically speaking so when I started to physically run that also helped. I wish I would have talked about my feelings more and I wish I would have asked more questions, but over time I learned I am not alone. And you aren’t either.” - Danny Pudi, actor",1

"OAKLAND (CBS SF) — On the eve of Game One of the NBA Finals Wednesday, Cleveland Cavaliers star Lebron James found himself not talking about the Golden State Warriors during media day but instead addressing an incident where someone spray painted a racial slur on the front gate of his Los Angeles suburban Brentwood home.

Los Angeles Police Spokeswoman Capt. Patricia Sandoval said the property manager told officers they believe the incident was captured on surveillance video.

Sandoval said an unidentified person sprayed painted the N-word on the front gate. Police are investigating it as an act of vandalism and possible hate crime.

When it was James turn to take the podium on Finals media day in Oakland, the first question he was asked was about the incident.

The NBA superstar told reporters that “racism will always be a part of the world.”

“As I sit here on the eve of one of the greatest sporting events that we have, race and what’s going on comes again on my behalf and my family’s behalf,” he said. “But I look at it as if this sheds light and continues to keep the conversation on my behalf. Then I’m okay with it. My family is safe. At the end of the day they are safe and that’s the most important.”

“But it just goes to show that racism will always be a part of the world. A part of America. Hate in American especially for African Americans is living every day. Even though that it is concealed most of the time, even though people hide their faces and will say things about you…They see you, they smile at your face. It’s alive every single day.”

LeBron James’ extended comments on racist graffiti:

James said one of the first thoughts was about Emmett Till and his family. Till was raised in Chicago but was lynched in Mississippi in 1955 at the age of 14. When his body was returned to Chicago for burial, his family insisted on an open casket to make a statement about racism in America

“I think back to Emmett Till’s mom actually it’s one of the first things I thought of,” he told reporters “The reason she had an open casket is becuase she wanted to show the world what her son went through as far as a hate crime and being black in America.”

James was asked how his family is handling the situation.

“The most unfortunate part is I’m here and can’t be at home to see my boys right now,” he said. “My little girl is too young to actually understand it right now. I can’t sit in front of my boys and I won’t be home until next week so this is kind of killing me inside. But my wife is unbelievable. My mother, my mother-in-law, my sister-in-law they are going to do a great job talking to them when they get home from school today. Because of Apple being so great I can FaceTime them. But I like doing a face-to-face conversation when it comes to something like this.”

“Having two sons that have great minds, that are very open to life. For me to give them a blueprint as much as I can on what life has to offer (is important) but at the end of the day they are going to have to walk their own path.”",1
"Steven Joshua Dinkle, scheduled for release from federal prison in Louisiana in August after serving 15 months for being a felon in possession of a firearm, now will serve 10 more years in a state prison.



Former Ku Klux Klan Exalted Cyclops Steven Joshua Dinkle earns another 10 years in prison for his sexual assault of a medicated woman. (2012 booking photo/Walton County, FL)

The 31-year-old former Klansman was sentenced last week in state court in Ozark, Alabama, after being convicted of sexually assaulting a medicated woman and videotaping the crime.

Dinkle did not take the stand in his own defense in the trial, but has maintained his innocence and plans to appeal his latest conviction, his attorney told media outlets.

“The state is very thankful that the judge saw fit to give him [the maximum] 10 years and make it consecutive [to his current] federal sentence,” Dale County District Attorney Kirke Adams told an Alabama television station.

While serving as the “exalted cyclops” of the Ozark chapter of the International Keystone Knights, Dinkle was arrested by the FBI in November 2013 in Mississippi on federal hate crime charges stemming from a 2009 cross burning in a predominantly black neighborhood in Ozark.

He pleaded guilty to those charges in February 2014, confessing that he “burned the cross because of the victims’ race and color and because they were occupying homes” in an Ozark neighborhood.

His mother, Pamela Morris, also a Klan member, was arrested in 2013 on charges of lying to a grand jury about her son’s involvement in the cross-burning.

She was sentenced to 10 years in prison, but was released after serving only about a year, federal records indicate.

Dinkle was released from prison in 2015 for the cross-burning conviction, only to be arrested again for being a felon in possession of a .32 caliber pistol.

"St. John police published years of department data for the public to view as part of a national initiative to be more transparent with hate and bias crimes, Chief James Kveton said.

“If the information is available to the public anyway and there’s nothing to hide … why not just share?” Kveton said.

At least nine datasets with information dating back to 2005 are open to the public on the department’s website, including traffic stops, citations, arrests, calls for service, officer-involved shootings, community engagement, use of force and hate crime.

St. John joined 53 other law enforcement agencies across the country that published the hate and bias crime data as part of the Police Data Initiative.

Kveton said his department worked on making the information public after he went to Washington, D.C., in 2016 with other police chiefs across the country to discuss The President’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing. One of the goals they talked about was data sharing, Kveton said.

With the help of IT staff, St. John started putting different datasets on the department’s website, most of which were programmed to be regularly updated, he said.

“Sharing it overtly like this, it saves resources, it saves time,” Kveton said.

The alternative is that someone comes to the police department to request information, then the department spends time and money locating the information, researching it, copying it and producing it, he said.

“This way, anyone can see it,” Kveton said.

Hate crimes, and crime in general, tend to be underreported, Kveton said.

“Sometimes people feel that they don’t want to bother the police or maybe it won’t be solved or they don’t want to be embarrassed. There’s a lot of reasons why people don’t report certain types of crime,” Kveton said.

Each year, the FBI releases its hate crime statistics where law enforcement agencies submit data to the reports. Between 2007 and 2016, Munster, Hammond, Highland and Portage reported at least one or more hate crime incident in their jurisdiction, the reports show. Indiana, however, is one of a few states with no specific hate crime legislation on the books.

By making this information public, people can be more informed in trying to prevent future situations, Kveton said.

According to St. John’s data, the department recorded two bias crimes, labeled “anti-black,” in 2005 and 2009.

Police were dispatched May 20, 2005, to the 11600 block of South Magoun Drive, according to a police report. A man who was delivering newspapers said another man approached him and “was making racial slurs,” the report states.

The man “struck” the newspaper deliverer “in the face with a closed fist, breaking his eyeglasses” and began hitting his car, the report states. The deliverer pushed back, cutting the man with a set of keys he had in his hand, according to the report.

When police talked to the man in question, he said the newspaper deliverer “had been playing very loud music in his car which disturbed (him) inside his residence” and had gone to confront him about the loud music when “a verbal altercation ensued,” the report states.

On Jan. 9, 2009, a woman reported to St. John police that her daughter was going to class at school “when she was shoved from behind as the suspect pushed past her,” a report states.

The person told her daughter “you’re walking too (expletive) slow” and said “why don’t you go back to Gary,” according to the report.

The daughter dropped off her books at a classroom and went to her locker when the person approached again and the two pushed each other, the report states.

“During the argument, suspect spit in victim’s face,” the report states.

"On Saturday, August 31, 2013, at 9:40 a.m., the Skokie Police Department was notified by Evanston Police that an offender from a battery incident in Evanston was traveling through Skokie via a CTA bus.  Shortly after the notification, Skokie Police Officers were dispatched to the 4800 block of Oakton St. for a disturbance at a local area business.  The suspects description matched the description provided by Evanston Police. Within the 4800 block of Oakton St., the suspect confronted a business owner on the sidewalk. The owner ran back into the business and locked the door.  The suspect then attempted to kick in the front door of the business.  A  Skokie Officer arrived on the scene and approached the suspect.  The suspect then brandished a sharp edged knife.  Additional Skokie Officers arrived on scene shortly thereafter.  The suspect refused to put the weapon down after several verbal commands by the officers.  The suspect lunged towards officers with the knife, multiple times.  During the encounter, the suspect continued to move east on the sidewalk toward Skokie Blvd.  The incident eventually made its way to the intersection of Oakton St. and Skokie Blvd.  During the incident, in an attempt to stop the imminent threat, the officers struck the suspect with a baton and sprayed him with Oleoresin Capsicum spray (pepper spray), neither having any effect on his threatening actions.  The suspect again lunged towards the officers with the knife.  One officer fired one round at the suspect, striking him in the left leg.  Additionally, the suspect was positively identified as being the person wanted by Evanston P.D. The suspect is believed to be a 53 year old male resident of Mount Prospect, IL.  He was transported to St. Francis Hospital in Evanston, IL. for his injuries, where he is in stable condition and in police custody.   No Skokie Officers were injured as a result of this incident. The Officer involved in the shooting incident is a 14 year veteran of the Skokie Police Department.  As is common with suburban police agencies, a follow-up investigation is being conducted by the Illinois State Police Public Integrity Task Force; Cook County States Attorneys Office, and the Skokie Police Department. Criminal charges against the suspect are under review and will be announced at a later date.

"Add Salt Lake County to the list of local governments calling for a tougher hate crimes law in Utah.

The County Council on Tuesday unanimously passed a resolution asking state lawmakers to stop talking or studying the need to change existing law — something they’ve been doing for at least a decade — and finally pass a bill.

The county joins six other government bodies that have passed similar resolutions in recent months, including Beaver County and the cities of Midvale, Moab, Salt Lake, South Salt Lake and West Jordan.

The resolution was sponsored jointly by councilmen Arlyn Bradshaw, a Democrat who is openly gay, and Republican Michael Jensen.

What passed however was a second proposal from Republican Richard Snelgrove that married Bradshaw’s specific call for legislative action with an expanded and detailed list of religious groups commonly targeted in bias crimes, including Jews, Mormons, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs and others.

“I’d like to see less hate in our community, less racism, less homophobia, less Islamophobia, less Mormonphobia, less anti-Semitism,” Snelgrove said, noting that he sees the seeds of hate being sewn on the comment boards of most media outlets in Utah. “It’s unfortunate.”

Hate crimes are considered particularly egregious because beyond their specific victim, the acts send a broader message to the community to which the victim belongs.



Utah passed its first hate crimes bill about 20 years ago and there are currently three existing statutes.

None make it a crime to target a victim based on their real or perceived membership in any historically recognized vulnerable group including age, ancestry, disability gender or gender identity, race, religion or sexual orientation.

For years, state lawmakers have balked at changing existing law, primarily because of concerns that doing so would create special or additional rights and protections for the lesbian, bisexual, gay and transgender community.

Sen. Daniel Thatcher, R-West Valley City, is expected to reprise his unsuccessful 2017 attempt to pass a so-called “victim selection” bill when the Legislature convenes in two weeks.

The bill would allow judges to raise the floor on the statutory penalties ascribed to a charged crime if a defendant is convicted of a bias-motivated crime, Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill told the Council on Tuesday.

Nationally, the FBI has said hate crimes have risen 40 percent since 2015. Utah data shows some 566 hate crimes have been reported to the Department of Public Safety since 2007, Gill said. The fewest number — 40 — were reported in 2008, and the highest — 102 — in 2012.

In 2016, the number was 66, with the majority of crimes targeting victims for their religion or race. On a more “granular level,” Gill said 26 hate crimes were reported in Salt Lake County in 2016; 21 associated with race and ethnicity, three with religion and one each for sexual orientation and disability.

Gill also shared his own experience of being targeted with slurs in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks by some people in a truck who yelled at him as he walked near Salt Lake City Hall.

“They yelled at me ‘sand n----- go home or we’ll [expletive] kill you,’” Gill said. “I remember thinking about the community I belong to, other Indians that would be targeted because of what was going on.”

No citizen of the United States, or resident of Utah or Salt Lake County should have to suffer that kind of deliberately incited fear, he said, which is why prosecutors and police have for years asked lawmakers for a tougher law.",1
"PORTLAND, Ore. — The man accused of killing two men and wounding a third who tried to stop his anti-Muslim tirade against two teenagers on a Portland, Oregon, light-rail train shouted he was not guilty Wednesday during a courtroom outburst directed at one of the victims.

Not guilty, Jeremy Christian said before a pause, of anything but defending myself against the violent aggression by Micah Fletcher!

Fletcher was in the courtroom but said nothing to reporters and displayed no reaction as he left with his father. The 21-year-old was stabbed in the neck during the May 26 attack that killed Ricky Best and Taliesin Namkai-Meche.

Christian was arraigned in a 15-count indictment charging him with aggravated murder, attempted murder and other crimes. The judge did not ask him for a plea during the two-minute hearing, but court records show the entry of not guilty pleas.

The stabbings shocked the liberal city and deepened worries about a series of apparent hate crimes in the region and contentious public rallies that have drawn national attention.

Prosecutors who have reviewed videos and interviews with witnesses say in court papers that Christian yelled hateful comments at two black girls, one of whom was wearing an Islamic head covering called a hijab.

When the girls moved away from Christian, he made a sudden move toward Namkai-Meche. The two got into a confrontation, prompting Fletcher to stand up.

Christian shoved Fletcher in the chest and then pulled out a knife that he concealed in his right hand, prosecutor Ryan Lufkin wrote. Fletcher pushed Christian back, causing him to stumble.

Christian asked Fletcher to Hit me again! as Fletcher kept telling him to get off the train.

Christian then stabbed Fletcher, Namkai-Meche and a third man who intervened, Best.

The defendant is being held without bail at a jail in downtown Portland. He due in court again July 18.

Court officials made Wednesdays hearing earlier and banned livestreaming in an effort to avoid the chaos that erupted at Christians first court appearance.

Last week, Christian shouted, You call it terrorism; I call it patriotism! and spectators watching a video feed in the hallway because they could not get a seat nearly brawled with one of the suspects supporters before turning their anger against sheriffs deputies.

Four charges in Christians indictment stem from a confrontation Christian had with a black woman at a light-rail station a day before the killings. He hit her in the face with a bottle before she pepper-sprayed him, Portland police Sgt. Pete Simpson said.",1

"UPDATED–Dr. David B. Cohen, the surgeon who was shot Thursday at Johns Hopkins Hospital in East Baltimore, has been upgraded to good condition, according to hospital spokesman Gary Stephenson. The family issued a statement Monday regarding  the incident. We are deeply appreciative of the outpouring of support and concern for us during this difficult time, the statement said.  We are especially grateful to everyone at Johns Hopkins who worked to make Davids recovery possible. Now it is important that  our time and energy be focused on Davids recovery.  David is in good condition and continuing to recover more and more every day.  We are asking the media to please respect our privacy during this time of healing.  Thanks for your understanding. Meanwhile, Baltimore police searched the Virginia home of the shooter while the citys police commissioner met with other city universities to review coordinated emergency response procedures. Cohen is expected to make a full recovery, although it is unclear when he will be discharged from the hospital. Cohens family and friends asked the media to respect her familys right to privacy. They are a very private family, Stephenson said. The Cohens Cockeysville neighbors have said that Cohen and his family keep mostly to themselves. Paul Warren Pardus, 50, shot Cohen in the abdomen after becoming dissatisfied with the quality of care being given to his mother. After shooting Cohen, Pardus turned the gun on his mother, killing her and then himself. The Baltimore Police Department obtained warrants today to search Parduss home in the 2100 block of South Kenmore Street in Arlington for evidence of a pre-meditated attack. It looks like he may have taken some time off recently to care for this mother who was ill. Theres nothing right now that points to the fact that this was a pre-meditated attack against Johns Hopkins or the doctor, said Anthony Guglielmi, spokesman for the Baltimore Police Department. He was just dissatisfied with the quality care that she received at the hospital and he unfairly took it out on the doctor. When reports of gunfire in the hospital first emerged, Baltimore police immediately began working with Hopkins security staff, among others, to restore safety to the facility. Guglielmi said police Commissioner Frederick Bealefeld was very pleased with the response, but the department wanted to take the opportunity to improve existing security measures. Hopkins, when we went in there, it was so turn-key that it was almost like their security force was an extension of the BPD, Guglielmi said. We were all speaking the same language. They understood the command structure. Bealefeld today met with the heads of all universities and most hospitals in the Baltimore area to review response protocol. We want to make sure that (system) exists at other places, God forbid we get a campus gunman or a Virginia Tech incident on our hands here in Baltimore, Guglielmi said. The time that it would take for the police department to go in and set up an infrastructure and make sure that everyone is on the same page is valuable time that could mean the difference of living and dying.",0

"Photo: York County Jail

A man walking to a 7-Eleven store in Maine was brutally attacked and berated with racial slurs, according to the Bangor Daily News.

Attorney Janet Mills office filed a civil complaint in York County Superior Court against the two men who committed the hate crime back in April.

SPONSORED

The men charged and arrested are Dusty Leo, 27, and Maurice Diggins, 34.

According to court documents the defendant was minding his own business when Leo and Diggings approached him in a pickup truck. The two men allegedly broke his jaw and yelled racial slurs at him. They beat the victim to the pavement and he got up and ran for his life.

Mills said this was a crime rooted in hate.

“All Mainers should be shocked by this brutal race-based assault,” Mills said. “This attack has shattered the victim’s sense of safety. No person should be afraid to walk to a store for fear of being attacked due to the color of his or her skin. We filed this action to protect not simply this victim but any person of color who might be targeted by these defendants.”

Both men have a criminal background.

Leo was released from jail at the end of April on a $2,500 cash bond. Diggins is still being held on $10,000 cash bail and probation.",1
"Middletown, NJ - A Hazlet woman was charged with trying to hide heroin in her vagina when she and a male companion were stopped by police in Middletown Township late last month. This is not exactly an uncommon occurrence: A Manalapan man was found hiding 12 folds of heroin in his buttocks in June, and in December, a Keansburg woman tried to hide Xanax in her vagina before being searched by police. In that case, she took the pills out and swallowed them before the police could confiscate them. Police stopped Kristen Squeo, 34, and David Kneipp, 30, both of South Park Avenue in Hazlet, on Thursday, June 30 in Middletown Township, near Keansburg High School. Both had heroin and Xanax on them, police said, enough that they intended to sell the drugs. When the couple was stopped and searched, Squeo tried to hide a cut straw of heroin inside her vagina, police said. She was charged with knowingly concealing physical evidence in her vaginal cavity, a crime of the fourth degree. Kneipp was found to have 76 decks of heroin on him, and 20 doses of Xanax. Police said that before they were arrested the duo sold some of the heroin to another person.",0
"Two men were sentenced on Thursday to three years in prison for attacking a Sikh man in California last year, repeatedly punching him through his car window and cutting off his hair.

Mr. Khalsa, an information technology specialist, was dressed in traditional Sikh garb, including a turban, while heading to a religious ceremony.

The defendants, along with three other men, had been drinking that day and were on their way to get a food when they pulled up next to Mr. Khalsa’s car, Simon O’Connell of the Contra Costa district attorney’s office said in October. Beer cans were thrown at Mr. Khalsa, who rolled down his window and said, “You guys forgot something.”",1

"A terrible incident that occurred in York County in late April — an unprovoked attack on an African-American, allegedly by two white males — was a reminder that racism is alive and well.

The two men are accused of violating the Maine Civil Rights Act, which was enacted in 1992. This law prohibits the use or threat of violence or damage to property against a person based on that person’s race, color, religion, sex, ancestry, national origin, physical or mental disability or sexual orientation. A person who is found in violation of the law is convicted of a class D crime. In Maine, a class D crime is a misdemeanor, punishable up to 364 days in jail and a $2,000 fine.

When I learned that this crime is only a misdemeanor in Maine, I was shocked. If these two individuals are convicted, it’s essentially a slap on the wrist, and they can go home for violating the constitutional rights of a person solely based on the color of their skin. The punishment does not fit the crime. I propose the classification for a hate crime should increase to a class B crime, which, under Maine law, is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $20,000 fine. When the Legislature returns in December, I plan on taking action by having a constituent bill introduced, calling for the law to be changed to a Class B crime.

Connecticut is providing Maine — and the rest of the country — an example to follow, passing a law last year that increases the punishment for a hate crime from a misdemeanor to a felony and making a first-degree hate crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison and/or a $10,000 fine.

It’s also instructive to look at other New England states’ hate-crime laws. In Vermont, criminal charges motivated by bias bring enhanced penalties: between one more year and five more years in prison with increasing fines. In Massachusetts, a person convicted of a hate crime can serve a misdemeanor penalty of up to 2½ years in prison and a $5,000 fine. However, if bodily injury results, the penalties increase to felony level: a maximum of 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.

The accusations against the two individuals in York County do not accurately represent the state of Maine. I know this for a fact. As an African-American who lives in an overwhelmingly white state, I have felt nothing but warmth and acceptance. But this is not the case for everyone who is not white, or speaks a different language, or loves another person of the same gender.

In 2016, Maine had a rate of 3 reported hate crimes per 100,000 people, according to FBI statistics, while the national average was 2.1. What’s more, according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis, Maine is one of just eight states where hate incident rates spiked in the 10 days after President Donald Trump’s election, compared to the average annual rate between 2010 and 2015. These data highlight a problem that needs to be mitigated and a need for stronger penalties for those who commit despicable actions based on prejudice and hatred.

My motivation to change this law is not because the victim was an African-American and the alleged suspects were white. I believe that no other person should target, harass and/or assault another person because of something that makes them different. No one has the right to do that to anyone.

I have been an advocate for equality in my own way by seeking to use the law and change policies. As an undergraduate, I drafted and proposed a student bill of rights; in graduate school, I became an ally for the LGTBQ+ community by becoming a SAFE trainer. Participants in Students, Staff and Faculty for Equality training provide education and awareness on various topics that affect the LGTBQ+ community. I also witnessed growing up what racism and bigotry can do to someone, years after it happened: i.e., my father, who was born in the 1940s and came of age during the 1960s and lived with the scars of what happened to him until he died in 2015.

Maine is a welcoming state, but it also needs to show that when racism, bigotry and hatred attempt to rear their ugly heads, they will not be tolerated, and that those who interfere with a person’s civil rights will be held accountable and severely punished.

"Hate crimes against black and gay people are on the rise in liberal California, with data showing a spike in crimes motivated by a racial, religious or sexual orientation bias.

According to statistics released by the state Department of Justice on Monday, there was an overall increase of hate crimes by 11.2 percent from 2015 to 2016, with a particular spike in hate crimes against black people.

Overall, the department recorded 931 incidents in 2016, with the most common crime involving a racial bias (most often against black people) and the second most common a bias against gay people.

“When someone commits a crime motivated by hate, it is not just an attack on one innocent person, but an attack on the entire state and our communities,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement seen by Courthouse News, explaining the situation in California mirrored a similar situation in other states in the U.S.

“We can see from todays report that words matter, and discriminatory rhetoric does not make us stronger but divides us and puts the safety of our communities at risk,” he added.

Of the 931 incidents in 2016, the department recorded 251 hate crimes carried out against black people, 83 against Latinos, 152 recorded crimes against gay men, 82 anti-Semitic and 37 Islamophobic attacks, with the majority of hate crimes in the state taking place in Los Angeles County.

The data shows a double-digit rise in hate crimes in the state for a second consecutive year, although hate crime in the state remains 34 percent lower than it was in 2007, with each crime recorded as a single occurrence regardless of how many people were involved in the incident.

"SUBURBAN BOCA RATON, Fla. - Homicide detectives do not believe the murder of the only Orthodox Jewish Mixed Martial Arts fighter in the nation was a hate crime. But those same detectives remain tight-lipped about their search for the shooter.

At the same time, Aaron Rajmans family and friends are busy preparing for his funeral Thursday at Eternal Light Memorial Gardens.

Travis Taylor wore a shirt with the words “valor, loyalty and strength” printed on it while he talked about his friend.

He said those qualities appropriately describe Rajman.

“You can’t replace that kind of character. You can only strive to be like it,” Taylor said.

But the fellow MMA fighter will remember Rajman most for his motivation. Taylor admitted Rajman encouraged him to become a professional fighter.

“That’s just him, honestly,” Taylor said. “He was always the motivation person.”

That source of motivation was shot in a home west of Boca Raton Monday night. The sheriff’s office says the public is not in danger even though deputies haven’t arrested anyone.



Rajman was one of the only Orthodox Jews fighting professionally in the country. He was also a source of inspiration to his friend Ben Barel who attended a Jewish elementary school with Rajman in Boca Raton.

Barel shared a video of Rajman’s pre-fight routine on Facebook. He said Rajman prayed as he entered the “cage” while songs by Jewish singer Matisyahu blasted from the speakers.

“I never felt more connected to the religion and the most powerful thing about that was I was not in a Jewish setting,” Barel remembered.

Despite the fighter’s mentality, Rajman’s friends all remark on his caring, dedicated personality.

“If you went to anyone of his friends they would say the same things I am,” Barel explained. “That he’s a kind-hearted man and tries to find good in every situation.”

Now Rajman’s community is fighting for justice; asking anyone with information about the shooting to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-458-TIPS (8477).",1
"Weeks ago, former substitute teacher Oghenetega Edah lost his job after allegedly ripping a hijab off a young girl’s head. Police in New York City have followed up on that: The 31-year-old was arrested Wednesday for aggravated harassment as a hate crime and endangering the welfare of a child, cops announced.

Officials told The New York Daily News that he had a clean record before the May 2 incident.

Edah ordered 8-year-old Safa, the alleged victim, to take off her hjiab after she acted out in class at a public school in the Bronx. She refused, and as she told WPIX in an interview in early May, he said he couldn’t see her hair.

Edah allegedly yanked the hijab from her head and injured her eye, police said. He is scheduled for an arraignment to take place Thursday.

The New York hate crime statute covers religion. That Edah is accused of yanking off a hijab, a veil commonly worn by Muslim women to display modesty or faith in God, supports that enhanced charge.

"SOLANO COUNTY, CA -- An elderly couple was displaced from their home in Fairfield by a fire that started in a side-yard shed but spread to the main residences attic Tuesday, a fire battalion chief said. The fire in the 400 block of Chelsea Way also spread to a neighbors home and caused exterior heat damage, Fairfield Fire Battalion Chief John Sturdee said. The female resident tried to put out the shed fire before it spread, Sturdee said. The home was deemed uninhabitable, with an estimated $220,000 in total damages caused by the fire. The neighboring home was hit with some $15,000 in damage. The fire was reported just after 11 a.m. and was controlled in about an hour. Crews from Vacaville, Dixon and Cordelia fire departments also responded. The cause was considered accidental. The couple was taken in by relatives, fire officials said.

"Hate crimes and incidents of discrimination against U.S. Jews rose a staggering 57 percent last year, producing the second-highest number of such events in 40 years and the highest in 20 years according to an annual report from the Anti-Defamation League released on Tuesday.

The civil rights organization, which has monitored anti-Semitic hate crimes since 1979, noted almost 2,000 cases of vandalism, harassment, and threats targeting Jews in 2017 — the worst onslaught since 1994, when 2,066 incidents were reported. The 2017 report notably factors in the more than 160 bomb threats called into Jewish centers, all of which were found not credible and many of which have been linked to an Israeli Jewish teenager as well as a non-Jewish man in Missouri who later pled guilty to cyberstalking and anti-Semitic threats.

Even after accounting for that rise, the report paints a bleak picture. Relying on a combination of data from law enforcement and Jewish organizations, along with victim self-reporting, the ADL’s annual Audit of Anti-Semitic Incidents shows an alarming spike. Vandalism in particular appears to be on the rise — the ADL recorded 952 incidents, an 86 percent increase over 2016, where 510 such incidents were reported. Harassment increased as well, up 41 percent. Physical assault, by contrast, dropped by 47 percent.

Those numbers confirm a trend measured early on in 2017 after the ADL’s 2016 report on anti-Semitism indicated a staggering rise in hate crimes targeting Jews. At the time, the organization predicted the numbers would only worsen — something the 2017 report seemingly confirms.

“It had been trending in the right direction for a long time,” Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL chief executive, told the New York Times, referencing lower numbers in previous years. “And then something changed.”

He elaborated on that “something” to the LA Times. “Hate groups and white supremacists feel emboldened, and they are not just coming out online but are also getting involved in political campaigns,” Greenblatt said, pointing to a deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia last year, where marchers shouted “Jews will not replace us!” and carried torches.

Greenblatt also pointed to “the divisive state of our national discourse” and the anti-Semitism linked to President Trump’s administration. The White House has downplayed rising violence against Jews, in addition to leaving Jews out of a Holocaust remembrance statement last year.

That link between rhetoric and reality echoes something a number of communities have been arguing for more than a year. Organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center have documented a sharp increase in hate crimes around the country, many aimed at religious minorities (namely Jews and Muslims), along with the LGBTQ community, immigrants, and people of color more broadly, especially Black and Latinx communities. Data released by the FBI found that hate crimes rose 4.6 percent in 2016 (numbers for 2017 will be released later this year.) Among other notable findings, the FBI report observed a pattern among perpetrators: 46.3 percent were white.

Last November, leaders from Jewish, Muslim, and queer organizations told ThinkProgress that Trump’s election had sparked a severe uptick in violence aimed at their communities.

“Given the rise of the Trump campaign, white nationalism…it’s not surprising to see the rise in hate,” Ryan Ahari, then a policy analyst with the Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC), said at the time. “They’ve been validated.”

The ADL report reflects the realities Jewish communities are facing and offers data as proof, but others are struggling to even be counted. Earlier this month, a report from South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT) found that Arab, South Asian, and Muslim communities in the United States are facing a level of harassment not seen in years. One in five incidents reported involved Trump’s name or a slogan, policy, or associated comment linked to the president.

But even gathering that information was a challenge. Suman Raghunathan, SAALT’s executive director, told ThinkProgress at the time that the organization had to rely on a self-reporting system, largely because many members of those communities struggle to trust law enforcement.

“Our communities do not feel safe to report incidents of violence or harassment to the police because they feel the experience may lead to a compounding of their injury at the hands of law enforcement,” Raghunathan said. “The use of an online form and public hotlines that provide legal support have been effective in providing community members an outlet and sometimes even recourse so they are not suffering in silence after an incident.”

Even after accounting for underreporting, the FBI report on 2016 hate crimes noted a 24 percent rise in violence against Muslims, a group the White House has singled out repeatedly.

Documented rates of rising violence doesn’t seem to be swaying the Trump administration. Earlier this month, the Justice Department proposed getting rid of a 1960s-era “peacemaker” office as part of a larger budget proposal. The office’s purpose? Assisting communities facing racial tensions and hate crimes.",1
"Baltimore County police are investigating a possible hate crime involving Towson University students.

Police said two Jewish students were attacked early Sunday morning while walking to a house off-campus on the unit block of Aigburth Road.

Officials said the two students are members of the Jewish fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi.

Two suspects began making anti-Semitic statements to the two victims, said Officer Jennifer Peach, of the Baltimore Police Department.

Police said the suspects are Towson University students who followed the victims to a front yard and got into a fight.

They punched one student in the face. The other victim ran away and called 911, and then came back and tried to break up the fight. He was also assaulted, Peach said. When officers arrived, they saw one suspect was on top of one victim and a third person and the second victim were attempting to break up this incident.

The victims believed the entire altercation occurred because they were Jewish, officials said.

Towson referred the incident to its Office of Student Conduct and Office of Inclusion and Equity since the incident was reported as an assault and hate-bias incident.

The school said it takes all reports seriously and does not tolerate acts of hatred and bias.

I think its crazy this kind of thing is going on. Its unfortunate that people feel the need to do things like that. Heartbreaking, said student Jamie Hoagland.

Its not welcome anywhere, especially on a campus like this. The fact this can still happen in todays world is absolutely ridiculous, said student Josh Wein.

As a student here, I know it exists, but Ive never been exposed to any type of antisemitism, said student Nitai Zecharya.

He thinks the entire situation needs a full investigation to determine everything that happened.

Its something that never should have happened in the first place. Its wrong on both ends. At the same time, these issues sometimes escalate and people look for reasons to go after each other and justify their actions, Zecharya said.

Police said this is an alleged second-degree assault and the victims will have to go to a court commissioner to file charges. They have a year and a day to make that decision.

Towson University President Kim Schatzel released the following statement via email Tuesday morning to the TU community:

Dear Towson University Community:

I am reaching out to inform you of a truly deplorable incident that occurred off-campus between members of our own Towson University community.

On Sunday morning, Baltimore County police notified the Towson University Police Department of an off-campus call reported as an assault and hate-bias incident between TU students. TUPD immediately reached out to the students involved and, as the reporting of the incident included anti-Semitic words and actions, informed the Office of Student Conduct and the Office of Inclusion and Institutional Equity so they could begin a full and ongoing investigation.

Towson University does not tolerate acts of hatred, bias, racism or discrimination of any kind on our campus or by members of the TU community. All reports of hate-bias are taken seriously and are thoroughly investigated. Any student found responsible for such conduct is subject to sanctions including suspension and expulsion from the university.

We have contacted the victims in this case and are lending our full support to them, their families and members of the community.

Hateful conduct is inexcusable and will not be tolerated at Towson University. Our community has worked relentlessly to achieve a more diverse and inclusive campus that supports every member to thrive, regardless of their race, religion, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation or levels of ableness. I am appalled that the off-campus incident occurred between members of our own community, and wish to provide my deepest assurances that these events will be treated with the utmost urgency by me and the Towson University administration.

Anyone who is impacted by this incident, or who needs support, may contact the Counseling Center

"ASHLAND, Ky. (WSAZ) – Police officers, firefighters and other emergency personnel could be getting some extra protection under Kentucky state law.

The Senate overwhelmingly passed a bill to make them a protected class of people under the states hate crimes law on Tuesday.

While supporters say wearing a badge is worth extra protection, opponents say the bill is unnecessary.

Ashland Fire Department Acting Chief Greg Ray and Boyd County EMS Director Tom Adams agree now, more than ever, the uniform and badge can be a target.

One of people remembered in this bill is Brenda Cowan. She was a Lexington firefighter who was shot and killed in 2004 responding to a domestic violence call.

Ray said some on the Ashland department worked with her years ago in Lexington.

Its in the back of our mind that we have to look at the whole scene and make sure its safe before we can do our job, said Ray.

House Bill 14 would make emergency personnel a protected class. That means, if a judge determines an attack was motivated by someones status as a first responder, a criminal could serve more of their sentence and will be more likely to be denied probation.

I would be all for any kind of improved measures to protect our guys on the scene, adds Ray.

But Adams said he doesn’t want to treat any victim differently, even those who wear a badge.

Why is your life any less valuable than mine, he said.

But he supports the bill if it will make it easier for prosecutors to get a conviction.

If you assault anybody, it should be as valued as assaulting the police officer, said Adams.

Opponents of the bill said people who truly need special protection because of their race or sexual orientation shouldnt be put in the same grouping as a professional category. They also say this will not be a deterrent.

Its more of a feel-good vote, said State Senator Perry Clark (D).

Clark was one of five to vote no. He said its totally unnecessary.

Thats very difficult to prove what someone is thinking in their mind,” said Clark. “Thats really what the hate crime, thats what youre really getting into, the core of a persons thinking.

Senator Clark adds if Kentucky lawmakers are really interested in helping police and firefighters, theyll ditch House Bill 296 which makes major changes to workers compensation and disability benefits.

Substantive or superfluous, only time will tell.

I am not sure that its going to do anything for prevention, said Adams.

Anything we can do to increase that safety will help,” said Ray.

The bill now heads to the governors desk.

Louisiana was the first state to expand hate crime legislation to police and emergency personnel last year.

West Virginia and Ohio do not have that expansion.

Unlike Kentucky, neither one provides protection for sexual orientation.",1
"A freshman at the University of Hartford in West Hartford, Connecticut has been slapped with a hate crime due to behavior against her former roommate. Brianna Rae Brochu, 18, bragged in a now deleted Instagram post about secretly terrorizing her roommate, which included rubbing a used tampon across one of her bags. Brochu is white and her roommate Jazzy Roe is black.

Since news of Brochu’s behavior has been made public, University of Hartford President Greg Woodward called Brochu’s conduct “reprehensible.”

“It is clear there is work to be done at our University to ensure that all students feel safe, respected, and valued. The conversations that began with student groups, faculty, and staff yesterday are going to continue and involve our full community,” Woodward said.

Brochu is no longer a student at the university, and is prohibited from stepping foot on campus or contacting Roe, according to a judge order. West Hartford police are asking that the charge of of intimidation based on bigotry or bias also be added to the charge of peace and criminal mischief case.

On Oct. 17, Rowe was moving out of her apartment she shared with Brochu when Brochu asked if she was leaving. It was then Brochu took to social media to brag about all the things she did to force her roommate out. Rowe’s resident assistant who after screen grabbing Brochu’s post made Rowe aware.

“Finally did it yo girl got rid of her roommate!! After 1 ½ month of spitting in her coconut oil, putting moldy clam dip in her lotions… putting her toothbrush places where the sun doesn’t shine, and so much more I can finally say goodbye Jamaican Barbie.”

Jazzy Roe took to Twitter to create a video speaking about her experience and quickly “JusticeForJazzy” began to trend.

That roommate could’ve killed Jazzy. And she’ll do it again to another black person unless true justice is served. #JusticeForJazzy — BlackGirlinTheRing ∞ (@ShellieLovee) October 31, 2017

"A Twin Cities man who survived the 2007 Interstate 35W bridge collapse is facing charges in connection to the Islamic State. United States Attorney for the District of Minnesota Andrew M. Luger announced Wednesday a criminal complaint charging Mohamed Amiin Ali Roble, 20, with conspiring to provide material support to the Islamic State. Roble is not in custody, and the complaint states that one of his co-defendants believes Roble is now in Syria. Three co-defendants were convicted at trial earlier this year. According to the complaint, Roble received approximately $91,654.22 from settlements related to injuries he suffered in the I-35W bridge collapse. Charges allege those funds financed Robles travel to Syria and have also been used to pay for the cars of fellow ISIS members. Roble was given the money when he turned 18. He was 10 when he was injured in the bridge collapse. In August 2014, Roble attempted to apply for a passport. Roble told the passport specialist that his plans were to travel to China that month and return to the United States in September. He also told the passport specialist that he planned to study in China. When asked at which school in China he was going to study, Roble mumbled indistinctly in response and could not be understood by the passport specialist, the complaint states. Roble was issued a passport on Aug. 26, 2014. According to the complaint, on Oct. 4, 2014, Roble and his mother flew from Minneapolis to China. Roble made six cash withdrawals of approximately $1,000 each from an ATM in Wuhan, China. The withdrawals were made from the account containing the funds Roble obtained from the bridge collapse settlements. In November 2014, Roble bought airfare and flew to Istanbul, Turkey. From Turkey, Roble called his mother and told her that he was in Turkey shopping and that he needed an airline ticket back to China, which she purchased for him, according to the complaint. Roble returned to China shortly thereafter. On Dec. 27, 2014, Roble again traveled to Istanbul, but this time he did not return. About that same time, in November 2014, the complaint states that four of Robles co-defendants attempted to travel from Minnesota to Syria to join ISIS, via New Yorks JFK International Airport. The four co-defendants were stopped by federal law enforcement agents at JFK from flying from New York to various destinations in Europe. One of these men, Abdirizak Warsame, was interviewed in January 2016 and told investigators he had seen photographs on social media of Roble in a desert setting. Warsame is also charged in connection to ISIS. In some photographs, Warsame says he saw Roble carrying a black ISIS flag; in others, he is carrying what appears to be an assault rifle. So far, 11 men from the Twin Cities have been charged with trying to help ISIS, according to the Justice Department. The Pioneer Press reported that prosecutors say the men were part of a group of friends in the Twin Cities Somali community who were inspired to join ISIS. In recent years, about 12 men have left Minnesota to join militant groups in Syria, according to the FBI. Image via Shutterstock",0
"BEAUMONT, CA – A high-speed police pursuit led authorities into the Beaumont area on Tuesday afternoon, but ended when they lost sight of the stolen car, the California Highway Patrol tells Patch. It was last seen on Interstate 10 near Pennsylvania Avenue traveling at an estimated 120 miles per hours along the center divider, officials say. At around 11:30 a.m., the vehicle was taken from a liquor store parking lot in Palm Springs when the driver left it running and stepped out for a moment, according to CHP Officer Darren Meyer and the Palm Springs Police Department. From there, someone hopped into the car and took off. Palm Springs police spotted the driver and initiated a pursuit, but when the driver eventually got onto Interstate 10, the CHP took over, PSPD said on Twitter. San Gorgonio area CHP officers took over in the Cabazon area, and followed the car into Banning and Beaumont, Meyer said. However, when the chase got to the area of Pennsylvania Avenue at about 120 miles per hour, the CHP eventually lost sight of the vehicle and terminated the chase at 11:48 a.m. The car is described as a blue Volkswagen Jetta with a Washington license plate of AVM8084.

"A Boston man known as the Incognito Bandit was arrested Friday in a Virginia airport as he attempted to board a South Africa-bound flight, the U.S. Attorneys office said. Albert Taderera, 36, of Brighton, is thought to be involved in 16 bank robberies in Massachusetts since February 2015. He has been charged with armed bank robbery by criminal complaint stemming from the Oct. 7, 2016 robbery of a Wayland TD Bank. Taderera is scheduled to appear in the U.S. District Court for the District of Eastern Virginia on Monday. According to court documents, 16 banks were robbed in the MetroWest and Greater Boston areas between February 2015 and March 2017, including banks in Woburn, Waltham, Arlington, Acton, Wayland, Stoughton, and Billerica. The robber in most cases was covered in a dark hooded sweatshirt, a dark face mask/sunglasses, dark gloves, and dark clothing. In each instance the robber made verbal demands for the money. The robber in many of the robberies displayed what tellers described as a black semi-automatic handgun. All of the robberies occurred in suburban setting near wooded areas of foliage. Witnesses in many instances reported the robber leaving the bank and entering those wooded areas. Some witnesses observed the who is thought to be the robber drive away in a black BMW sedan. On March 16, Concord Police observed a black BMW sedan outside a local bank and noted Taderera fit the description of the person responsible for the 16 robberies. Police determined the BMWs registration was revoked and had it towed and inventoried. On Wednesday, March 22, Taderera called the tow company and was informed his BMW was in police custody. On Thursday night, at about 10:15 p.m., the FBI learned Taderera booked a Friday morning flight from Dulles International Airport to Addis Ababe, Ethiopia. It was learned that Taderera was en route Friday morning to Dulles out of Logan Airport, having changed his flight for Friday evening to Johannesburg, South Africa. Taderera was arrested before boarding the flight. The FBI last year doubled the reward relating to the Bandits capture to $20,000. In February 2016, FBI Boston head Harold H. Shaw said the organization was concerned about his increasingly brazen and violent behavior. Photo courtesy of U.S. Attorneys Office",0

"WALLINGFORD, CT — Three teens were arrested for burglarizing vehicles at the Oakdale Theatre Sunday night in Wallingford, according to police. In light of an increase in the thefts of and from vehicles in Wallingford and towns throughout the state, police are urging residents to lock their vehicles and to take the necessary precautions to avoid becoming a victim of a vehicle theft or burglary. Three teens in a stolen vehicle were also arrested early Monday morning after leading police on a pursuit through Wallingford before crashing into a guardrail while trying to exit Route 15 North in Meriden. Wallingford Police continue to investigate complaints involving the theft of and the theft from motor vehicles throughout town, according to Lt. Michael Colavolpe. The thefts occur during late evening and into the overnight hours with the suspects targeting vehicles that have been left unlocked and those that the owners have left the vehicles keys inside. (To sign up for Wallingford breaking news alerts and more, click here.) The police department urges residents to lock their car doors and do not leave their keys or valuables inside the vehicle. By doing so, a crime of opportunity is created, Colavolpe said in a press release. A majority of the vehicles stolen have been recovered in Hamden, Hartford, or New Haven. The vehicles have been recovered with little or no damage. In some of the cases, arrests have been made and in others the vehicles have been located unoccupied. Those arrested have been male youths ranging in age from 15 to 18 years old. In the cases of thefts from motor vehicles, Colavolpe said the suspects have been using stolen vehicles from other communities to commit the crimes. Recently, police have interrupted some of these thefts while they were in progress, however, the suspects have led police in vehicle pursuits, Colavolpe said. Since the severity of the crime does not outweigh the danger to the public, the pursuits have been called off and the suspects have not been identified. Police have made several arrests in the theft from motor vehicles cases based upon various evidence, including fingerprint or DNA evidence that has been recovered from the scene in some cases, according to Colavolpe. In other cases, the suspects have been identified through surveillance photos. The suspects have been male youths ranging in age from 15 to 18 years of old, according to Colavolpe. On Sunday night, two juveniles — one from Newington and one from Middletown — along with an 18-year-old from Bridgeport were arrested at the Oakdale Theatre for entering into unlocked vehicles. The three suspects entered the vehicles while patrons were inside the theater attending a concert, Colavolpe said. One of the juveniles led police on a lengthy foot chase before being apprehended. Early this morning, two juveniles and an 18-year-old from Hartford were arrested following a pursuit in which they were operating a stolen vehicle out of Rocky Hill. It is suspected that police caught these suspects while they were casing out neighborhoods to commit more thefts. The Wallingford Police Department has increased their patrols of neighborhoods during the overnight hours but asks that residents be vigilant and report any suspicious activity immediately.

"NEWPORT, RI—A 55-year-old Brewster, NY woman who allegedly drove drunk in Newport over the weekend will return to District Court Wednesday for arraignment. Patricia Brady was arrested Sunday after an officer on patrol reported seeing her swerving in and out of the lane and briefly driving the wrong way down a one-way section of Thames Street at around 4:20 a.m. Once stopped, Brady said she was on her way to a hotel in Middletown and smelled like alcohol, according to a police report. She later failed a field sobriety test and was taken into custody without incident. Although Brady agreed to take a preliminary breath test at the scene, but she was unable to blow hard enough to register an accurate reading, police said. Later, at police headquarters, she again did not blow hard enough to register a reading. As a result, police cited her for refusing a chemical test. Brady was released on $1,000 personal recognizance by a justice of the peace on Sunday and is expected in Newport County District Court this morning.",0
"School incidents involving hate symbols and racial slurs appear to have more than tripled during the past school year in a suburb outside Washington, D.C., and are helping drive a surge in bias-related acts investigated by police.

Since October, more than three dozen bias incidents have been reported by or linked to schools in Montgomery County, Maryland, mostly involving vandalism with swastikas, racial epithets or other bigoted messages, according to a Washington Post analysis of information provided by police and school officials.

The incidents started amid a divisive presidential campaign last fall and went on long after Election Day, even as the district’s top leader called the acts unacceptable and warned of disciplinary action. More than 25 schools reported problems, including graffiti saying “Brown people suck” and “Heil Hitler.” Images of swastikas appeared on desks, walls, mirrors, a laptop computer and a high school football field.

“The swastika – a symbol of intolerance and hatred – has absolutely no place in our school,” Louise Worthington, the principal at Baker Middle School in Damascus, Maryland, wrote to parents in one of many such letters that went home from county schools in recent months.

Documenting Hate Share your stories of hate crimes and discrimination with The Denver Post and ProPublica through the nationwide Documenting Hate project.

While the incidents have affected just a fraction of the county’s 204 schools, they have sparked concern among leaders who are proud of Montgomery’s diverse population and progressive policies.

Police data shows that bias incidents across the community have soared more than 80 percent for the first half of this year compared with the same period last year – with 68 incidents, up from 37. Among them were three noose incidents, including one in Montgomery Village in June, and anti-gay vandalism.

But police say nearly 43 percent of bias incidents they investigated during the past six months were related to schools.

“We believe some of that increase can be attributed to an increase in awareness,” said Officer Rick Goodale, a county police spokesman. “Many people are calling us to report things they may not have in the past.”

Bias incidents have been on the rise nationally, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which documented more than 1,800 between Nov. 9 and March 31 and said it has never been so inundated with reports. The center found that the most frequent reports were anti-immigrant, followed by anti-black, anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim acts.

Montgomery school officials say they won’t have exact figures on incidents until late fall or early winter. A year earlier, the district recorded 10 such incidents, according to a school district report. The year before that, six were reported. In 2013-2014, it was two.

The causes of the spike are under study, said schools spokesman Derek Turner, but the district has been seeking to address the problem.

“Regardless of the reason for the increase, we know the solution is conversations with our students addressing issues of racism, bigotry and hate head-on,” he said, noting that such discussions have taken many forms during the past school year.

Jack Smith, Montgomery County’s schools superintendent, has denounced such conduct, calling it unlawful, disturbing and “simply wrong.”

Patricia O’Neill, a longtime county school board member, said that this year’s surge is shocking but that it is also possible schools are reporting more of what they encounter – which she would welcome. “It’s hard to wrap our arms around how big a problem it is if it’s not reported,” she said.

A majority of hate incidents were in high schools and middle schools, information from police and schools shows. District officials say that offenders were sometimes tough to identify – especially in instances of restroom graffiti – but that when possible, they were disciplined.

Winston Churchill High School in Potomac stood out among schools, with at least five incidents. In November, a “Whites only” sign was posted on a restroom door. Later, someone wrote a racial epithet and “Heil Hitler” on a desk. There were two cases of swastikas in restrooms, and an anti-Semitic text message was sent to a student.

Churchill Principal Joan Benz did not respond to a request for comment. In a message to the school community on March 9, she wrote, “We must stand together to stop these devastating hate-based incidents.”

Some in Montgomery suggest there are more school offenses than the numbers reflect.

The Rev. Mansfield Kaseman, the county’s interfaith community liaison, said that in his experience many school incidents don’t get reported and that many minority and immigrant families are reluctant to come forward. Faith leaders are working with families to encourage more reporting and with the school system on issues of hate-based bullying, he said.

“We know it’s a more serious issue than most people think, deserving of more serious attention from the faith community as well as the school system,” he said.

The district launched an arts competitionin March to spur student projects focused on combating hate – an idea partly inspired by a video called “The Lie,” created by fourth-graders at Stedwick Elementary School in Montgomery Village. More than 200 student teams entered, with 35 emerging as winners in different categories.

Educators also have taken on initiatives school by school. At Westland Middle in Bethesda, a candlelight vigil was organized as students, parents and staff reeled from vandalism involving swastikas and came together to show that it did not reflect their school.

At Damascus High, former principal Jenn Webster said she decided to tackle issues of diversity and inclusion through “study circles,” used as a way to build relationships and spark tough conversations on race, religion and culture.

Webster went large with the idea – doing it schoolwide for two full days in June.

Daniel Bidwick, 17, a rising senior at Damascus High, said the candor made a difference. He recalled students opening up to tell stories about difficult times in their lives that made them who they are – and leaving others so touched they wiped away tears.

“I think it helped kids become more open to situations, and understand you don’t know what people have gone through or are going through and everybody has a story,” he said.

Some families have not been happy with the way their schools have handled such issues. At Roberto Clemente Middle School in Germantown, one student recalled becoming dispirited by anti-Semitic remarks and bigoted comments about race and sexual orientation made by other students. She said the problem was “a constant issue,” even after it was raised.

The school had sent a letter to parents in February reporting “multiple incidents of students making bigoted remarks,” with the principal describing the conduct as unacceptable and promising that the school would do more to educate students and convey expectations.

Ron Halber, executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington, called on school district leaders to take more forceful action. Denouncements are important, he said, but there must be a greater emphasis on educating students about diversity and bias on a monthly or quarterly basis to “hammer it in.” Punishments should be public and severe, he said.

“There can’t be any tolerance for this,” he said. “No student should ever feel uncomfortable learning in a classroom setting or not feel safe on school property because of who they are or their background.”

The broader issue has sparked community-driven efforts.

In April, nearly 50 community groups in the county launched Communities United Against Hate, a nonprofit organization supporting those affected by hate and discrimination. The group is planning a fall conference to discuss hate in schools.

“We hope to bring the discussion to the forefront,” said David Lee, one of the leaders. “I think with the increased incidents, students especially will be able to find a place to discuss what’s happening in schools in an open setting and get support and resources.”",1
"Hate in America, especially for African Americans, is living every day. Even though its concealed most of the time, even though people hide their faces and will say things about you and when they see you they smile to your face -- its alive every single day, James said.",1
"When anti-gay and anti-Semitic graffiti and other vandalism was first discovered at Arlington High School earlier this month, it didn’t take long for news to spread.

Olivia Weiss, a senior, found out through a friend. It was scary to hear as a young member of the Jewish community that there had been a swastika painted on my school.

Weiss didnt see the images firsthand. But she says she didn’t have to rely on the rumor mill at school for long. She said the principal sent out a pretty long email to all of the students about what happened.

In the past, schools may have quietly cleaned up the graffiti so as not to draw attention to the incident. But that’s changing.

Statistics show vandalism like the kind that occurred at Arlington High is becoming more common in schools across the state, and as this trend continues, school leaders are now exploring new ways to handle and prevent these crimes.

Robert Trestan, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, said schools are opting for more transparency and quick communication with the community.

When they see hate more and more, he said, people are recognizing it as something that needs to be dealt with promptly and in an upfront manner.

In 2017, the Anti-Defamation League counted about 90 anti-Semitic incidents in Massachusetts schools — up from about 50 in 2016.

State data on hate crimes tell a similar story. In 2016, about 18 percent of all hate crimes occurred in schools -- an increase from about 12 percent the year before.

Education is the best prevention tool that we have, Trestan said. A growing number of districts, according to Trestan, have been integrating anti-bias curriculum into their classes. Organizations like the Anti-Defamation League and the NAACP are partnering with schools to develop and implement these programs, which Trestan said are in high demand.

In the course of a two-year period, we’re adding over 50 schools to our program, he said. That’s a significant increase, but it’s also a reflection of what is happening out there in the community.

The Franklin Public School district is among those adopting such programs. According to the districts superintendent, Sara Ahern, the schools saw three incidents of racist vandalism in 2017 alone.

We’ve had a couple of swastikas located in our bathrooms, she said, as well as a few on our playground structures, or on sidewalks displayed in chalk.

The district has so far launched an anti-bias curriculum for middle-schoolers. Instead of relying solely on teachers though, Ahern said the program has students lead conversations and develop inclusive environments. School leaders now hope to expand the program to high-schoolers.

We see this type of anti-bias work in our diverse culture as being very intricately connected to developing social and emotional skills that will leave students more prepared to go out into the world, she said.

In the wake of the discovery of anti-gay and anti-Semitic graffiti at Arlington High School earlier this month, students posted messages of love and inclusion in chalk on school walls. (Courtesy Olivia Weiss)

Back at Arlington High School, school officials were not the only ones responding to the vandalism. Students took to school grounds with chalk to post messages of inclusion on sidewalks and walls. Others, like Olivia Weiss, have also started fundraising.

I want this to be a message to the Arlington community as a whole, anyone who felt affected by what happened, that we’re kind of all in this together, Weiss said. And we all have the opportunity to do something good.

The money will be donated to the Friends of Arlington High School Fund where Weiss said she hopes it will be used for efforts that promote healing instead of division.",1
"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton discussed her commitment to the middle class at three Los Angeles-area fundraisers today amid criticism from both the Republican National Committee and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The fundraisers were closed to reporters, like most fundraisers for presidential candidates. An aide who asked not to be identified said Clinton discussed her commitment to build on the progress made under President Barack Obama, her fights to break down the barriers holding people back, including any American who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, sexism and discrimination against the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. The Republican National Committee released a web video of comments made in 2008 by Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, critical of Obama, who she was running against for the Democratic presidential nomination, and slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. The video ends with a picture of the Clintons accompanied by the words, The Clintons: Only with you, when they need you. A tweet from campaign account of Sanders, who is running against Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, noted its been 17 days, 16 hours and 32 minutes since @HillaryClinton said she would look into releasing her paid speeches to Wall Street. There was no immediate response from the Clinton campaign to the video and tweet. Clinton began her seventh visit to Southern California since declaring her candidacy with a $1,000 per-person fundraiser at the Studio City home of Elizabeth Hirsh Naftali where individuals donating $2,700 had a photo taken with Clinton. Individuals raising $10,000 or couples contributing $5,400 to Clintons primary campaign had photos taken with the former first lady and became members of the Hillary for America Finance Committee, according to an invitation obtained by City News Service. The maximum individual contribution under federal law for a candidate seeking a partys presidential nomination is $2,700. The 68-year-old Clinton then attended a $2,700-per-person fundraiser at the SLS Hotel on Los Angeles-Beverly Hills border. Clintons final event was an evening reception in Hancock Park. Individuals raising $10,000 were co-hosts of the event and had a photo taken with Clinton. Individuals raising $27,000 had photos taken with Clinton, received a ticket to a host reception and became members of the Hillary for America Finance Committee. The fundraiser was held at the home of Jon Vein, the chief strategy officer and a co-founder of MarketShare, which describes itself as the worlds leading analytics technology provider for major brand marketers, and his wife, Ellen Goldsmith-Vein, a movie producer. Approximately 320 people attended the Studio City fundraiser while the SLS Hotel event drew approximately 175 people. Mayor Eric Garcetti was among the approximately 300 people at the Hancock Park event. The Southland fundraisers are part of a two-day California fundraising swing for Clinton, which began Sunday with three events in Northern California, according to the website politicalpartytime.org, which tracks political fundraisers. Clinton held 17 fundraisers during her previous visits to the Southland since declaring her candidacy on April 12. Clinton also participated in a roundtable discussion with a group of home care providers, appeared on the ABC late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live and helped introduce the Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders for Hillary initiative in her past Southland visits during this campaign cycle.

"Its been a difficult year for the LGBTQ community. A Vice President with a horrific record of queer rights, Trumps withdrawal of transgender bathroom protections, not to mention the general galvanization of hate made possible by the current political climate. Its a scary time for queer folk. But Pride is here. And its important that you still celebrate.

In part, because its so important to give a voice for the very voices being threatened by this administration. There has been a huge momentum behind trans issues and acceptance recently — and we cant let the political climate put a stop to that. The transgender movement is finally finding its voice after decades of suppression and oppression from heteronormative society, author and activist Kelsie Brynn Jones tells Bustle, and even exclusion by the mainstream gay organizations of the past. All the more reason why we should be out celebrating and supporting the movement. In the face of the current administration.

And its not just that, we need to remember the roots of Pride, remember Stonewall, and think about just how far weve come. We cant let anything get in the way of that.

Because There Will Always Be Something

Unfortunately, its not the first or last time Pride has been hampered by current events. Even last year, in some places Pride felt subdued. I went to my first London Pride not long after the horrific Pulse Orlando attack, where 49 people were killed and 53 others were wounded. This hate crime gave Pride a sort of bittersweet feel. But people still celebrated. They still danced. They resisted and the defied. It may have been with heavy hearts, but they still danced.

The political climate and the current events, may make Pride subdued, but its also what makes it so important. Unfortunately, hostility toward the queer community and even hate crimes are not uncommon. That doesnt mean we should be blasé, it means that we need to be all the more resistant, demonstrative, and celebratory. It means singing loud enough and dancing wildly enough to give a massive eff-you to the very people who threaten and endanger our lives and happiness. It means making it so crystal clear that love wins.

Which means that not only should you not let politics hamper your pride, it means that we need to draw together even stronger. It means that groups often on the outskirts of the queer community — like bisexuals and trans folks— need to be welcomed with opened arms. It means allies need to fight harder and stronger. Because there is enough hate and division happening outside of the queer communities, enough threats to everyone. We need to band together in the face of it.

Its easy to let the political climate get you down. Its causing real stress and it sucks. So experience those emotions, let yourself be upset and angry and frustrated. But take a day to celebrate, to be joyful. And to do it all in the face of them.",1
"NEW YORK, NY — The New York City Police Department joins residents from across the boroughs in wearing denim on Denim Day NYC, an annual movement supported by a coalition of survivors, advocates, community organizations, city council members and city agencies working together to raise awareness about sexual assault. The seventh annual Denim Day NYC rally and press conference kicked off April 26 at 11 a.m. at Lower Manhattans Foley Square, located at 111 Worth St. and was promoted on social media using the hashtag #iamnotinvisible.   According to the Denim Day website, the event launched in 2010 as a response to a 1998 Italian Supreme Court ruling that overturned a rape conviction because the victim wore tight jeans. But the Denim Day NYC organizers herald a singular message: Assault is never about what you wear. A Denim Day NYC march is scheduled to begin at 4:45 p.m in the Bronx. Marchers will meet at the corner of Grand Concourse and Mount Eden Parkway at 4:15 p.m. and make their way to the Bronx Museum. Participants will include the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Centers Department of Pediatrics, the Bronx Museum of the Arts and the New Settlement Program for Girls and Young Women, among others.

"AURORA, IL —A six-year-old Cicero boy is in critical condition after the SUV his mom was driving spun out of control and into a retention pond near I-88 and Diehl Road early Sunday. The boy was trapped underwater for at least 30 minutes before rescue divers found him. The driver, 31, and three other passengers, aged 21, 15, and 12, all female, of Cicero, were able to escape the submerged Nissan XTerra unharmed. Aurora Police and emergency crews arrived on the scene at approximately 2:40 a.m. A surface swimmer and two Water Rescue Team divers entered the pond to search for the boy and the drivers SUV. After about six minutes, divers found the boy and the SUV 15 feet of water roughly 80 feet from the shore and rescued the boy just after 3 a.m. He was rushed to a hospital in Aurora and later transferred to a Chicago hospital, according to police. The driver told police they had just left a party in Aurora and were on their way back to Cicero when the accident occurred. In a Facebook post, police said alcohol use is thought to be the main factor in the crash, but have yet to determine if the stormy weather played a role. The driver is currently being held at the Aurora Police Department and official charges are expected to be released Monday. >>Image via Pixabay",0

"JASPER COUNTY, TX (KTRE) - A prisoner on Texas death row for the dragging death of a man nearly two decades ago in East Texas has lost a federal court appeal, moving him a step close to execution for the hate crime.

Evidence showed the 49-year-old Byrd was chained by his ankles to the back of a pickup truck and dragged along a road outside Jasper in East Texas. Prosecutors said Byrd was killed simply because he was black. Attorneys for King argued his trial lawyers were deficient. The 5th Circuit disagreed.

The student was arrested at the high school on Wednesday after school and booked into the King County Juvenile Detention Center, according to the Police Department. The school district reported to police that the 15-year-old told another student that he would harm other students and the school, according to Mercer Island Police spokeswoman Cmdr. Leslie Burns. The threat was general in nature, and not directed toward any particular student or individual, she said. The school district exercised extraordinary caution and placed the student on emergency removal pending a police investigation of the incident, Burns said. Mercer Island Police Officers and Detectives responded to the school and contacted the student. The incident took place after school on an early release day, and the police were called around 3 p.m., Burns said. Since it occurred after school, there was no need for a lockdown or evacuation, she said. Burns said that the incident is unusual on the Mercer Island. We havent responded recently to a threat of this nature, she said. The school takes the safety of students very seriously.

"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — The man accused of plowing a car into a crowd of people protesting a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing a woman and injuring dozens more, now faces federal hate crime charges.

The Department of Justice announced that an indictment returned Wednesday charges James Alex Fields Jr., 21, of Maumee, Ohio, with 30 crimes, including one count of a hate crime resulting in the death of Heather Heyer, and 28 other hate crimes involving an attempt to kill dozens of other people who were injured. Another charge accuses him of racially motivated violent interference with a federally protected activity.

Last summers violence in Charlottesville cut short a promising young life and shocked the nation, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. Todays indictment should send a clear message to every would-be criminal in America that we aggressively prosecute violent crimes of hate that threaten the core principles of our nation.

Authorities have said Fields, described by a former teacher as having a keen interest in Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler, drove his speeding car into a group of people demonstrating against the Unite the Right rally Aug. 12 that drew hundreds of white nationalists to the college town, where officials planned to remove a Confederate monument.

Fields already faces state charges including first-degree murder and is set to face a jury trial later this year. He has been in custody since the rally. The attorney representing Fields on those counts declined comment Wednesday.

The car attack came after the rally had descended into chaos — with violent brawling between attendees and counterdemonstrators — and authorities had forced the crowd to disband.

The eight-page indictment alleges Fields decided to attend the rally on or before Aug. 8. As he prepared to leave to travel to Charlottesville, a family member sent him a text message urging him to be careful, the indictment said.

Fields replied, Were not the ones who need to be careful, and attached an image of Hitler, according to the indictment, which also says Fields used social media to promote racist views.

Fields then attended the rally Aug. 12, engaging in chants promoting white supremacist and other racist and anti-Semitic views, the indictment said.

After authorities forced the crowd to disband, Fields drove his car toward the area where a racially and ethnically diverse crowd had gathered to protest, the indictment said.

Fields rapidly accelerated, through a stop sign and across a raised pedestrian mall, and drove directly into the crowd, it said.

In a statement, FBI Special Agent in Charge Adam S. Lee of the Richmond Division thanked the business owners and Charlottesville residents who he said worked with us and provided a massive volume of evidence in this case.

The federal civil rights case is not the first under Sessions Justice Department, but it is certainly the most high-profile one. Critics of Sessions for the last year have been concerned about what they see as less aggressive enforcement of federal civil rights laws, and especially the Justice Departments lack of intervention against local police agencies with troubled relationships with minorities.

But in bringing the prosecution, Sessions appeared to assert himself as independent from President Donald Trump — who blamed the violence on both sides and was accused of emboldening racists — and suggested that the Justice Department would continue to treat racially motivated acts of violence as hate crimes.",1

ROCHESTER, N.Y. (WROC-TV) - Governor Andrew Cuomo wants New York State to take action after the violent demonstrations which turned deadly in Charlottesville, Va.

The Governor announced Tuesday he will be advancing legislation to add inciting to riot and rioting that targets protected classes to the states hate crimes law.

The Governor hopes that these changes, known as the Charlottesville provisions, will reaffirm that while peaceful demonstrations are allowed, New York will never tolerate advocacy or the incitement of imminent violence against protected classes within our communities.

The penalty for engaging in rioting would be increased from an E felony to a D felony and inciting to riot would be increased from an A misdemeanor to an E felony.

The ugly events that took place in Charlottesville must never be repeated, and in New York were going to stand united against hate in all of its forms, Governor Cuomo said. Our diversity is our strength and this legislation will help protect New Yorkers and send a clear signal that violence and discrimination have no place in our society. New York is one community and one family, and we will never stop fighting to ensure the safety and equal treatment of all New Yorkers.

Gov. Cuomo is also asking for the Human Rights Law in New York State to be expanded to protect all students.

Currently the law only protects private school students and, if a student from a public school is discriminated against, they dont have a claim.",1
"This article may contain triggers for victims of hate crimes.

Trans actress Laverne Cox emphasized on Sunday that jokes about violence towards trans people can be seriously dangerous for the community, responding to a viral clip of stand-up comic Lil Duval saying he would “kill” a trans woman if he discovered he had sex with her.

“Some folks think it’s ok to joke about wanting to kill us,” Cox wrote on her Twitter account Sunday. “We have free speech but that speech has consequences and trans folks are experiencing the negative consequences with our lives. It hurts my spirit cause this isn’t funny. Our lives matter. Trans murder isn’t a joke.”

Activists and allies for the trans community are upset after Lil Duval’s remarks from a Friday “Breakfast Club” interview went viral over the weekend. In the interview, host DJ Envy asked Lil Duval what his reaction would be if he found out he slept with a trans woman.

“This might sound messed up and I don’t care: she dying,” Duval told the radio show’s three hosts.

Duval also told the hosts that when it comes to transgender women, “that ain’t a girl, that’s a boy.” He told the hosts that he felt there should be repercussions for that type of “manipulation” but until then, Duval would have his own. When host Charlamagne Tha God jumped in and tried to tell the comedian he couldn’t go around killing trans women, Duval made an poor clarification.

“I didn’t say I was gonna kill transgenders,” Duval attempted to backtrack. “I said, if one did that to me, and they didn’t tell me, I’mma be so mad I’d probably kill them.”

After taking several deep breaths I just got teary thinking about all my sisters experiencing violence, beaten, raped, murdered and some https://t.co/QyNXp11ysL — Laverne Cox (@Lavernecox) July 30, 2017

Host Angela Yee told him he should be “politically correct,” but Duval responded, saying that comedians shouldn’t have to be.

“That’s the good thing I like about being me,” he said. “I can say what I want and do what I want and people understand where I’m coming from. They understand I’m not coming from a place of malice. They know I’m just speaking my mind.”

Duval acknowledged on Sunday the growing backlash on his Twitter account, but refused to apologize or address the trending hashtag, #BoycottBreakfastClub.

A few days prior, the show brought Janet Mock on to discuss her role in the transgender community and educate listeners on her journey. Mock told the hosts about her previous partners, her childhood, and what makes being transgender different to sexual identity.

“So for me, it wasn’t about feeling I was attracted to men or being attracted to masculinity, it was about my own embodiment about how I wanted to show up, not just in bed but also in the world,” Mock told the hosts. “It was before I even had any consciousness of sexuality. I wasn’t thinking about being attracted to boys.”",1
"Details have emerged in the child predator undercover sting operation that was carried out over the weekend by former To Catch a Predator personality Chris Hansen in cooperation with the Fairfield Police Department and the States Attorneys Office.

Four teens in Maryland were charged with hate crimes after spray-painting racist graffiti at their high school last week, The Baltimore Sun reports.

Police arrested four senior students from Howard County, Maryland: Seth Taylor of Ellicott City; Tyler Curtiss of Brookeville; Joshua Shaffer of Mt. Airy; and Matthew Lipp of Woodbine. The four students are all 18 years old.

Workers at the Glenelg High School discovered the graffiti and reported it to the school resource officer, who recognized the four from a surveillance video that showed them spray painting, according to police in a statement.

The graffiti, which is racist, anti-Semitic and anti-LGBT, was found on the walls and sidewalks of the school. They also wrote that the school’s black principal, David Burton, was a “n***er.”

Dr. Michael Martirano, the Howard County Public School Superintendent, said they denounce “any type of hate” at a press conference last Thursday. “A hate crime against so many of our communities and goes completely against the values we share as a community,” he adds.

Authorities said that the suspects face “multiple counts of destruction of property based on race, color, religious belief, sexual orientation, or national origin.” They were booked at the Howard County Detention Center.

"Gay soccer fans are more than just intimated by chants being yelled at games, they are downright scared of them.

OutSports reports that two fans; one from Oklahoma, the other from San Diego left the games not only discouraged but emotionally scarred after being subject to homophobic verbal abuse.

The Spanish term “puto” is equivalent to the epithet “fag” in English and it seems to be thrown around freely at sporting events in the U.S. not only in the stands, but for one anonymous San Diego resident, in the parking lot at QualComm Stadium this past Sunday.

“I wore my USA soccer jersey with rainbow numbers that US Soccer sold for Pride month to the match. After having a group of 30 or so Mexico fans coordinate a “puto” chant directly at us in the parking lot, I was afraid to turn around in my seat or look around the stands for fear of making eye contact with the wrong person. Thinking about it makes me particularly emotional because I was attending with tickets I purchased through the San Diego naval base MWR office. I just returned from a trip to visit my husband stationed in the Middle East earlier this year where we constantly had to be vigilant about how we acted toward one another and who was around us. That’s not an experience I ever expected to have in 2017 America, much less California. But that’s the experience I relived again on Sunday.”

Earlier this year, the Mexican Football Federation appealed fines brought on by FIFA for using the slur. It’s reported that the language has transcended from soccer games and into other arenas such as NFL games.

The fan from Oklahoma has his own ideas about curbing the behavior:

“This chant is a part of Mexican soccer culture in general. Its engrained in their ways and its something that only changes when BIG steps are taken to combat it. A simple message about equality and inclusion by CONCACAF before a match or empty threats by both CONCACAF and FIFA arent enough. This issue goes much deeper into Mexican soccer culture than most people realize. Start putting real pressure on them. Start having them play matches in empty stadiums. If they are at an away fixture and their fans continue the chant, call the game and count it as a loss for the team. Until real measures are taken that show just how serious of an issue this is, nothing will change. Its time for FIFA and CONCACAF to step up and really play ball. Until they do, sadly, nothing will change.

The chant, when used in soccer games, is meant to intimidate an opposing goalkeeper taking a goal kick.",1
"A 20-year-old man has been sentenced to five years in prison after pleading no contest Tuesday to felony assault charges after shooting a drug dealer in Daly City during a narcotics transaction gone wrong last year. Jordan Manuel Perez met with the 24-year-old victim near a residence on Vendome Avenue on Aug. 24, 2016. When an argument broke out, Perez pulled out a gun and shot the dealer once in the abdomen before fleeing the scene, prosecutors said. The victim wasnt initially cooperative, but eventually allowed detectives to search his phone and they identified Perez as a suspect. The victim eventually identified Perez during a photo lineup. He pleaded no contest to felony assault with a firearm charges, admitting also to an enhancement for the infliction of great bodily injury. Perez is going in to his five-year sentence with 546 days credit for time served.

"A man in San Francisco, California has been arrested by local authorities for targeting multiple Asian women in a series of attacks that have been classified as a hate crime.

The suspect identified as 19-year-old Agustin Garcia, is now under the custody of San Francisco police. He is facing a hate crime allegation and felony charges of assault with force likely to cause great bodily injury, battery with serious injuries, terrorist threats, and attempted kidnapping.

Officers from the Bayview precinct of the SFPD launched its investigation in August after a series of attacks targeting only Asian women occurred in San Bruno and Silver Avenues, San Bruno and Arleta Avenues, and San Bruno and Egbert Avenues.

Police said that Garcia lives in the area where the attacks happened.

Based on SFPD’s investigation, one of the victims suffered a nose fracture and a massive laceration that needed seven stitches. Another victim reportedly got her tooth broken.



In one of the attacks, Garcia was found to have followed one of his victims off the San Francisco Muni platform.

On Saturday, the police released a video of one of the attacks showing the suspect brutally assaulting an Asian woman without provocation, CBS reports.

In the short clip, multiple angles show Garcia following a woman along a sidewalk in San Francisco on August 10. Garcia can be seen temporarily halting and hiding behind a power pole before continuing the chase of his victim.

"By definition, a hate crime is any offense motivated solely or majorly by prejudice or bias based upon race, gender, creed and so forth. For example, take the white couple who terrorized an 8-year-old Black boy with Confederate flags and racial slurs. Or the Black Bowie State University student stabbed to death by a white student who is dually a member of a white supremacist Facebook group.

But according to a white security guard who alleges that Young Money mogul Lil Wayne committed one against him, all it takes is being called a “white boy” to qualify for such a violation.",1

Adam Purinton also pleaded guilty Tuesday to two counts of attempted premeditated murder.

Witnesses said Purinton, who is white, yelled get out of my country before shooting Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani at Austins Bar and Grill in Olathe, Kansas.

"Story highlights Zackary Randalls was shot dead Tuesday in what police are calling a hate crime

He wouldnt want this to turn into any type of hateful reaction from anybody in the public, his longtime best friend said

(CNN) Zackary Randalls kids will know their father. That is the promise that Eddie Valencia is making to his best friend of 15 years, one of three white men shot dead Tuesday in Fresno, California, in what police are calling a hate crime.

We all have a different piece of him, a different relationship, and knew him at different times of his life, Valencia said, overcome with grief and barely able to speak. They will know their father, he said of Randalls 3-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son.

Valencia said he was the one to tell Randalls wife that her husband had died after he heard about it on social media.

He would do the same thing for me, he told CNNs Brooke Baldwin on Wednesday, just one day after his friends death.

Wearing an LA Dodgers baseball cap in honor of Randalls, a longtime Dodgers fan, Valencia described his friend as the best, a man who loved his two kids with everything that he had.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the creation of the subcommittee last week as part of the DOJs Task Force on Crime Reduction and Public Safety. The subcommittee will develop a plan to appropriately address hate crimes, according to a DOJ memo dated April 5.

In the memo, which was sent to U.S. attorney’s offices and DOJ department heads, Sessions wrote, “We must also protect the civil rights of all Americans, and we will not tolerate threats or acts of violence targeting any person or community in this country on the basis of their religious beliefs or background.

Three days before the announcement, 13 U.S. senators led by Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) called on the Trump Administration to create a task force in response to increasing hate violence and threats against racial and religious minorities.

“Across the United States, we have seen hate violence and threats against religious and racial minorities become more and more commonplace,” Sen. Cantwell said in a statement. “These crimes and threats of violence fly in the face of our core values of tolerance, respect, and freedom of religion,”

Muhammad was arrested on Tuesday shortly after the deadly morning rampage that left several dead according to police. (Fresno Police Department)

Kori Muhammad, the man accused of killing four men in a racially charged shooting in Fresno, California, said he was motivated by injustices committed against black people – in a phone call from jail to reporters.

“Someone has to fight for them,” he told KGPE. “Someone has to fight for all the people who died at the hands of racist white men.”

Police officials called the shootings a hate crime.

In the call, Muhammad cites the Flint Water Crisis and the crack cocaine epidemic, “and all the injustice and the tragedy my people go through as the reasons he didnt turn himself after first shooting an unarmed security guard at a Motel 6.



He said he considered turning himself in before going on a shooting spree motivated by those who benefit from white supremacy.

Prosecutors said he will undergo a mental competency evaluation next month.

So they were nervous. You could tell they were new to this, she told Channel 4. Rochin said the culprits got away with several hundred dollars and three cell phones. The heist left employees traumatized. She said one of the female employees was just sick to her stomach. She was just throwing up and it was a mess.

In my office, we have made it a priority to treat sex offenses involving child victims very seriously, and will seek appropriate, and significant, sentences for those crimes, he said.

"Governor Andrew Cuomo spent his Sunday in Israel, going on a one-day whirlwind trip through Jerusalem. State House reporter Zack Fink was the only local TV journalist to travel there with the governor and he filed this report.

Beginning his day at the Holocaust memorial, Yad Vesham in Jerusalem, Governor Cuomo laid a wreath to honor the victims.

Cuomo chose to come to Israel at a time when hate crimes, threats and anti-Semitism are on the rise in America and in New York.

We must live by the rule that an affront to one is an affront to all, Cuomo said. And that large fires start as small fires. And we must have zero tolerance for discrimination.

The second part of the trip was economic development. Using the springboard of standing with Israel, Cuomo looked to foster business ties between New York and the Jewish state.

After a luncheon with Israeli business leaders, Cuomo held a formal press conference where he addressed talk that he is considering running for president in 2020.

Its unfortunate in many ways because it suggests that a political nature to everything which frankly fuels cynicism about the whole process, Cuomo said.

On Sunday afternoon, Cuomo toured Jerusalems old city, and even left a message at the holy Western Wall. He also had an opportunity to meet with Israeli police who have an extensive video surveillance system to keep Jerusalem safe.

They have here a much more intense camera system, Cuomo said. What we do in New York is we tend to put together footage from private cameras that are in private buildings after the fact. They have their own camera system.

For the final leg of his tour, the Governor held an hour-long meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Cuomo spoke to us exclusively about that meeting just before boarding a plane and heading back to New York.

We set this trip up in two days the Prime Minister changes his schedule, the president of this, Cuomo said. Putney changes his schedule. The minister of defense could not have been any better during the meeting the police. So they were very happy that we were here.

This is the second time Cuomo came to Israel as Governor, the first was in 2014.",1
"PORTLAND, Ore. ― It’s easy to understand why Imam Mikal Shabazz doesn’t feel like Portland always loves people who look like him.

He remembers when cops choked an unarmed black man to death and then distributed T-shirts bragging about it. He lived here when a gang of neo-Nazis brutally murdered an Ethiopian student on the street. And he was here during the Northwest Imperative movement, when white supremacists moved to the Pacific Northwest to set up a white Utopia, terrorizing cities like Portland.

“All of that wasn’t too long ago in my time, on my calendar,” said Shabazz, 66. Portland, he said, shouldn’t think of that kind of terror as distant history. It’s very much still happening.

Amanda Lucier for HuffPost Imam Mikal Shabazz poses for a portrait at the Muslim Community Center of Portland, Oregon, on May 30, 2017.

Last Friday, a white supremacist stabbed three men on the MAX train, two fatally, as they tried to protect a black teenage girl and her Muslim friend from his bigoted, anti-Muslim threats.

The murders grabbed national headlines with many asking: Portland? That liberal, progressive city in a blue state?

What people forget is that Portland is in Oregon, a “white state where most white people almost never interact with people of color,” Shabazz said.

“At the same time, there’s always been some of us here,” he added, referring to himself and other minorities.

Shabazz is an imam at the Muslim Community Center of Portland, which has almost completed a new one-story mosque just a few miles northeast of where the stabbing occurred. On Tuesday afternoon during Ramadan, the Muslim holy month dedicated to fasting and reflection, the sounds of construction could be heard inside the mosque as a typical soft Northwest rain fell outside.

When one of the contractors there to install a security system walked through the prayer room with his shoes on ― a no-no at mosques ― one of the parishioners asked him kindly to take them off.

“I’m not taking them off,” the contractor, a lumbering middle-aged white man, replied sternly.

Shabazz defused the situation, like he always does, and said, “It’s okay. We’ll clean it up. We’ve done it before.”

Amanda Lucier for HuffPost Imam Mikal Shabazz, right, and his brother Omar Shabazz, right, talk at the Muslim Community Center of Portland on May 30, 2017.

Portland, depicted in recent years as a quirky progressive urban Eden ― especially in the TV show “Portlandia” ― has a long history of racism. In the wake of Friday’s murders, America has rediscovered the city as a haven for hate, while local leaders like Shabazz try to reassure a very frightened community.

A State Founded In Hate

Oregon’s history reads like a timeline of white supremacy. Its indigenous peoples were massacred. The state’s original constitution had a complete ban on blacks living in the state. It became a home to thousands of KKK members in the 1920s. It was the scene of Japanese-American incarceration during World War II. In the Jim Crow era, whites-only signs adorned storefronts just as they did in the South. This history created conditions ripe for the evolution of a robust neo-Nazi culture in the 1980s and ‘90s.

“In the eyes of a skinhead, Portland, Oregon, looks like the city of the future,” Time magazine wrote about the movement in 1993. The article went on to describe the Northwest Imperative, which drew hundreds of white supremacists to the region to found a whites-only city.

David S. Holloway/Getty Images Jacob Laskey, left, and another skinhead member of Volksfront from Oregon, show off their tattoos while attending the 2003 Aryan Nations World Congress held on June 22, 2003 in Hayden, Idaho.

Eric Ward, a longtime civil rights strategist and program officer for the Ford Foundation, lived in Oregon during this era and later worked with the Northwest Coalition Against Malicious Harassment. He remembers a constant stream of terror back then, he said. Organized neo-Nazi groups repeatedly attacked minorities.

One such example was in November 1988, when members of East Side White Pride beat 28-year-old graduate student Mulugeta Seraw to death with a baseball bat.

Now, Ward says, it feels like it’s happening all over again.

He says whenever people talk to him about Portland, they always ask about “Portlandia.”

“They want to know if it’s true and is it really that quirky? Is it really that progressive? Is the food amazing? And all of those things are actually true.”

But, Ward continued, “there’s another ‘Portlandia,’ and the other ‘Portlandia’ isn’t funny. It is a ‘Portlandia’ that has a white terror crisis.”

White Terror All Over Again

Zane Sparling/Portland Tribune An Iranian refugee in Troutdale, Oregon, near Portland, returned to his home in March 2017 to find it covered in anti-Muslim graffiti and death threats.

A series of horrifying hate crimes have occurred over the last year and a half in the Portland area. Earlier this month, a Latino family found both of their cars’ windshields smashed in. In one of the cars was an explosive device. Their neighbor’s car was also vandalized and contained a note that said, “#Trump AT ICE—See you soon—Sorry bout that—Sorry not sorry.”

In March, an Iranian refugee returned home to find a slew of anti-Muslim death threats written in all caps all over his house. “Terrorist” was written on the kitchen cabinet; “Fuck you terrorist” on a wall; “Muslim” and “Kill you” in the bedroom; “Die” on a mirror; and “Hate” on a door.

The day after the presidential election, just east of Portland, three men hit a black woman with a brick and beat her. One of the men reportedly said, “We got a president who finally feels how we feel and we’re going to make America great again by getting rid of n****rs like you.”

Two months before, a man on a bike pepper-sprayed a black family and screamed a racial slur at them. In the Portland suburb of Gresham, a member of the neo-Nazi prison gang European Kindred ran down a 19-year-old black man with his car, killing him. The list goes on.

There have been other unnerving developments, too: A KKK imperial wizard from Mississippi moved to the area, neo-Nazi fliers and swastikas have proliferated in public spaces, and a then-unknown Nazi-saluting Trump-supporter appeared at a rally earlier this month ― the stabber from Friday.

Randy Blazak, a professor and head of the Oregon Coalition Against Hate Crime, said this resurgence of white supremacist activity is undoubtedly linked to the political climate. White nationalists in Oregon and across the country have cheered Donald Trump’s rise.

The hate “was always there,” Blazak said, “but now it’s been given new permission.”

A City in Crisis

Amanda Lucier for HuffPost An Anti-Fascist, or Antifa, poster outside of a halal market near the Muslim Community Center of Portland on May 30, 2017, advertises training for group self-defense in the streets. Antifa groups are planning on disrupting a rally on June 4 across from Portland City Hall featuring white nationalists and alt-right celebrity Kyle Chapman. Remember those who died fighting on the MAX May 26th, the poster says.

This latest wave of hate is different for a few reasons, Blazak said. It’s less structured than in the ‘80s and ‘90s, a time when he knew the locations of all the skinhead houses around Portland, where the neo-Nazis lived together and partied and fought.

It’s not as cohesive as it was back then, he said. White supremacists are largely radicalized online now, and the hate has a new flavor: It is increasingly directed at Muslims, something that began after 9/11.

“It’s become the convenient bigotry,” he said.

Now he’s nervous about an upcoming event: another alt-right rally on Sunday, where there’s set to be a showdown with sometimes violent anti-fascist protesters. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler has called on the federal government to revoke the protesters’ permit, which provoked the ire of free speech defenders like the American Civil Liberties Union.

A “March Against Sharia” organized by the local chapter of the anti-Muslim hate group Act for America, scheduled for June 10, was canceled after public pressure and relocated to Seattle.

“It’s going to be another long, hot summer,” Blazak said.

To prepare, Imam Shabazz says he’s telling Muslims to be extra vigilant and for women not to leave the mosque unescorted.

Still, he’s also confident that the example set by the heroes on the train last Friday will inspire others to act similarly.

“Their lives certainly have not gone in vain, because now they have triggered in other people the same idea,” Shabazz said. “People can stand up for what’s right and refuse to give in under extraordinary circumstances.”

As the sun set Tuesday night over the Hollywood and 42nd Street station, people from all over Portland stopped by to pay their respects to Ricky John Best, 53, and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, 23 ― who gave their lives protecting their neighbors ― as well as Micah Fletcher, 21, who survived.

Small children drew hearts in chalk on the station’s winding walkway up to the tracks. Adults wrote messages like, “This will not stop us” and “Your sacrifice will ignite change” and “wear your hijab with pride.” A middle-aged man in a suit pulled up in his car, laid down flowers, stood silently for a minute observing the scene and then just as quietly drove off.

A man who appeared down on his luck struggled to find the right words, until finally saying what was on everyone’s mind: “Muslims are good people, man.”

Others lit candles, and looking up at the sprawling memorial in its totality, almost everyone cried.

A young African-American man who would only give his first name, Mike, had tears streaming down his face. His girlfriend, Anna, who is white, hugged and consoled him.

“They were made of steel,” Mike said of the three heroes.

"An Oakdale priest who was charged with sexually assaulting two boys has also been charged with possessing child pornography. Curtis Carl Wehmeyer, 48, was charged earlier this week with 17 counts of possessing child pornography, according to the Pioneer Press. Wehmeyer, who was the former paster of the Parish of the Blessed Sacrament in St. Paul, was also charged in September with three counts of criminal sexual conduct. Wehmeyer will make his first appearance in Ramsey District Court today (Oct. 10) on both charges. The two boys who reported the alleged sexual abuse stated that Wehmeyer would show them pornography on his laptop computer before and during the abuse, the Pioneer Press reports. A St. Paul investigator retrieved the laptop computer from the churchs rectory with a search warrant on July 7. The investigator found three videos and 14 photos depicting sex acts involving prepubescent boys, according to the Pioneer Press.

"Orlando, FL — When Framingham native Angel Colon sat in front of cameras Tuesday describing the terror that unfolded inside the Pulse Orlando nightclub June 12, he lamented not remembering the name and face of the officer who pulled him to safety. That officer, Omar Delagado of Floridas Eatonville Police Department, remembered Colon. So much so, in fact, he paid him a visit at Orlando Regional Medical Center Thursday, where Colon continues to recover after being shot several times in the leg, hand and hip. The emotional reunion, captured on video, was the first time the two had seen each other since the tragedy occurred early Sunday morning. Watch it here: I need a big hug from you, Delgado said to Colon after explaining he was one of the officers who saved him. Im glad youre doing good, man. Colon was the first survivor of Sundays attack to speak out. He described the horror he witnessed as Omar Mateen, 29, fired into the crowded Pulse Orlando Night Club & Ultra Lounge Sunday. The popular gay bar had a near-capacity crowd as Mateen perpetrated what has since been called the largest mass shooting in American history. Classified by the federal government as an act of terror, Mateens rampage left 49 people dead and 53 wounded. It ended when police shot and killed Mateen. Colon recalled already being wounded after being shot three times in the leg. He was on the clubs floor with a shattered leg when Mateen began firing into the bodies of those already dead, he said during a Tuesday press conference. He shoots the girl next to me, Colon said. Im thinking, Im next, Im dead. Mateen fired toward Colons head but hit his hand. He fired again, striking Colon in the hip. As Colon continued to hear shots all around him, he remained very still, hoping to avoid capturing Mateens attention again. Thats when a police officer — whose face and name Colon couldnt remember — came and pulled him to safety. I was so happy, Colon said after meeting Delgado, according to ABC. Ive been wanting to see the man that took me out of that horrible place. YouTube screenshot courtesy of Wochit News",0
"A second Indian man was killed in a series of potentially racially motivated attacks against Indians living in the US on Thursday night.

Harnish Patel, who had lived in the US with his family for 14 years, was shot and killed outside of his home late Thursday night in Lancaster, South Carolina, according to the Lancaster County Sheriffs Office.

The sheriff’s office is still investigating potential motives for the attack, and investigators have not ruled out the possibility that the attack was racially motivated, said staff attorney for the sheriff’s office Doug Barfield. Investigators are still looking for a suspect and have asked anyone with information to share it with them.

But the FBI is currently investigating whether other attacks against Indians in the past few weeks are hate crimes, specifically the attacks against two men in Kansas and against a Sikh man in Kent, Washington, reported the Seattle Times.

These three attacks have deepened the fear among South Asian and immigrant communities that President Donald Trump’s aggressive rhetoric and executive orders encourage violence against them.

“Go back to your country”: the latest on the attacks

Last month, two Indian men were shot in a bar outside of Kansas City after the shooter reportedly yelled, “Get out of my country.” Srinivas Kuchibhotla died in the hospital soon after he was shot. His friend Alok Madasani was injured and was released from the hospital shortly after.

Madasani spoke at a vigil remembering Kuchibhotla four days later. “I wish it was a dream,” Madasani said, as reported by the Kansas City Star. “What happened that night was a senseless crime and that took away my best friend.”

The suspected shooter, Adam W. Purinton, was charged with first-degree murder and two counts of attempted first-degree murder.

On Friday, a 39-year-old Sikh man was shot in Kent, Washington, while he was in his driveway working on his vehicle. Before being shot, the victim, Deep Rai, was also allegedly told to “go back to [his] country.” Rai is recovering in a Washington hospital, according to India’s external affairs minister, Sushma Swaraj.

“I am sorry to know about the attack on Deep Rai a US national of Indian origin. I have spoken to Sardar Harpal Singh father of the victim,” said Swaraj on Twitter. “He told me that his son had a bullet injury on his arm. He is out of danger and is recovering in a private hospital.”

Swaraj also tweeted her condolences to Patel’s family. “I am pained to hear about the killing of Harnish Patel a US national of Indian origin in Lancaster, South Carolina,” said Swaraj.

Some blame Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric for the attacks, but the White House says there’s no connection

Some Indian Americans have blamed Trump’s harsh tone on immigration for the attacks, and fear that Trump’s rhetoric is fueling violent attacks against immigrants. Madasani’s father even warned Indian parents not to send their children to the US with Trump as president shortly after his son was attacked in Kansas.

South Asian Americans Leading Together, a national organization advocating for South Asians, responded to the attack in Washington against Rai, specifically pointing to Trump’s rhetoric, and said the violence was “no surprise given the anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim vitriol escalating across the country, most notably illustrated in President Trump’s divisive recent executive orders.”

“When our ‘so-called’ leaders attempt to govern from an angle of xenophobia, these sentiments embolden deadly violence against our communities,” said Suman Raghunathan, executive director of the organization, in a press release.

But the White House has rejected any link between Trump’s foreign policy and the attacks.

“Obviously, any loss of life is tragic, but I’m not going to get into, like, to suggest that there’s any correlation I think is a bit absurd. So I’m not going to go any further than that,” said White House press secretary Sean Spicer in response to the Kansas shooting.

After being criticized for not commenting on the shooting in Kansas, Trump specifically mentioned Kuchibhotla’s murder nearly a week later during his first address to Congress, saying that the “shooting in Kansas City ... remind us that while we may be a Nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms.”

Trump and the White House have yet to release official statements regarding the Washington and South Carolina shootings.

Even as the White House has denied a connection between the attacks and Trump’s aggressive rhetoric against immigrants, some people still believe the connection is there.

When it happens in your own community, you realize the danger and the times were living in, Raj Singh Ajmani told the Associated Press before attending a gathering at a Sikh temple in Kent. Some people worry that more such violence will occur because of President Trump.",1

"Two women who were originally being charged with arson and a hate crime for allegedly burning a “Make America Great Again” sign had their hate crime and felony charges dropped Thursday.

The two 19-year-old Maryland women, D’Asia R. Perry and Joy M. Shuford, were arrested and charged days ago with second degree arson and hate crime charges after allegedly burning a pro-Donald Trump sign.

These charges have now been dropped, and the two women now face the less severe charges of “malicious burning, trespassing and malicious destruction of property,” the Baltimore-Sun reports.

The original hate crime charges were due to the implication that the burning was done due to the victim’s political beliefs.

In charging the two women, one police officer noted, “The intentional burning of these political signs, along with the beliefs, religious views and race of this political affiliation, directly coincides with the victim.”

Nonetheless, those charges were dropped, due to a decision made by both the Princess Anne Police Department and the Somerset County State’s Attorney’s Office.

"The request is rooted in what the St. Anthony police officers team of attorneys describe as an onslaught of slanted media coverage that has dominated local newspapers and TV coverage since Yanez fatally shot Castile during a traffic stop in Falcon Heights on July 6, according to a legal memo filed late Tuesday seeking a change of venue.

It goes on to suggest that the Blacks Lives Matter protests that followed, as well as comments made by Gov. Mark Dayton, create a formidable hurdle for Yanez to receive a fair trial in the Twin Cities area.

The media coverage and protests have never suggested an iota of fault in Mr. Castiles conduct. That one-sidedness is potentially prejudicial, the memo reads. When viewing coverage as a whole, its too easy for a potential juror to believe Officer Yanez arrived at, and then stepped over, the criminal fault line.

Specifically, the motion says the media has portrayed Castile as an obedient African American male who has been racially profiled his entire life, casting the 32-year-old in a false light while simultaneously suggesting Yanez, who is Latino, was influenced by Castiles race when he made the decision to shoot him.

Judge rejects plea deal for woman who hit young boy with vehicle

SAUK CENTER, MINN.—A judge has rejected a plea agreement in the case of a 42-year-old Sauk Centre woman accused of hitting a 23-month-old toddler with her car while driving drunk in Alexandria.

Becky Lynn Laforge agreed to plead guilty to one of the three charges — criminal vehicular operation of a motor vehicle causing bodily harm while driving with a blood-alcohol level of 0.08 or more within two hours of the crash, which is a gross misdemeanor.

She was willing to serve 30 days in jail and complete a chemical use assessment if the county attorneys office dropped two remaining charges — felony criminal vehicular operation causing substantial bodily harm with a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.08 within two hours of the crash, and third degree driving while under the influence of alcohol, a gross misdemeanor.

Judge Ann Carrott, however, didnt agree with the jail time and didnt accept the plea.

A jury trial is now scheduled to begin May 1 unless an acceptable agreement can be reached before then.

The toddler, Cori Holmes, was struck about 7:30 p.m. on April 23, 2016. When officers arrived, they found the young boy unresponsive in the roadway. He was also having difficulty breathing.

A preliminary breath test indicated Laforge had a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.187, more than twice the legal limit, according to the complaint.

The child was taken to the Douglas County Hospital and later flown to Hennepin County Medical Center because of the severity of his injuries.

Minn. newspaper uses front page to show community connection

WARROAD, Minn.—Readers picking up the Tuesday edition of the Warroad Pioneer didnt have much to read on its front page, but the weekly publication found an unusual way to say why its community and local newspapers are important to each other.

The front page of the 115-year-old newspaper in northern Minnesota was blank with the exception of its nameplate, a banner ad and a paragraph explaining how community newspapers keep locals aware of news, using the words Without you, there is no newspaper!

The page also carried the quote, Im a reflection of the community, attributed to the late rapper Tupac Shakur.

Publisher Rebecca Colden said she and her staff wanted to show readers the Pioneer relies on the community just as the community relies on the publication for news, adding the weekly really is the peoples newspaper.

The Pioneer noted it has made significant cuts over the last five years to offset rising production expenses. The Warroad-based publication has four full-time and three part-time employees, compared with 10 workers about five years ago.

Woman rescued after passersby say she jumped from Brainerd bridge

BRAINERD, Minn.—Rescuers were able to pull a woman from the water after she jumped from a downtown bridge over the Mississippi River Wednesday afternoon in Brainerd.

A passerby reported she saw the woman climb over a fence on the south side of the Washington Street bridge and stopped to talk to her and try to convince her to come back. While the Good Samaritan was on the phone with the emergency dispatcher, the female refused to come back and subsequently jumped into the river below.

Emergency responders were on the scene quickly and went down the eastern shore of the river to retrieve the woman from the water. She was conscious but wasnt cooperating with rescuers.

An Essentia Health physician, who was driving on the bridge and witnessed the jump, also stopped to try to help with medical needs if that was necessary.

The woman was transported to the hospital.

Another witness reported seeing the woman fall backward into the water from the bridge and also stopped to try to get her out of the water but saw rescuers were able to get her out of the water quickly.

"A federal grand jury returned an indictment on Friday charging a former Draper man with a racially motivated assault against a black neighbor and his young son last year in which the defendant shouted a racial epithet and zapped the neighbor with a stun device.



Mark Olic Porter, 58, is charged with one count of “interference with housing” for allegedly interfering with the neighbor because of his race after he had moved in nearby.

Porter on Nov. 3 allegedly yelled “n-----” and said “get out of here” to the victim and his 7-year-old son, and allegedly used a “stun cane” to assault the victim, referred to as M.W., resulting in bodily injury, according to the federal charges.

If convicted on the civil rights charge, Porter faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. He was arrested on the charge in Arizona and will have an appearance in federal court there, prosecutors said.

He appeared before a federal magistrate judge in Yuma, Ariz., on Friday afternoon, and a detention hearing was set for Monday.

The alleged crime occurred near 200 E. Wasatch Point Lane (13550 South), according to charges filed against Porter in state court last year, which were dismissed in favor of the federal prosecution.

The victim, identified in the state charges as Mike Waldvogel, heard Porter allegedly shout, “get out of here, n-----” at his son, who was riding his scooter in a common area.

When Waldvogel told Porter not to yell at his son, Porter reached over a railing and hit Waldvogel’s neck with a stun cane, charges state.



Waldvogel told police he was being shocked by the cane as he got it away from Porter.



A Draper police officer who observed a red mark on Waldvogels neck reported that Porter came out of his home visibly upset, complaining that Waldvogel had stolen his cane, charges state.

Porter smelled of alcohol and refused to stay inside his residence while the officer spoke to witnesses, charges state.

After Porter tried to follow the first officer, a second officer grabbed Porters’ sleeve. Porter then spun around and “aggressively went face to face” with the second officer, who put Porter‘s arm behind his back, charges state.



Porter then struggled with both officers, knocking one officer’s body camera off. After he was handcuffed, Porter elbowed the first officer, continued to yell at both officers and threatened to defecate while on the back of the patrol car, “which he did,” charges state.

Porter was originally charged in 3rd District Court with a third-degree felony for aggravated assault and three misdemeanors for assault against a police officer, interference with an arresting officer and intoxication.

Waldvogel said Friday he has mostly kept to himself about the incident, only telling family members about what happened. He doesn’t want attention for it, he said.

“When it happened, it was like something out of a movie,” Waldvogel told The Tribune.



Despite his efforts to shelter his children from racism, the experience was “traumatizing” for his young son, and the family slept with an elliptical exercise machine propped in front of their door for the week following the assault, he said.

A couple of neighbors requested to change units in the weeks following the incident, he said. He’d never had any other issues like this with neighbors, Waldvogel said, and has since moved from the area with his children.

“I don‘t understand why people have issues with people who look differently,” he said. “We just keep to ourselves.”",1

"CRANE, OR — A two-car crash in rural Harney County Monday morning reportedly killed all eight people involved, Oregon State Police said Tuesday. Police on Wednesday released the identities of those killed. Prairie City resident Mark Robert Rundell, 48, was reportedly driving the 1999 Toyota 4-Runner that collided head-on with the 2016 Toyota 4-Runner driven by Tacoma, Washington, resident Erika Carter Boquet, 29. In the 4-Runner with Boquet were her children, Isabella Earlene, 11, Elisabeth Ann, 8, and Tytis Michael, 6, as well as her friend Kyla Marie Brown, 28, of Olympia, Washington, and Browns children Arianna Marie, 10, and Xavier King Johnson, 2. According to friends, Boquet and Brown were heading to Las Vegas for an end-of-summer trip.

The Protecting Affiliated Institutions Act, which has bipartisan sponsors, was introduced in both the Senate and the House on Tuesday. The Muslim-Jewish Advisory Council, which works to curb hate crimes within religious communities and to promote “the contributions of religious minorities in the United States,” has lobbied on behalf of the legislation.

The legislation would enhance the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996, which made attacks against houses of worship a federal crime. The new bill expands this resolution to include other religiously affiliated institutions, such as schools and community centers. It would also broaden the the purview to include threats, and would make damaging protected property a felony, rather than a misdemeanor.

“Burning down a mosque or vandalizing a Jewish cemetery is intolerable. Now is the time to take action against hate crimes in our country,” Council Co-Chair Stanley Bergman said.

In a letter sent to members of Congress, the Council emphasized the severity of hate crimes toward both Muslim and Jewish groups. “There was a 67 percent increase in hate crimes against Muslim Americans in 2015, according to FBI data, while Jews remain the targets of the most hate crimes based on religion,” the letter stated.",1
"Earlier this week, before a press conference about the arrests of gang members, the U.S. Attorney for Ohio’s southern district, Ben Glassman, did something unexpected: He spoke out against the violence in Charlottesville, Va.

“One civilian was killed and two police officers died in the line of duty,” Glassman said.

Then he pointed to the history of Department of Justice and why it was created in 1870.

“Was to investigate and prosecute terrorism by the Klu Klux Klan,” he said. “That was under the leadership of President Ulysses Grant, a native of the southern district of Ohio.

Charlottesvilles protests against the removal of Confederate monuments, initiated by a rally of white supremacist groups, led to the death of three and the injuries of dozens of others. Ohio is closely connected, with a Toledo-area man charged with murder after allegedly driving a car into a crowd of counter-protesters.

According to Paul Becker, a professor of sociology at the University of Dayton, the Ku Klux Klan has a long history in Ohio.

He says he started researching the KKK and other hate groups in Ohio back in the ‘90s: “You know, reading their newsletters, trying to understand things from their perspective.”

For his research, he attended a number of hate group rallies.

“In the 1990s there was a Klan group that had a goal one year to hold a rally in every county in the state,” Becker says.

At these and other demonstrations, Becker says that contrary to common stereotypes of the ignorant racist, many of these participants were well-spoken and educated. And they knew how to attract media attention to help spread their message.

“They know that if they hold a rally, theyre going to have the counter protesters,” Becker says. “Theres always going to be the chance for violence, and thats what theyre hoping for.”

According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, 35 known hate groups are located in Ohio. There are churches that promote anti-Semitism and anti-LGBT ideology, Black separatists, anti-Muslim groups, and of course white supremacists.

But its hard to track their activity and to know for sure how big these groups are and if there are others. Becker says the available data rely on reports from the media and law enforcement.

So there could be activity in rural areas that dont get the media attention, so they may be missed, he says.

For years, the KKK has gone out at night to distribute recruitment fliers in counties throughout Ohio, but Becker says its not clear how many people are involved.

So again that could be 5 or 10 individuals that are identifying themselves as a Klan group and are trying to get their message out, or it could be one person, it could be 100, he says. It could be 200.

According the state Department of Public Safety, the rate of hate crimes in Ohio is twice the national average and has been climbing steadily since 2012. Becker says that doesnt necessarily point to hate groups.

The research that was being done on who was committing hate crimes, most of those werent committed by organizations, Becker says.

The Internet has become instrumental in helping hate groups organize. The world’s most visited neo-Nazi website, The Daily Stormer, was started by a man from Worthington, and for years the site received mail at a Worthington address.

When it comes to the events in Charlottesville, Becker says its important to understand that the impetus for this big alt-right and white supremacist gathering was the removal of the statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee. Thats because these groups dont tend to agree on much, or work together.

Extremist movements have always been splintered, so I think anything that could bring them together could potentially be dangerous, Becker says.

As cities like Baltimore, Md., and Lexington, Ky., call for the hastened removal of their confederate statues, Becker says its likely well see more public demonstrations by these groups.

Ohio has some 300 monuments dedicated to the Civil War, most of which are small placards, and several of which represent the Confederacy, The largest are two cemeteries for Confederate soldiers, including Camp Chase here in Columbus.

Camp Chase, unlike monuments in other cities, originally served during the Civil War as a Union Army training center and prison camp where thousands of Southern soldiers and loyalists died. Some 2,260 people are buried at the cemetery.

Officials say there have been no efforts to remove any relics there.

Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the number of Confederate monuments in Ohio.",1

"Federal prosecutors have filed a hate crime charge against 51-year-old Kansas resident Adam Purinton, according to the Department of Justice. Purinton, who is accused of shooting three people in an Olathe bar, reportedly told a local Garmin engineer to “get out of my country” before opening fire. Purinton is currently being held on first-degree murder charges filed by local prosecutors.

Garmin engineer Srinivas Kuchibhotla was killed in the attack, remembered by family and co-workers as a gentle man eager to help friends. “He did not deserve a death like this,” Kuchibhotla’s wife said in the days of the attack. Kuchibhotla’s friend and fellow Garmin employee Alok Madasani was injured, as well as a third man who attempted to intervene. Early reports indicate that Purinton believed Kuchibhotla and Madasani were of Middle-Eastern descent, and yelled racial slurs in advance of the attack.

Today’s indictment accuses Purinton of committing murder “because of Kuchibhotla’s actual and perceived race, color, religion and national origin,” with additional charges for the attempted murder of Madasani and violations of federal firearm statutes. The Justice Department declined to say whether it will pursue the death penalty, although it is authorized by the hate crime statute.",1

"In today’s world, not even the immense money and fame can protect you from being victimized by racism. A few days ago, the Los Angeles home of Cavaliers superstar and the best player in the world, LeBron James, was broken into and vandalized with racist remarks. James spoke about the unspeakable act a few hours after in the NBA Finals media availability session, and didn’t hold back.

However, the struggle did not end there as Fox Sports 1’s Jason Whitlock went a step too far, making the absurd statement saying that James isn’t really a victim of racism because he is rich.

With that remark made on a broadcast of “The Herd with Colin Cowherd,” Whitlock angered a lot of people in the sports community. This was to be expected, since his comments were out of place and, as it can be seen from what happened to LeBron James, untrue.

First to LeBron’s defense came Green Bay Packers tight end Martellus Bennett, who tweeted out about how fabricated those statements are, adding the amount of money is irrelevant to this debate since it does nothing to protect you from racism in general.

To say that its not someones fight because theyre rich is just ridiculous. Racism doesnt care how much money you make. — Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) June 1, 2017

A for any black american thinking that the world will view them differently because they have a little money, yall tripping. — Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) June 1, 2017

Another athlete who came out in support of LeBron James was his teammate, Dahntay Jones. Jones decided to take the calmer approach and gave his reasoning why he believes Whitlock was wrong in his claims.

“Money does not make you immune to insensitivities or ignorance,” said Jones, in an interview with USA TODAY Sports. “It still has an impact on your family, and it’s still uncomfortable. People asked (James) about it. He gave his opinion, and he said that he made a (comparison) to Emmett Till. He just said what came to his mind. He didn’t say it was the same thing as Emmett Till. “He (said), ‘We have to make sure we bring these issues to the forefront, and we have to speak on them. And we have to not brush them under the rug. …(Whitlock) tried to push it, and make it seem like it doesn’t exist for him because he has money. No, it exists. [Chris] Broussard was speaking truth. …I guess for (Whitlock’s) ratings, he just wanted to shut it down because Broussard never had a chance (to talk). He took the (stance) of ‘This is my show, I can interrupt you.’.. It was disrespectful, I thought.”

However, it was not only athletes who came out in support of James. Mike Hill, who covers the L.A. Clippers at times during the season for Fox Sports, where Whitlock works, also spoke out on Twitter. His point was that the only reason why Whitlock was doing this was for attention and, like Jones said, possible for ratings.

When youre saying stuff jst for the shock value or think its going to bring attention 2u, youre jst a media whore. Selling it 4 attention — @ItsMikeHill (@ItsMikeHill) June 1, 2017

One thing must be clear – racism is a problem, and it is still ongoing in the United States. Now, is it an issue of richer or poorer African-Americans, that does not even matter in the grand scheme of things. The only thing that matters is for us all to accept that it is still an issue, and to try more and more each day to come to a solution to the problem.",1
"Reported hate crimes increased across the country and in Vermont last year, according to data released Monday by the FBI.

The data from the FBI says there were 25 hate crimes reported in Vermont last year — up from eight in 2015. Its also the highest number in the last seven years.

The FBI defines a hate crime as quote a traditional offense like murder, arson or vandalism with an added element of bias.

The data released this week shows that last year the number of hate crimes rose to 6,121 from 5,850 in 2015 — a 4.6 percent increase.

Most of the victims in the 2016 data, 58.9 percent, were targeted because of their race or ethnicity.

"Early Sunday morning, a gay man’s jaw was broken after a fight broke out in Brooklyn, New York. Police are investigating the attack as a possible hate crime.

The 27-year-old victim was trying to break up a fight. That’s when the attacker called the victim an anti-homosexual slur and punched him in the face, cops said.

This incident is a reminder that despite New York City being an enclave for the LGBT community, hate crimes still happen based on a person’s sexual orientation and gender identity.

As NewNowNext points out, hate crimes against gay men are the most common type of hate crimes against a person in New York City. A study released in August, 2016 gives us the troubling statistics:

The most frequently reported bias motivations for hate crimes against individuals were anti male homosexual (26.2%), anti-Jewish (24%) and anti-black (15.6%).

Gay men (72), Jewish (66), and black (43) individuals were targeted in 181 of the 275 bias crimes against people

Within the anti-sexual orientation category, male homosexual bias accounted for the majority of incidents (72 of 89).

These stats are from 2015. The NYPD has yet to release information regarding 2016.

Other reports recently released have shown that this year, there have already been more hate motivated homicides against LGBT people than all of 2016.

That report comes from the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs. The data they present shows that in 2016 there were 28 hate-violence-related homicides of LGBT people. Already this year, there have been 33 anti-LGBT hate violence murders across the country. The date from 2016 does not include the Pulse nightclub terror attack hate crime murders of 49 people.

The attacker from Sunday morning’s incident in Brooklyn is still on the loose. Police released photos and video of the attacker, who’s described as black, about 5-foot-10 and 200 pounds. He wore a white tank-top and dark pants.

"An 18-year-old has been charged with first-degree arson, accused of setting a fire last month at the now-closed Islamic Center of Eastside. It’s the second fire there in a year; police do not believe it was a hate crime.

An 18-year-old Bellevue man has been charged with first-degree arson for allegedly setting a fire in what was once the primary prayer room of the Islamic Center of Eastside, according to Bellevue police.

Carlos Diaz Cruz is accused of setting a large pile of toilet paper on fire with a cigarette lighter, setting a March 21 blaze at the Bellevue mosque that’s been closed since it was badly damaged by an arson fire in January 2017.

Cruz was released from the King County Jail in February after serving nearly five months on a second-degree-assault charge for slashing another teen’s shoulder with a knife, jail and court records show. He was arrested March 27 in connection with the mosque fire and remains jailed in lieu of $250,000 bail.

Built in 1978, the 2,400-square foot, wood-frame building sits on a half-acre of land at 14700 Main Street, according to King County property records. Mosque elders intend to tear down the damaged structure and rebuild but had not yet started work at the site when the second fire was set.

Isaac Wayne Wilson, a homeless man with an extensive history of mental illness and property damage, was found setting the first fire in the mosque parking lot on Jan. 14, 2017, and later pleaded guilty to first-degree reckless burning.

No one was hurt in either blaze and there was no indication the fires were hate crimes or bias-related.

Since its closure last year, the former mosque has been boarded up and surrounded by a 6-foot fence that’s posted with no-trespassing signs, according to criminal charges filed against Cruz.

But in the weeks before last month’s fire, someone made a hole in the fence on the property’s northeast corner and the former mosque became a teenage hangout littered with pizza boxes, drink containers, clothing and bedding, say the charges.

Bellevue police were able to identify Cruz and four other teens, aged 15 to 19, from video-surveillance footage that was then shown to school resource officers and officials from the Bellevue School District, according to the charges. The other boys who were with Cruz — and stomped out flames the first two times Cruz attempted to light the toilet paper on fire — also provided statements to police, the charges say.

On the afternoon of the fire, the five teenagers went to the mosque, where they talked and ate pizza, say the charges. Cruz began breaking windows, then grabbed several large rolls of toilet paper that he unrolled, creating a pile several feet high in the middle of the floor, according to charging papers.

When Cruz used a lighter to set the paper on fire, one of the boys stomped out the flames, but Cruz quickly relit the pile and the same boy again stomped it out, the papers say.

He told Cruz to stop and Cruz, who became angry when his attempts were thwarted, reportedly said, “I’m going to burn this (expletive) down,” the charges say.

The third time Cruz lit the toilet paper, the fire ignited and though the other boys tried to stomp it out, it spread quickly and became too big for them to extinguish and they fled, say the charges.

One of the teens later told police Cruz “lit the fire because he was ‘being stupid’ and it had nothing to do with hatred,” say charging papers.",1

"Chancler Encalade, 20, was sentenced yesterday to 10 years in prison for assaulting a man because of the victim’s sexual orientation, announced the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Eastern District of Texas, and U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ Dallas Division.

According to the plea agreement, Encalade admitted he, Nigel Garrett, and another co-defendant, used Grindr, a social media dating platform for gay men, to arrange to meet the victim at the victim’s home. Upon entering the victim’s home, the defendants restrained the victim with tape, physically assaulted the victim, and made derogatory statements to the victim for being gay. The defendants brandished a firearm during the home invasion, and they stole the victim’s property, including his motor vehicle.

A federal grand jury previously returned an eighteen-count superseding indictment that included charges for hate crimes, kidnappings, carjackings, and the use of firearms to commit violent crimes. The indictment also charged the defendants with conspiring to cause bodily injury because of the victims’ sexual orientation during four home invasions in Plano, Frisco, and Aubrey, Texas, from Jan. 17 to Feb. 7, 2017. Garrett, their other co-defendant, and Encalade subsequently pleaded guilty to hate crime charges from this indictment. Garrett was recently sentenced to 15 years in prison.

“The defendant targeted his victim with violence because of his sexual orientation, and used the internet to facilitate this crime,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore of the Civil Rights Division. “The Civil Rights Division will continue to vigorously prosecute hate crimes such as this one.”

“The defendant not only broke in, but he did it specifically to intimidate individuals because of their sexual orientation,” said U.S. Attorney Joseph D. Brown for the Eastern District of Texas. “This is the kind of case where federal and local law enforcement should come together, and that happened effectively here.”

The investigation is being conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, the Plano Police Department, and the Frisco Police Department.

"A Florida man pleaded guilty to threatening to bomb a local mosque in a “hate-filled and profanity-laden voicemail message,” federal prosecutors said.

Dustin Allen Hughes, a 26-year-old from Cutler Bay, faces up to 20 years in prison for the federal hate crime. He pleaded guilty Thursday to one count of obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs through the threatened use of a dangerous weapon and explosive.

Broward Sheriffs Office Dustin Allen Hughes is pictured in a mugshot taken on May 15.

Prosecutors in Miami said Hughes made the threatening phone call to Jamaat Ul Muttaqeen Mosque in Pembroke Pines on May 5, days before the start of Ramadan. He reportedly left a profanity-filled voicemail message in which he denigrated Muslims and said, “I planted a bomb in your temple.”

“Where you guys have your sanctuary and worship Allah, I’m gonna blow that mother fucker up,” Hughes said in the voicemail, according to prosecutors. “You guys are all going to be up in flames after I’m done with you.”

Law enforcement swept the mosque for explosives but found none.

Hughes was arrested on May 15. The man indicated to investigators that he had left the message to scare and upset mosque members.

U.S. Attorney Benjamin Greenberg said Friday that his office is committed to protecting Florida residents’ right to freely practice their religion.

“Obstructing this right, by force or threat of force, constitutes a hate crime that we will continue to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law,” Greenberg said in a statement.

Hughes’ sentencing is scheduled for Sept. 6.",1
"Deep Rai, a 39-year-old Sikh man who was allegedly shot in the arm by a man who told him to go back to his country, is recovering from his wound at home in suburban Seattle.

The victim is shaken up and concerned about the safety of his family, but he felt really, really blessed that he has survived with very little suffering and that hes received an enormous amount of support, said Jasmit Singh, another community leader.

Police in the city of Kent are investigating the Friday night shooting as a hate crime and the FBI has joined the investigation. No arrests have been made so far, police said. Seattle FBI spokeswoman Ayn S Dietrich said the agency, in conjunction with the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division, has also opened an investigation into the case to determine if there was a federal civil rights violation.

The FBIs Seattle office said it is committed to investigating crimes that are potentially hate-motivated.

The shooting comes after an Indian man was killed and another wounded in a recent shooting at a Kansas bar that federal agencies are investigating as a hate crime after witnesses say the suspect yelled get out of my country.

"Attacks on mosques in the UK have more than doubled in the past year and religious hate crimes rose nearly 30 percent in the country.

A series of deadly terror attacks this year led to concerns over retaliation against the United Kingdoms large Muslim population.

Those fears played out in June when a Cardiff man drove a van into Muslim worshippers in Finsbury Park, in north London , killing one person and injuring at least 10 others.

A bigger police presence and more security cameras are among the measures taken to make these streets and its places of worship safer.

But concerns about security remain.

Weve seen after every attack happened elsewhere not just only in the UK, we receive some letters, threatening letters, telephone calls and even sometimes they try to burn down the mosque for example, putting pig heads sending white powder and so on. This is happening unfortunately in Finsbury Park mosque and other mosques, said Mohammed Kozbar.

"Lacey Township police issued 651 handgun permits in 2015, up 89 permits from 2014, Police Chief David A. Paprota said. But the number of permits issued in 2015 is still down 216 permits from the all-time high of 867 in 2013, the chief said. Historically, the Lacey Township Police Department processed and issued an average of 200 handgun permits annually upon application from local residents in the years leading up to and through 2008. The annual statistics for the issuance of handgun permits in Lacey Township is as follows: Year Handgun Permits Issued 2015 651 2014 562 2013 867 2012 506 2011 398 2010 289 2009 354 2008 187 2007 217 2006 227 2005 191  When a resident applies for a handgun permit, the Lacey detective and records bureaus do a comprehensive background check. Paprota reviews each applicants background report, then signs off on the permit. The lengthy process is often delayed by required processes outside the control of the police department, including the receipt of responses by references provided by the applicant, Paprota said.

UNIVERSITY CITY, MO (KPLR) – After nearly 200 headstones at Chesed Shel Emeth Society were knocked over or destroyed, many see this act of vandalism as a clear sign of anti-Semitism. However, police said at this point in the investigation, there is no evidence to suggest this was a hate crime.

Detectives spent Monday and Tuesday going door-to-door interviewing neighbors and collecting surveillance footage from surrounding businesses.

Thus far, police have not uncovered any clear leads.

The cemetery dates back to the late 1800s.

Police said they’re working with people and organizations in the community, including the Anti-Defamation League, which has announced a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the people behind this cemetery desecration.",1

BY ERIKA NORTONThe Orange County community was shocked and saddened last October when it was discovered that the Temple Beth Shalom cemetery in Warwick had been vandalized with anti-Semitic graffiti.Since then, there has been a wave of other anti-Semitic incidents and threats against Jewish community centers and schools across the country.Since the start of the year, at least 100 Jewish community centers and day schools in 33 states have been the target of bomb threats, forcing leaders and administrators to evacuate their facilities — many full of children — and disrupt their daily lives.So far, all of these threats have turned out to be hoaxes.Meanwhile in Missouri and Pennsylvania, large Jewish cemeteries have been the subject of vandalism, with hundreds of headstones toppled and loved ones left to clean up the mess.The rise in anti-Semitism has reached such a point that President Donald Trump addressed the issue within the first minute of his speech to Congress on Tuesday night.“Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last weeks shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies,” Trump said, “we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms.”There have been no major anti-Semitic incidents in Orange County since the Temple Beth Shalom cemetery desecration.But Suzanne Leon, president of The Jewish Federation of Greater Orange County, Suzanne Leon, said organization is deeply concerned about the rise of anti-Semitism and hate crimes across the country, which further affirm the work of the federation.“Fighting anti-Semitism in all its forms and ensuring the security of the Orange County Jewish community is part of the Federation’s core mission and remains a top priority,” Leon said. “The Federation is actively working with local law enforcement, elected officials, and communal professionals to ensure the safety of the Orange Jewish community.”Leon also said that while there haven’t been any incidents to the scale of the cemetery vandalism, there have been a number of anti-Semitic incidents over the last several months in local schools and school districts that to her knowledge, have not been reported to local authorities.At the middle school in Sparta, N.J., there were two incidents of Nazi-related graffiti last November, with the first incident going unreported to the local police for a week, until parents brought up the issue at a board meeting.To address anti-Semitism in schools, the federation has offered to be a resource for Holocaust education and tolerance curriculums for use in local schools, according to Leon, and anyone interested in learning more is encouraged to contact their office in Newburgh.In response to the New York state bomb threats, Gov. Andrew Cuomo held a conference at the Sidney Albert Albany Jewish Community Centers on Wednesday where he condemned the recent anti-Semitic acts and discussed the state’s recently announced initiatives to combat hate crimes across the state.These initiatives include a $25 million grant program for safety and security upgrades at schools and day-care centers at risk of hate crimes or attacks because of their ideology, beliefs or mission, and a $5,000 reward for any information leading to an arrest and conviction for a hate crime. Cuomo also launched a new hate crimes text line, where New Yorkers can simply text the word “HATE” to 81336 to report incidents of bias and discrimination.Before announcing these initiatives, Cuomo held a roundtable discussion on Feb. 23 with more than 50 different Jewish community and interfaith leaders, which included Village of Kiryas Joel Administrator Gedalye Szegedin, who said he was invited to attend on behalf of Kiryas Joel and the Jewish communities of Orange County.Szegedin said that the rise of anti-Semitic acts throughout the state was point of discussion and is a concern for Kiryas Joel.“New York must always be the beacon of tolerance and hope for all, and with the recent explosion of anti-Semitism and hate crimes, it is more important than ever before that we do everything in our power to ensure the safety and equal treatment of all New Yorkers,” Cuomo said while announcing the new initiatives. “Any acts of bias or discrimination will be met with the full force of the law. New York is and always has been a place that celebrates diversity and religious tolerance, and we say to all New Yorkers who feel unsafe — we will always protect you.”New York lawmakers have also condemned the rise in anti-Semitic hate crimes, including and Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-18) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D).“I am incredibly disturbed by the many bomb threats against Jewish Community Centers, schools, and acts of vandalism against Jewish cemeteries in recent weeks,” Sen. Gillibrand said in a statement. “These threats should be a wakeup call to anyone doubting whether anti-Semitic criminals are feeling emboldened in the current political climate. We must continue to speak out against hatred and bigotry in all of its forms, and make it clear that these violent and threatening acts will never be tolerated in our communities.”Sen. Chuck Schumer announced Wednesday that he thinks Jewish Community Centers under threat should have the ability to trace and identify threatening callers, citing recent “swatting” incidents at the Middletown school district.As far as the Temple Beth Shalom cemetery vandalism in Warwick, Warwick police said that there is no new information but that the Warwick and state police are continuing to investigate the incident. An award of $10,000 is available for information leading to a conviction in the case.",1
"White supremacist groups are making an unprecedented effort to recruit students on college campuses, according to a new report by the Anti-Defamation League, a civil rights group which tracks anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry.

The ADL reports there were 107 incidents of groups they identify as white supremacist fliering on college campuses since the school year started in September 2016, and more than half of those incidents have taken place since January 2017. Other recruiting efforts include holding rallies, hanging anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant or anti-Semitic posters, visiting campuses to talk with students and giving public speeches, according to the ADLs Center on Extremism.

This recruiting comes in the midst of an increase in the number of hate groups and hate crimes, which have been reported by groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center, the FBI and the NYPD. The ADL points to the 2016 election and the current political climate as the reason for the emboldened efforts of white supremacists.

White supremacists have consciously made the decision to focus their recruitment efforts on students and have in some cases openly boasted of efforts to establish a physical presence on campus, Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADLs CEO, said in a press release. While there have been recruitment efforts in the past, never have we seen anti-Semites and white supremacists so focused on outreach to students on campus.

"Two men died and another was injured Friday on a light-rail train when they tried to intervene as a man yelled hate speech or biased language toward two young women, one of whom was wearing a hijab, police said.

Portland Police Jeremy Joseph Christian.

Two men were stabbed to death Friday on a light-rail train in Portland, Oregon, after they tried to intervene as a man yelled hate speech at two women who appeared to be Muslim, police said. A third passenger who tried to intervene was also stabbed but is expected to survive. The male suspect, who ran off the train, was arrested a short time later on foot near Providence Hospital, police said in a statement. He was later named by police as Jeremy Joseph Christian, 35, of North Portland. Christian was booked into Multnomah County Jail on two counts of aggravated murder, two counts of second-degree intimidation, and being a felon in possession of a restricted weapon. Police noted Saturday that aggravated murder is a capital offense in the state of Oregon. He is being held without bail and will be arraigned Tuesday in Multnomah County Court. He may face additional charges after the Multnomah County District Attorneys Office presents the case to a grand jury, police said. The FBI and the US Attorney for Oregon are assisting in the investigation.

Christian was a known white supremacist who had previously shown up to extreme-right marches and performed Nazi salutes. He frequently posted on Facebook, often expressing violently Islamophobic, anti-Semitic, and white supremacist views. Detectives will extensively examine the background of the suspect, Jeremy Christian, including the information publicly available about the suspects extremist ideology, police said in a statement. A review of the suspects record with the Portland Police Bureau shows he is not flagged as a criminal gang member, nor does he have any known mental health history listed.

Police identified Ricky John Best, 53, and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, 23, as the victims who were killed in the attack. Micah David-Cole Fletcher, 21, was identified as the third passenger who was stabbed but survived. He is currently being treated at a hospital for serious injuries that are not believed to be life-threatening. Prior to the police announcement, an Oregon woman wrote on Facebook that her son was one of the deceased. Taliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche, mother Asha Deliverance wrote of her son. My dear baby boy passed on yesterday while protecting two young Muslim girls from a racist man on the train in Portland. He was a hero and will remain a hero on the other side of the veil.

According to his social media accounts, Namkai-Meche was a graduate of Reed College in Portland, where he studied economics, and worked as a research intern at the Cadmus Group, a consultancy company.

Shortly before 5 p.m., the suspect was ranting about a number of things on the MAX train near the Hollywood transit station before using what would be characterized as hate speech or biased language and focusing on two young girls, one of whom was wearing hijab, Portland police Sgt. Pete Simpson told reporters at a briefing posted by The Oregonian. Thats when the three men tried to intervene and were attacked viciously by the suspect, Simpson said. Best died at the scene, and Namkai-Meche succumbed to his injuries at the hospital. It’s horrific, Simpson added. There’s no other word to describe what happened today. The girls who were verbally attacked left the scene of the stabbing before police arrived but were later identified and contacted by detectives. Police are not releasing their names at this time. Detectives are continuing to investigate the attack, including the information publicly available about the suspects extremist ideology. He has no known history of mental health issues or criminal gang affiliation, police added. Imtiaz Khan, President of the Islamic Center of Portland, told OPB theres been an uptick in hate speech and harassment of Muslims since the presidential election. There are roughly 50,000 Muslims currently living in Portland, including sizable refugee communities from Bosnia, Iraq, and Somalia. We are very sad. Ramadan started just a couple hours ago, said Khan. We are very sorry for the two men who tried to do the right thing. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler was on a flight to London at the time of the stabbing, but took the first flight back to his city. In a statement on Facebook, he called the two deceased victims heroes: Two men lost their lives and another was injured for doing the right thing, standing up for people they didnt know against hatred. Their actions were brave and selfless, and should serve as an example and inspiration to us all. They are heroes.



There is too much hatred in our world right now, and far too much violence. Too much of it has arrived here in Portland.



My heart goes out to the families of those who lost their lives, and to those who witnessed what happened. Thank you to our first responders, who provided aid, and police who captured the suspected killer.



Now is the time, we must come together as a community and love one another. We must reject hatred and violence. We must seek justice. Wheeler reiterated those sentiments at a press conference Saturday afternoon, speaking alongside Oregon Governor Kate Brown and law enforcement officials, as well as local Muslim leaders. Calling the attack a horrific act of racist violence, Wheeler vowed to relentlessly pursue justice for the victims of Fridays incident. Our current political climate allows far to much room for those who spread bigotry, Wheeler said. Violent words can lead to violent acts. Brown similarly offered her condolences to the families of the victims and to members of Oregons Muslim community, calling Fridays attack a crime of hate. Safety while traveling through our community is a basic human right that we need to be able to guarantee to everyone, regardless of where theyre from, or what they believe, she said. Portland Transit Police Commander Sara Westbrook said that officials would be increasing the number of patrol officers on the citys light rail in the wake of the incident. Federal law enforcement officials said it is too early to determine whether federal hate crime charges will be filed. Once we have reviewed all the evidence, and I mean all the evidence, we will review whether federal hate crime charges are applicable, US Attorney Billy Williams said. Still, he promised theres a day of reckoning coming to hold the suspect responsible.

At least one other person appears to have followed Christian from the train station until police arrived. In a video posted on Facebook Friday, police are seen confronting Christian near a bus stop. The man who took the video, Larry Blackwood, can be heard saying that commuters of the train followed the man from the station after he was seen stabbing three men. He stabbed three people in the fucking jugular, Blackwood says in the video. Thats why we chased his ass down. Police officers can be seen with their guns drawn while the suspect yells profanities at them. Shoot me, then, the man is heard shouting. Shoot me then. Portland Police Sgt. Peter Simpson confirmed to BuzzFeed News that the video showed Christians arrest. Blackwood did not immediately respond to request for comment from BuzzFeed News. In an interview with KATU-TV, another bystander, Alvin Hall, said that he also chased down the suspect, after stepping off the train and seeing the victims lying bleeding. Eventually, he said, he met Blackwood and a third witness, who had also given chase, and the trio confronted Christian. The minute he saw me he started coming after me. Hes like, You want some of me, youre a snitch, come on after me, you want some of this? and started chasing me, Hall said.

The Democratic Party was sure they were about to elect the first female president. The Republican nominee was a businessman who had yet to run for any lesser office.

Nearly every major pre-election poll came to the same outcome: Hillary Clinton would be the next president of the United States. When Nov. 8 arrived, it became clear these polls were wrong.

Ashley Moraguez, UNC Asheville assistant professor of political science, said the polling procedures for elections are flawed.

“The Democrats thought they had a comfortable lead because of polling results and that may have affected their strategy,” Moraguez said. “In the end, however, it looks like the polls systematically missed important segments of the population. They focused on likely voters and did not count on inactive voters being motivated to vote in this election.”

The inactive voters Moraguez talks about are those who do not typically vote in elections, but were moved by Trump’s campaign to make their voices heard.

“I think his major campaign strategy was to run against Washington, to run as an outsider,” Moraguez said. “He had no prior political experience and could credibly say he wasn’t part of the swamp in Washington. Even though he ran for the Republican nomination, he was still able to run as an outsider within the party.”

According to Pew Research Center, the inactive voters Trump most heavily influenced were white males without college educations.

While many of these voters may not have the same troubling views Trump infamously declares himself to have, an increase in problematic behaviors and hate speech seems to be spreading across the nation and Lt. Joe Silberman of the Asheville Police Department has a theory as to why.

“We have a role model in a president that’s comfortable supporting people that say some stuff, and even he himself saying some stuff, that it’s making people who have these opinions more comfortable coming out with them,” Silberman said.

Silberman refers to those who cling onto Trump’s “grab them by the pussy” comments and who march in Charlottesville, Virginia, with tiki torches in an effort to preserve Confederate monuments.

“Trump, as an individual, did not organize or lead the protests or violence in Charlottesville but that does not mean that he is not culpable for what happened there,” Moraguez said. “I think Trump’s campaign rhetoric, the policies he has supported and even some of the individuals he has chosen to put into this administration have sent signals to certain segments of that population that radicalism, discriminatory viewpoints and even hate speech is acceptable.”

Moraguez said it does not matter if Trump has never gone on record saying he shares these ideas, as he makes it clear he is OK with this rhetoric by not speaking out on it. When he does speak against it, Moraguez said it is often too late to make a difference.

With a political climate that seems to breed hate, it appears natural for it to seep into every corner of the nation. However, Silberman doubts this trend will continue in Asheville.

“The climate of Asheville doesn’t really support a hate group being able to flourish here. I think the closest we’ve got is there’s been some religious rhetoric that went on a couple years back,” Silberman said. “It wasn’t really like a Charlottesville thing and even back then we were prepared for there to be a battle and for us to be in the middle.”

Silberman said in Asheville there are generally more counter-protesters than protesters. Moraguez calls these citizen protests a sign of a healthy democracy.

“In the current period, I am not convinced we are seeing signs of a healthy democracy,” Moraguez said. “The political climate is very polarized and there is very little cooperation or civil discourse between the two parties. I think that Trump, whether directly or indirectly, has normalized certain behaviors and viewpoints that are problematic and discriminatory and have no place in our political discourse in 2017.”

Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer said while she was more worried initially about whether or not local projects would continue to have federal funding, she has since become more concerned about hate speech.

“Me, individually, and the council as a whole have had to make statements and adopt resolutions making it clear that we’re not supportive of hate speech, that we condemn it,” Manheimer said. “That continues to flare up periodically and we didn’t have to do that before Trump was elected.”

Still, Silberman is not convinced Trump’s rhetoric and policy have made their way to Asheville.

According to a document provided by Silberman, Asheville Police reported five hate crimes in 2017, an increase from the two in 2016. Silberman cautioned jumping to conclusions on these numbers as in 2015, seven hate crimes were reported.

Despite these statistics, the notions of hate crimes and what qualifies is a complicated issue, especially in North Carolina.

“We have to report to the state. It has to do with a federal mandate. I think the state wants it every year at least. The feds really want us to report it every three months. We report it every month,” Silberman explained. “That being said, we have never charged a hate crime because it’s not a crime in North Carolina. Hate crime is a federal law.”

The Asheville Police Department cannot charge anyone with a hate crime without first consulting the federal government. Silberman said the most they can charge anyone with is ethnic intimidation.

According to North Carolina state law, ethnic intimidation is defined as, “If a person shall, because of race, color, religion, nationality, or country of origin, assault another person, or damage or deface the property of another person, or threaten to do any such act, he shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.”

Silberman said the Asheville Police Department reports these crimes to the federal government when local officers recognize something as being a significant problem. He said they will present the best case they can, but sometimes the FBI will still not take the case.

“It’s not a simple process and the burden of truth is extraordinary,” Silberman said. “They won’t take cases unless they know on the front end that they can win.”

Ethnic intimidation is the closest thing Asheville police can come to identifying a hate crime. Even with these strict barriers, Silberman said the department casts a broad net to identify as many problems as possible. In the past seven years, this net has only caught a total of 45 hate crimes. Despite not seeing an increase in hate crimes, Silberman is still cautious against riots.

“I think Charlottesville could happen in Asheville and that’s reasonable thinking. To say that it could happen anywhere is true,” Silberman said. “We have two Confederate monuments that different people feel very strongly against and when I say different people, I’m not saying there’s two sides to this. You could split them, but different people feel differently about it for different reasons and things could easily spin out of control.”

Silberman maintained should any riot happen in Asheville, the police department would be ready to deal with it. He said for every rally they find out about, they create an operations plan outlining what to do in cases ranging from heat exhaustion to a full-on riot. For Silberman, the goal is to keep everyone safe.

Moraguez said Trump does not seem to share this goal and often incites more harmful action to follow.

“I think that Trump did himself a disservice in how he responded to the violence in Charlottesville and that he is deserving of the criticism and backlash that he has gotten as a result of it,” Moraguez said. “In not condemning white nationalism, racism and discrimination unequivocally, he is further deepening the wounds in our democracy and polarizing our political environment. The president should serve as a unifier in times of crisis, not as a divider.”

Manheimer said she and the city council continue to focus on equity and have even gone so far as to hire an equity manager. She said that while she does not know whether the increase in hate speech is because people are more comfortable with their opinions or because more people are now thinking this way, she is committed to making sure Asheville remains a safe place for everyone.

“That is likely the most problematic feature of the Trump presidency,” Moraguez said. “Normalizing hate and discrimination.”",1

"A gay couple was attacked and stabbed in an apparent hate crime on Saturday night in Denver, Colorado.

Christopher Giovanni Huizar, 19, and Gabriel Enrique Roman, 23, were walking to their downtown home after spending the evening at the Church Nightclub when a man screamed “fucking faggots” at the men.

Huizar says he felt a “punch” only to discover he’d been stabbed in the neck. Roman jumped in to protect his boyfriend and was stabbed in his hand.

The couple began to run from the attacker, but Roman was stabbed again, this time in the back.

After escaping the attacker, the two men collapsed against the side of a building crying and bleeding.

“I was just worried about my boyfriend because he bled so much,” said Huizar.

Eventually a pair of passersby found the couple and called for emergency services.

At the hospital, Roman’s injuries required 30 internal stitches and 52 stitches on his hand.

The men told the local NBC affiliate that the attack will only strengthen their relationship. “We are not letting his define us. We love each other and wouldn’t want this to happen to anyone else,” said Huizar.

According to Denver Police, a man has been arrested for the crime and is being held on charges of aggravated assault. Police say the attack is being investigated as a hate crime.

The couple, who will celebrate their first year together on Wednesday, have set up a GoFundMe campaign to help pay for their extensive medical bills and lost wages work.

"PORT ANGELES — A report last summer of a black man beaten while being called a racial slur, which was investigated as a hate crime, has resulted in misdemeanor charges of fourth-degree assault against one man and obstructing a law officer and making a false statement to police against a second man.

Clallam County Prosecuting Attorney Mark Nichols signed the District Court 1 criminal complaints Wednesday against Corey L. Stone, 19, and David Robert Love, 20, both Port Angeles-area residents.

The first court appearances for Stone, charged with assault, and Love, charged with obstruction and making a false statement, are at 9 a.m. May 23.

Port Angeles police and the FBI had investigated the reported assault of Quinn Smith, then 22, as a possible felony hate crime under state and federal statutes, Nichols said Friday and Police Chief Brian Smith said Saturday.

Chief Smith said the case also was reviewed by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Seattle.

Nichols, who also reviewed the case for a possible hate-crime charge, said injuries inflicted in fourth-degree assaults are the least physically injurious under state laws for assault.

“Assault 4 is more like a schoolyard fight,” Nichols said.

Quinn Smith was treated for contusions, abrasions and a facial welt and released from Olympic Medical Center shortly after the attack reported at about 2:30 a.m. July 17 between the Eighth Street bridges.

Quinn described an unprovoked assault in which he was called the N-word and beaten.

He said his attacker was among about a half-dozen high-school-age people, both males and females, who approached him after they drove up and got out of three vehicles at West Ninth and Cedar streets while he was walking from a bar to a friend’s house.

Chief Smith said Saturday “there was some level of acquaintance, some level in this encounter” between Quinn Smith and his alleged attacker.

“The male kept calling him racial slurs and said that he [Quinn Smith] was going to die,” Police Officer Harold Balderson’s said in a case report he wrote later on the same day of the attack.

Quinn Smith told police that while he was being pummelled, he feared for his life, so he did not fight back.

When the man stopped hitting him, and as another man approached him, Quinn Smith pulled out his cellphone to call 9-1-1, and the group fled, he told the PDN in a Nov. 30 interview.

“Growing up my whole life, I’ve been used to being called racial slurs,” he said in the interview.

“But I’ve never been attacked over my skin color.

“That was a game changer to me.”

Quinn Smith, who was a Port Angeles resident at the time of the assault, could not be reached Saturday for comment.

An FBI spokeswoman did not return an email for comment Saturday afternoon.

A state felony charge of malicious harassment — “Washington’s version of a hate crime,” Nichols said — was considered .

But Nichols said it did not fit the crime.

A person is guilty of malicious harassment for causing physical injury to a person because of religion, sexual orientation or other factors including the victim’s race or if one threatens a person for any of those reasons to the point that it makes them fearful of being harmed.

“One of the charges considered by law enforcement was malicious harassment,” Nichols said.

“The investigation took them in a different direction based on the facts presented.”

“We have charged the crime based on the facts we can prove.”

Nichols said the Port Angeles Police Department referred the case to his office with the assault and false-statement recommendations, and that he added the obstruction charge based on what he read in police reports.

Chief Smith told the PDN on Sept. 2 that the assault, combined with racial slurs, “absolutely” makes the offense a hate crime and a civil rights violation.

“We believe victims in crimes,” he said in the interview.

“In the beginning, we only knew what we knew from one party,” he said Saturday.

“One of the reasons this took so long was this thing was thoroughly investigated.

“A lot more was discovered about what happened.”

Nichols and Chief Smith said they could not provide specifics about what led to the charges against Stone and Love.

A PDN public records request for the investigative report was denied before the criminal complaints were filed last week.

"Hate can happen anywhere—on BART, a school campus or while just casually walking down the street, says Assemblyman Evan Low.

The former Campbell mayor said during a community meeting on Nov. 27 that he’s heard plenty of stories from people who have been attacked because of their identity, whether it be because of ethnicity, religion, sexuality, political affiliation or a combination.

That’s why Low teamed with the Council on American-Islamic Relations to participate in bystander intervention training.

“Frankly, being born and raised in Silicon Valley, I never thought (attacks) would happen,” Low said, regarding his own experiences and after seeing a viral video of an Asian American man being verbally and physically attacked on BART in November.

According to the FBI, 6,121 criminal incidents and 7,321 related offenses were reported last year as being motivated by bias against race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, disability, gender and gender identity. Earlier this summer, the state’s attorney general reported the number of hate crimes in California rose about 11 percent last year.

“When we see wrongdoings, we should fight,” Low said during the meeting. “We should stand up to people.”

The training teaches people to help the victim rather than focus their attention on the attacker, according to Courtney Mangus, programs coordinator of the Council of American-Islamic Relations San Francisco Bay Area Office.

According to Mangus, this is the first year the office is conducting the bystander training, which has spread by word of mouth to other organizations. The Council of American-Islamic Relations hosts trainings for organizations that request them.

“The training is meant to cut the bystander effect,” when a person is less inclined to assist someone because there are others around, Mangus said. “This returns responsibility to the public.”

Mangus said bystanders who witness a person being targeted should not address the attacker at all. Instead, point out to other bystanders that something wrong is happening and help the targeted person by talking to them or help them leave the area.

“Make sure you or someone records and documents the incident,” Mangus said. “Never interact with the attacker; it could escalate the situation. Go up to the targeted person and have a conversation with them, any conversation. The attacker is ignored, and people are not validating what’s being said.”

She added that bystanders and victims look should also look for an exit from the immediate area.

"By near-unanimous vote, California legislators this week approved a bill that would add a new crime to the state’s longer-than-usual list of charges that can result in the loss of gun rights: misdemeanor hate crimes. Should Governor Jerry Brown sign the bill, the state would become the sixth in the country to implement such a law.

California has a long history of organized hate. Its prison system birthed the Aryan Brotherhood, one of the oldest and largest white supremacist groups in the country. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups in the United States, has identified 79 in California — more than in any other state.

Like most states, California saw an increase in the number of hate crimes reported in 2016. The rise was concentrated in the state’s large cities, especially Los Angeles. Civil rights groups have blamed the surge on Donald Trump’s racially divisive presidential campaign, though police suggest that another likely explanation could be that more people are reporting incidents. Reports increased 11 percent year-to-year.

There have been several high-profile examples in which firearms were used in hate crimes to kill. In 2012, a known neo-Nazi opened fire at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, killing six. In June 2015, a committed white supremacist armed with a Glock pistol murdered nine members of a historic African-American congregation in Charleston, South Carolina. This past February, a man in Olathe, Kansas, shot two South Asian patrons of a bar, killing one and wounding a third person who tried to intervene.

However, guns are most often used by perpetrators of hate crimes to terrorize their victims. An analysis by The Trace of hate crimes involving firearms between 2011 and 2013 found that firearms were used in most incidents as a means of intimidation.

Efforts to get guns out of the hands of people convicted of hate crimes picked up after the mass shooting in Charleston. In February 2016, U.S. Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, a Democrat, introduced a bill to bar individuals convicted of misdemeanor hate crimes from gun ownership, though it never received a hearing. (The bill sitting on the California governor’s desk mirrors Cicilline’s proposal.) In April of this year, New York State Senator Daniel Squadron put forth his own bill aimed at prohibiting people with low-level hate-crime convictions from getting guns.

If the California bill becomes law, police could have a difficult time enforcing it. Hate-crime reporting is notoriously spotty, and a relatively small share of hate-crime charges result in a guilty verdict. Of the 931 hate crimes logged California in 2016, just 307 were referred for prosecution. The state provided the disposition of just 118 cases of those cases — of which only 51 resulted in a conviction (some defendants charged with hate crimes were convicted of other offenses).

“It’s notoriously difficult” to prosecute hate crimes, former U.S. Attorney Benjamin Wagner told PBS Newshour in January. That’s because the state has to prove defendants’ intent, not just that they committed a particular act.",1

"Community members at a vigil for the two men slain on a Portland commuter train. Photo by Diane Keefauver for PW.

PORTLAND, Ore. — Around 1,000 people attended a vigil last week near the MAX transit station where the stabbing took place. People sat in the grass, facing each other in a circle as one by one family, friends and others affected by the tragedy rose to speak. Asha Deliverance, the mother of Taliesin Namkai-Meche, appears in photographs like a hippie goddess embracing friends and strangers. Taliesin’s last words were “tell everyone on the train I love them.” Love was very much the theme. Flowers and candles dotted the landscape. The walls of one of Portland’s iconic bridges were covered with chalk graffiti. Messages like “We stand together” and “Love wins over hate.”

Namkai-Meche’s sister, Vajra Alaya-Maitreya, released a statement:

“Taliesin Myrddin lived a joyous and full life. His enthusiasm was infectious. We lost him in a senseless act that brought close to home the insidious rift of prejudice and intolerance that is too familiar, too common… He was resolute in his conduct and respect of all people. In his final act of bravery, he held true to what he believed is the way forward. He will live in our hearts forever as the just, brave, loving, hilarious and beautiful soul he was. We ask that in honor of his memory, we use this tragedy as an opportunity for reflection and change. We choose love. Safe journey, Taliesin. We love you.”

MET, the Muslim Center in Tigard, hosted a vigil later that evening, following the first night of Ramadan’s fasting. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler attended, saying the packed auditorium gave him hope.

News of the attack was trending on twitter and facebook with hashtags like #portlandheroes, #portland, #stabbing and #hatecrime. Within days of the tragic stabbing, three crowdfunding campaigns for the victims topped $1 million. Another to raise money for necessities and mental health services for the two girls (the attacker’s original target) had nearly reached $20,000.

Everyone seemed to be talking about it.

“Champions of justice risked and lost their lives. Hate is evil,” said Senator Jeff Merkley.

Oregon’s other U.S. Senator, Ron Wyden, tweeted: “The horrific killing shocks the senses and must sound an alarm louder than ever about the violence that follows hate speech.”

Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said: “They were attacked because they did the right thing. Their actions were brave and selfless and should serve as an example and inspiration to us all. They are heroes.”

Some were conspicuously silent. Although one of the victims was a Republican, politician, veteran and father; there was (as of then) no word from the Republican Party or the White House. President Trump, never far from Twitter, must have known many Americans believe his anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant rhetoric have contributed to a rise in hate crimes such as this.

But in case he didn’t know, on Sunday, Dan Rather posted a message to Facebook reminding him.

The next day, Asha Deliverance, wrote an open letter to President Trump.

“I’m writing to you today, Memorial Day, to share my heart after losing my son… Our family grieves, but we are proud that through his selfless action he, along with the other two men, has changed the world, when in the face of hate he did not hesitate to act with love… These brave men saw the immediate injustice and didn’t hesitate to act. They recognized the truth: we are more alike than we are different. To ride the train home without being assaulted because of the color of your skin or your religious beliefs, is an inalienable right.

You have said that you will be President for all Americans. So, I ask you Mr. President to take action… Please encourage all Americans to protect and watch out for one another. Please condemn any acts of violence, which result directly from hate speech & hate groups. I am praying you will use your leadership to do so.”

Eventually Trump responded on twitter with three sentences.",1

"Investigators found a Nazi swastika and a racial slur spray painted on the residence of Laquan and Jennifer Madison, who are black, when they responded to the fire in the small community of Schodack, in southern Rensselaer County, New York.

Laquan Madison recalled seeing an “orange glow” when he got up to use the bathroom shortly before midnight Sunday, according to media reports.

“I screamed my wifes name … and we all got out,” he told reporters Monday when he briefly returned to view the charred rubble, the Albany Times Union reported in today’s editions.

“Its not going to force me to move,” Laquan Madison added.

The garage, which did not have electricity, was destroyed by the fire, which spread to the adjoining residence causing exterior damage, according to investigators who have classified the arson fire as a hate crime. A damage estimate wasn’t available.

Madison, 31, expressed thankfulness that he, his wife and their five children, all under 9, including a newborn, were able to safely escape the fire. The family’s goats and chickens also were saved.

The homeowner told the Albany newspaper that while he’s not forgiving the arsonist, “people are going to be who they are. My hope is they understand life is not a joke. You cant toy with people.”

Jennifer Madison said she experienced a similar hate crime several years ago when she lived in Nassau County, New York.

“This is our home. This is where we live,” Jennifer Madison said. “Were OK. This is just something I accept. This is the world that were living in.”

Schodack Police Chief Joseph Belardo said the family was emotionally traumatized by the incident which he called a hate crime that occurred “out of the blue.”

The family has lived in the house for three years and has “good relationships with their neighbors,” the chief told the Albany newspaper.

“Whoever did this will be facing some very serious charges,” the police chief said. There have been no arrests.

Hate crimes are “not something that happen very often out here,” said Beldaro, who couldn’t recall such a case in the community in the past 20 years.",1

"Three New Hampshire juveniles could face hate crime charges after an an alleged assault on the Boston musician known as Keytar Bear.

Keytar Bear is a well-known street musician who dresses in a bear costume and plays music in various places across Boston.



Boston police responded to a call Saturday at 4:40 p.m. in the area of Congress and State streets downtown for an assault and battery in progress.

A responding officer saw the well-known Keytar Bear surrounded by a group of young men in what appeared to be a fight.

Photo credit: @BostonTweet

When the officer approached with the lights and sirens activated on his cruiser, the young men fled on foot.

Witnesses were able to point the officer in the direction of the suspects, observing the young men climbing up the scaffolding of a building and laying down on a platform in an attempt to hide.

When the officer ordered the suspects to come down, they complied.

Following an investigation, police learned that Keytar Bear had been attacked by the suspects while he was playing music near Faneuil Hall.

The suspects allegedly ripped off Keytar Bear’s mask before striking him several times in the face and body while using racial slurs.

Police said when witnesses attempted to intervene, the suspects also hurled racial slurs at them before fleeing.

Jessica Baldwin, of Nashville, Tennessee, was in town for Sail Boston with her 10-year-old son, Thompson Fine, when they witnessed the attack.

Right after I took the picture of the guy with his arm around Keytar Bear, he slammed his face down into the ground, took his bear head off, Baldin recalled. I didnt see the punching, but you could hear the screaming.

Police said the suspects damaged Keytar Bears equipment in the attack. The man sustained a facial laceration and swelling to the right eye.

He later said he felt it was a hate crime. That it was racially driven, Baldwin said.

When the suspects allegedly stole Keytar Bears tips, thats when Baldwins son stepped up to the plate.

I gave him $4, Fine recalled. And I got a sticker badge.

Since news of the attack broke, there have been numerous online messages to the anonymous bear. A GoFundMe account set up to help him purchase new equipment raised $4,800 as of Monday afternoon.

I am heartbroken about what happened. We love you and what you give to Boston and we all have your back. You are a treasure, one fan wrote.



Saturdays attack was the fourth on Keytar Bear over the years.



The three juvenile suspects — a 15-year-old from Londonderry, a 16-year-old from Salem and a 17-year-old from Manchester — were arrested and charged with assault and battery and disorderly conduct. The 16-year-old was also charged with possession of alcohol by a minor.

Prosecutors said they are also reviewing the case for potential hate crime charges.

The three teens were arraigned on Monday and released into their parents custody with orders to stay away from the victim, witnesses and Faneuil Hall.",1

"LeBron James  Los Angeles home was vandalized with a racial epithet, and police are treating it as a hate crime.

According to TMZ , someone spray painted the n-word on the front gate leading up to the ball players home, and neighborhood patrol, as well as members of the LAPD responded on Wednesday morning (May 31). At this time, authorities are looking at footage from the neighbors security cameras, hoping to get a glimpse of the person responsible.

James reportedly brought the house in 2015, although its not his primary residence. He also wasnt home during the incident, since hes probably in Oakland gearing up to play the Golden State Warriors on Thursday for game 1 of the NBA finals.

"Eleven people were transported to hospitals with minor injuries after a three-vehicle collision involving a tour bus on the Golden Gate Bridge Wednesday afternoon, according to the California Highway Patrol. The crash was reported in the southbound lanes of the bridge at 12:42 p.m. A vehicle that came to a stop while approaching the toll plaza was rear-ended by a pickup truck. Shortly after that, a bus returning from Graton Casino rear-ended the other two vehicles, according to the CHP.Officers initially reported seven injuries, but have since clarified that 11 people in all were transported to hospitals with minor injuries.

"One incident of violence has resulted in two viewpoints on the proper response to it.

Despite urging from a local civil rights organization, the Columbus Division of Police will not be investigating the alleged beating of a Somali woman as a hate crime.

On Sunday, the Columbus chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-Columbus) stated in a news release that a Somali woman, who it did not name, was attacked on Saturday. The group said this occurred when she intervened to protect another Muslim woman from harassment by a white male.

The woman was beaten unconscious, resulting in facial fractures and the loss of several teeth, the organization said. According to the victim, the alleged attacker reportedly screamed “you all will be shipped back to Africa” prior to beating her.

On Monday afternoon, however, Columbus police issued a statement saying there is not sufficient evidence to make an arrest presently or to investigate the incident as a hate crime.

According to the police statement, officers were dispatched Saturday to the area of 2800 Pinellas Court on allegations of child abuse and a possible kidnapping.

One call to dispatchers said a woman was making threats and was hitting her child with a shoe. A separate call from another person said someone had kidnapped her son because they saw her hitting him. More calls were received while officers were en route. Dispatchers said they could hear threats and the sound of physical confrontation.

When they arrived at the home, the officers found a woman face down in the doorway. A man, who identified himself as her husband, told officers she had been assaulted with something like a Taser. Another woman was sitting on the steps of a nearby house, bleeding from the mouth. She told police she had been assaulted by a man.

The police report does not name any of the individuals involved. It was not possible to reconcile independently the discrepancies between the CAIR-Columbus account and the details in the police report.

The two women were transported to nearby hospitals for their injuries, which, according to police, did not rise beyond the level of misdemeanor assault.

Columbus police said officers temporarily detained the man at the scene. Multiple victims and witnesses were interviewed, but no arrests were made “due to the lack of physical evidence and conflicting stories” by all parties on scene.

The executive director of CAIR-Columbus, however, expressed dismay with the findings by the police. CAIR-Columbus said it is acting as the womans legal representative.

“The fact that the perpetrator was not taken into custody and was not charged raises serious concerns and sends a very dangerous message,” Jennifer Nimer said in a news release. “After what happened last week in Portland, police across the country should be sending a strong message that hate crimes will not be tolerated. We are asking law enforcement to investigate this as a hate crime and to bring the perpetrator to justice immediately before he commits another act of violence.”

The alleged assault has caused “rumors and speculation” on social media, the police said. One civil rights activist, Linda Sarsour, launched an online fundraiser for the woman, who is identified on the page as Rahma Warsame, a Somali American and single mother.

The Daily Caller, a right-leaning news outlet, disputed the claim, saying there is no evidence to support the possibility of a hate crime having occurred.

Although police continue to investigate the incident, they have ruled out racism or hate as a motivating factor.

“There is no evidence at this time suggesting the incident involved any type of bias which would constitute the incident being investigated as a hate crime,” police said in the release.

"Andrew Nesbitt was stabbed to death in his apartment last week.

A Wisconsin man who suffered a violent hate crime in 2011 was found stabbed to death inside his Madison apartment early last week.

46-year-old Andrew Nesbitt’s body was discovered Monday morning on his birthday. Local police have since arrested 23-year-old Darrick Anderson as a suspect in the murder, but it doesn’t appear that the two men knew each other.

Law enforcement has yet to rule out that the deadly attack was a hate crime.

Six years ago, Nesbitt endured another brutal assault outside of a former gay bar in Oshkosh.

“He was celebrating with his friends, and two men had come into the bar, and whether they knew that they were in a gay bar or not is unknown, but they left and not too long after [Nesbitt] went out to have a cigarette and they were waiting for him,” Nesbitt’s friend and LGBT advocate Kathy Flores told We Are Green Bay.

Nesbitt was rushed to the hospital following the attack, where he was treated for brain swelling and several broken bones.

In spite of the violent nature of the crime, the 46-year-old didn’t let it destroy his faith in humanity.

“I said, ’I’m sorry there’s so much hate in the world,” Flores recalled. “And he said, ’Well, I can also attest to the fact that there’s more love than there is hate and so I believe that love will win.”

He encouraged Flores to share his story to teach others how to stay safe if they were to find themselves in a similar situation to his, all in the hopes of preventing “other people from being victimized.”

According to WMTV, Anderson was taken into custody Tuesday and will likely be charged with first degree intentional homicide.",1
"CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) — A White former police chief charged with a hate crime in New Jersey for smashing a handcuffed Black man’s head into a doorjamb has pleaded not guilty.

Former Bordentown Township police chief Frank Nucera entered the plea Thursday.

Civil rights and hate crimes charges were announced last month against the 60-year-old Nucera. Authorities say he has a history of using police dogs to intimidate Black people and has been secretly recorded making racist comments by one of his officers.

He retired in January amid an FBI investigation.

U.S. Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick called the assault a “clear senseless, bigoted, hate-filled,” assault of a prisoner in custody.

Nucera’s attorney tells NJ.com the allegations against Nucera are “not pleasant” but they’re just allegations.

He says about 100 hours of secret recordings were made.

Window on the West

Opinion column

by Mary Rupert

The Rev. Wheeler Parker, in the Kansas City area recently for a church conference, was surprised when he heard on the news that an accuser of Emmett Till had changed her story.

Parker was a cousin of Emmett Till who went on the train with him from Chicago to Mississippi in 1955 to visit relatives. While at a store in Mississippi, Emmett Till allegedly whistled at a white woman. The news that the woman recanted her statement that Till grabbed her came out earlier this year.

Till, 14 years old at the time, was the victim of a lynching, brutally kidnapped and murdered. The Emmett Till death is considered to be one of the incidents that launched the civil rights movement in America. Parker was a teenager with Emmett at the time the woman originally told authorities that she had been assaulted, and some are wondering if the decades-old case now can be solved.

“Of course, it was good news for me to hear,” Parker said in an interview during his visit to Kansas City. “Now people can see Emmett Till in a different light than 60 years ago.”

For 60 years, some people thought that Emmett “got what he deserved,” but now it turns out that the woman lied, he added.

“Now America knows the truth – he did nothing to assault her,” Parker said. “So we’re glad to get that closure.”

Maybe, he added, if they can get that information from her, the authorities can get more information on the case from her. Most of those sorts of cases are never solved, and some people in the past have got away with crimes, he said. He and some others in the case support immunity for the woman in exchange for her information.

The woman in the case is now in her 80s, and the others involved in the Till case are senior citizens, as well.

A minister in the Pentecostal Church of God, Parker said people are called to forgive. However, he added that “we can’t afford to forget.”

Besides sparking the civil rights movement, the Till case greatly affected all the individuals involved. Till’s mother went back to school, got her master’s degree and dedicated her life to doing good because of what happened to her son, he said.

“It changed me, I became a minister,” Parker said. He dedicated his life to doing good, “because you can never forget.”

Parker called for more outreach on civil rights issues on the part of the clergy. “We’ve got to have some outreach among pastors about what’s happening to our people,” Parker said.

With the Till Bill 2 – the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Reauthorization Act of 2016 – that Kansas City, Kansas, human rights activist Alvin Sykes has been working on, a mechanism has been set up to investigate cold civil rights hate crimes. Parker credited Sykes’ work in getting the bill passed last year.

Parker said this seeking after justice is Sykes’ calling in life. “This is his area of expertise,” Parker said. “He has a fire in his belly.

“I tip my hat to him,” Parker said. “He doesn’t give up.”

Said Sykes, “The poison of Emmett’s death didn’t overcome him (Parker); he used it for a very positive life.”

The changing landscape



The landscape is changing in different ways for Sykes and his efforts to solve old civil rights hate crimes in America.

Sykes, a human rights activist in Kansas City, Kansas, who is president of the Emmett Till Justice Campaign, plans to meet with U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican, on Tuesday, March 28, in Washington, D.C., to discuss implementation of the Till Bill 2 at the Justice Department.

His work was not completed when the Till Bill passed Congress – it also needs to be implemented by the administration, which now has changed.

Sykes said he is asking the Justice Department to prioritize the Till Bill 2, and he wants to work with the attorney general’s office in developing a strategy for its implementation. Before, he said, there wasn’t much coordination between those working in the field and a strategy of how to implement it.

The main goal of the March 28 meeting is to open the lines of communication, he said. Some real issues may be discussed after the chief assistant attorney general for civil rights is appointed, he added.

Sykes is not just working on legislation in Washington, D.C., however. He also was working recently with State Sen. David Haley, D-4th Dist., on Senate Bill 128 in the Kansas Senate. This bill could double the penalties for hate crimes. The bill has been introduced in previous years and had its third hearing this year.

With a possible hate-crime link to a recent shooting in Olathe, Kansas, there was renewed interest in this bill, according to Sykes. He said since most of the acts of bias-motivated crimes are not murders, but are lesser crimes such as vandalism or assault, a lot of times they are not prosecuted. By increasing the penalties for these crimes, it makes the clear statement they won’t be tolerated, he said. He’s working on other bills, as well.

For Sykes, much of his effort is all about finding the truth, and getting closure, after so many years.

“He has no ulterior motive,” Parker said. “He just wants to see.”

"Police are investigating an alleged hate crime after a noose was found on the sidewalk outside an East Bay school. Scott Budman reports. (Published Wednesday, Sept. 6, 2017)

A noose was found outside an East Bay school, prompting a hate crime investigation, police said.

An Alameda High School resource officer was informed of the discovery around 3:30 p.m. Tuesday. A rope was tied into a small noose and tied to a fence near tennis courts on Encinal Avenue, school district officials posted on Facebook.

We are horrified, said Susan Davis with the Alameda Unified School District.

Police said in a statement that they believe the suspect could have left the rope on display with the intention of threatening another person in the enjoyment of a right secured to him/her by the United States Constitution.

Thats why the crime is being investigated as a hate crime.

However, neither police nor administrators know how the noose got there.

we dont know if it was a student or if it was a community member, Davis said. There is no evidence at this time that its a student.

The noose has since been removed, said school district officials, who have notified all the high school students parents.

A noose is a powerful symbol of intimidation. Please know that we denounce this kind of symbolic violence in the community, the district wrote on Facebook, urging potential witnesses to come forward.

Alameda has experienced a rash of racial intolerance in the past month: Two broken windows at Temple Israel and flyers featuring a Swastika.

I dont know why somebody would do that, other than, like, a dumb joke or to spread hate, said Alameda High School student Siosiua Mesui.



Others were equally disappointed.

I feel like its some kid trying to get a rise out of us, especially since we are a left-(leaning) community, said student Chelsea Dillacorta.

The school district and police department say theyre trying to get to the bottom of the most recent crime, while keeping students focused on school.

We unequivocally denounce any kind of bigotry, hatred or intolerance, Davis stressed.",1

"Debate on a hate crimes bill was emotional and, at times, heated Tuesday as a Senate committee kicked off conversation on the issue.

Indiana is one of five states without a hate, or bias crimes, law. The legislation would allow judges to impose harsher sentences if a crime was committed in part because of a victim’s characteristics – such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or gender identity.

More than a dozen people and organizations spoke in favor of the bill, including the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce, the Indianapolis Jewish Community Relations Council, a Bloomington transgender woman, and the Indiana Prosecuting Attorneys Council.

La’Kyesha Gardner, an African-American woman from Fort Wayne, spoke against the bill – but because she says it doesn’t go far enough. Gardner’s 15-year-old son Jason was beaten by a white man last year. The attacker, who used racial slurs, was recently sentenced to 30 days behind bars.

“But we look to you to help us feel safe,” Gardner told lawmakers. “Because as of right now, I am a Hoosier – but I wish that I wasn’t.”

Opposition to the measure it primarily driven by religious conservative groups. Attorney Jim Bopp says creating a list of those who should be protected lessens protections for everyone else.

“Now I understand that there are liberal elites and corporate bigwigs that now think that we ought to have a special list of people that we protect,” Bopp says.

And Indiana Family Institute President Curt Smith says the bill is searching for a problem.

“What if Hoosiers really are tolerant and welcoming?” Smith says.

Muslim Alliance of Indiana’s Aliya Amin citied several recent cases of hate-motivated crimes against Hoosiers. And she says the bill is about more than just those incidents.

“It is about telling our Hoosier neighbor, ‘You are safe,’” she says. “It is about allowing our children to grow up in an Indiana where they can be proud of who they are instead of hiding their identity out of fear.”

Fishers Mayor Scott Fadness says beyond the moral case, there’s an economic argument for the bill.

“This bill is critical to demonstrate to the state, the country, and the globe that we are a culture of inclusivity,” Fadness says.

Similar bills have failed to pass in several recent sessions.

The committee will consider amendments and potentially vote on the this year’s legislation next week.",1

A state Department of Justice investigation has been launched into the Chico police killing of Desmond Phillips, a mentally ill young black man gunned down in his living room last March, Phillips’ father claimed at a news conference Monday.

Neither state Attorney General Xavier Becerra’s press office nor Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey responded immediately to requests from ChicoSol for comment on David Phillips’ claim.

Ramsey previously ruled that the shooting by Chico police officers Alex Fliehr and Jeremy Gagnebin, who together fired 16 rounds at Desmond Phillips, was justified. A wrongful death claim – often a precursor of a lawsuit – was filed by the Phillips family but denied by the city.

David Phillips and his attorney, John L. Burris of Oakland, met Nov. 9 with Becerra at the AG’s San Francisco office.

“Mr. Becerra affirmed that there is now an investigation under way that will be happening independent of the influence of Butte County law enforcement or District Attorney Ramsey,” said David Phillips, reading from a prepared statement. “Mr. Becerra stated that he will be overseeing this case personally.”

Besides Fliehr and Gagnebin, David Phillips named at the news conference three other Chico police officers he believes fired their guns at his son, but provided no evidence to support that claim and then declined later to answer questions, saying he was following his attorney’s advice in not doing so.

Erica Traverso with the Justice for Desmond Phillips campaign provided to the news media a list of 28 people she says were killed by Butte County law officers in the last 20 years, including three shootings in 2017.

“Seventeen of the 28 victims had a history of mental illness known to law enforcement and 12 of them were killed by police responding to a mental health crisis or welfare-check call,” Traverso said.

David Phillips wore an “Even More Names” T-shirt that was a replica of one worn by former professional football quarterback Colin Kaepernick for a photo for GQ that illustrated the naming of Kaepernick as that magazine’s citizen of the year. Before his release by the San Francisco 49ers, Kaepernick sparked debate by kneeling during the pregame playing of the national anthem as a protest against social injustices.

The shirt lists the names of numerous African-Americans who have been killed by law officers or who died in police custody, including Freddie Gray, who died in 2015 after being transported by Baltimore police. Gray is listed just above Desmond Phillips’ name on the T-shirt.

Among others speaking at the news conference, held at the Bethel AME Church in Chico, was Scott Rushing of Ventura, whose son Tyler died in a shooting involving Chico police on July 23. Rushing noted that Monday was his and wife Paula’s 41st wedding anniversary.

“Unfortunately, our celebration is choked and suffocated” by the killing of their only son, Rushing said. “We support the use of trained crisis intervention personnel to deal with barricaded people like Desmond and Tyler so there is a possibility that no one gets hurt and no families have to suffer the loss of a loved one.”

"Kansas lawmakers will consider a proposal to enact a hate crime law two weeks after the murder of an Indian engineer in Olathe drew international attention.

Sen. David Haley, a Democrat from Kansas City, Kan., said that he introduced the bill before the tragedy in Olathe, but that the murder of Srinivas Kuchibhotla, a 32-year-old engineer from India, has given the issue a greater focus.

“This is the second time in three years where Kansas is in the national or world spotlight for a hate crime,” Haley said, noting the 2014 shootings at the Jewish Community Center and nearby Village Shalom care center in Overland Park that left three people dead.

In the latest incident, Adam W. Purinton, 51, has been charged with fatally shooting Kuchibhotla and wounding Alok Madasani, a 32-year-old Indian national, reportedly because he thought they were Middle Eastern. Another man, Ian Grillot, 24, was also wounded when he came to their defense.

SIGN UP

The FBI is investigating the attack as a hate crime.

Kansas has no hate crime law, so Purinton will face no additional hate crime charge on top of the first-degree murder and attempted murder charges at the state level.

Senate Bill 128 would change that. Haley said that a person convicted of a hate crime would face a presumptive doubling of his sentence under the bill.

Kansas law does enable judges, when sentencing, to consider it an aggravating factor if a crime was “motivated entirely or in part by the race, color, religion, ethnicity, national origin or sexual orientation of the victim.”

The Senate Judiciary Committee will review the bill at a hearing Wednesday. Haley said that he has introduced similar legislation in the past, but it has failed to move forward.

After the Feb. 22 shooting, Gov. Sam Brownback met with Anupam Ray, consul general of India’s Houston consulate.

Haley said that he received a phone call from Ray, who “was very interested in Kansas’ law on this.”

"Winchester Man Accused of Hate Crime

16 December 2017 News

A Winchester man is accused of a hate crime after being arrested following a beating, according to officials. Harold O’Neil McDonald Jr. is alleged to have called Buddy Moneymaker a “white honky” before beating him earlier this month. The slur led to a hate crime enhancement being added to the felony assault charge, which could potentially add six months to his sentence if he is convicted.

Also charged with assaulting Moneymaker was Tiffany Marie Brower, 19, who is accused of punching Moneymaker three times in the face. McDonald was arrested on Monday, and is free on a $2,000 bond. He is due in Frederick General District Court on January 22nd. Brower was also arrested Monday and is free on bond as well.

"BEACON TRANSCRIPT – The County Tyrone police officials recently arrested a 17-year-old man who allegedly attempted to murder a gay woman by drilling a hole in her skull. When the victim was found by paramedics, she was having a seizure and had to be transported to the hospital for emergency surgery.

Gay Woman Said She Felt Her Head Being Twisted

On early Saturday, 38-year-old Brenda McLaughlin was taken to the Altnagelvin Hospital for emergency brain surgery following a brutal attack.

After she regained consciousness, the woman declared that she went to a nightclub located on Strabane street with a friend.

A couple of hours later, both left the club and were headed home when the individual knocked McLaughlin to the ground and tried to drill a hole in her skull using a cordless drill.

The woman said that when the man placed the drill against her skull and turned it on, she felt like her whole head was on fire.

Following the attack, the assailant fled, leaving McLaughlin in a pool of blood. When she was found by a passerby, McLaughlin kept losing consciousness and had violent seizures.

One of the detectives in charge of the woman’s case declared that this is definitely a hate crime, as McLaughlin admitted she’s gay.

Conclusion

So far, the investigation revealed very little. The gay woman appeared to have a small indentation in her skull, but it’s still too early to say how deep the burr hole was.

Moreover, the weapon used during the attack was discovered at the crime scene, but there’s no physical evidence that the assailant used a drill bit during McLaughlin’s assault. The guilty party, a 17-year-old man, was later taken into custody and charged with using an offensive weapon to cause bodily harm and theft.

"Three black senators—Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, and Tim Scott—introduced a bill called the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act of 2018, which proposes a law to make lynching a federal hate crime.

Booker, alongside Harris (California) and Scott (South Carolina), are the only three black senators out of the 100 in the United States. In order to pass the bill, they will need the support of 60 senators through a voice vote. So far the bill has been co-sponsored by Bernie Sanders, Angus King, and 15 more Democratic senators.

Its a travesty that despite repeated attempts to do so, Congress still hasnt put anti-lynching legislation on the books, said Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey. This bill will right historical wrongs by acknowledging our countrys stained past and codifying into law our commitment to abolishing this shameful practice.

Harris and Scott also released statements on the bill. Lynching is a dark, despicable part of our history, and we must acknowledge that, lest we repeat it, Harris said.

This piece of legislation sends a message that together, as a nation, we condemn the actions of those that try to divide us with violence and hate, Scott added.

Their proposal comes two weeks after Rep. Bobby L. Rush of Illinois and 35 members of the Congressional Black Caucus introduced a similar bill. As for the senators, they plan to amend the US Code to specify that lynching is a crime in itself that would warrant an enhanced sentence under existing federal hate crime statues.",1
"An Oak Harbor High School student was sentenced Monday for committing a hate crime against a transgender student.

The boy, 15, pleaded guilty to malicious harassment, a felony. Under the definition of the charge, a person is guilty of malicious mischief if he or she commits an assault, makes a threat or vandalizes property “because of his or her perception of the victim’s race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or mental, physical, or sensory handicap.”

The boy is not being identified because he is a minor.

According to the police report, the victim was hanging out with friends behind the school Feb. 17 when a group of boys started spewing homophobic and racist slurs. The three boys started throwing pine cones at the girl and she told them to stop.

When the girl turned to leave, the defendant punched her on the head four or five times, slapped her and pushed her to the ground.

The girl’s glasses were broken during the assault.

The victim is genetically female but outwardly presents as a male, said Deputy Prosecutor Tamara Fundrella. The student is “transitioning” and still considers herself a girl in public but identifies as a male at home.

None of the other boys in the group laid a hand on the victim. In fact, they went to help the girl and apologized for what happened.

The defendant later admitted to committing the assault, but claimed it wasn’t motivated by hate; he said he didn’t know the victim was a female.

The girl wrote in a victim impact statement that she now feels anxious at school as a result of the assault. She said she worries that the boy, or one of his friends, will confront her or start a rumor about her.

An attorney said in court that both students remain in school, but a no-contact order bars the boy from contacting the girl.

In court Monday, defense attorney Trena Berton described the defendant as a good kid who is involved in athletics at school. Berton said he just made a terrible mistake.

Fundrella argued that the crime was very serious and required a serious response from the court. She opined that the teenager won’t appreciate the cruelty of his actions or effect it had on the victim for “some time to come.”

“That is because this case isn’t just an assault on one person; it’s an assault on our values as a community,” she said. “It’s important that our judicial system has a strong and appropriate response.”

On the other hand, Fundrella explained, juveniles who are first-time offenders are eligible for a deferred sentence unless they are accused of a sex crime or under certain limited conditions.

As a result, the teenager received a 12-month deferred sentence. That means the conviction will be vacated if he complies with the conditions of supervision.

The boy was sentenced to a year of community supervision and 70 hours of community service. He was ordered to pay $70 in restitution for the glasses. A no-contact order remains in place.

Judge pro tem Clarke Harvey told the boy that there was no justification for his actions and he hoped it was an isolated incident. He also said the boy should understand he’s getting a break.

Island County Prosecutor Greg Banks said there’s no place for hate crime in the community.

“It seems to be part of a nationwide trend,” he said. “We don’t want bigotry-driven violence to get a foothold in Island County.”",1

Court hears argument in hate crime case

CHARLESTON (AP) — The state’s Supreme Court has heard arguments on whether a former Marshall University football player should be charged with a hate crime under West Virginia law.

News outlets report the court heard arguments Tuesday to determine if Steward Butler should be charged with a hate crime in connection with a 2015 attack on two men seen kissing.

Cabell County assistant prosecuting attorney Lauren Plymale argued in court that sexual-orientation discrimination should fall under the West Virginia code banning sex discrimination. She says Butler was enraged because of his own gender expectation that men shouldn’t kiss each other.

Elbert Lin, solicitor general for the state Attorney General’s Office, argued sexual orientation and sex are distinct concepts that have differing meanings.

A police officer was sent over to the Dunkin Donuts on LaGrange Road near 144th Place to investigate a report of property damage. While the officer was on his way, a dispatcher notified him that an employee was on scene and was punching walls, and was throwing items around the business, police said.

"The Justice Department has sent a federal hate crimes lawyer to Iowa to help prosecute a man charged with killing a transgender teenager last year, an unusual decision by Attorney General Jeff Sessions even as he takes other steps to erode the rights of transgender people broadly.

The case involves Jorge Sanders-Galvez, 23, who is charged with killing 16-year-old Kedarie Johnson in Burlington, Iowa, in March 2016. Authorities have not disclosed a motive, but Johnsons relatives say he may have been targeted because he identified as both male and female.

The rare decision to involve a federal prosecutor in a local murder case, first reported Sunday by The New York Times, follows pledges by Sessions to aggressively prosecute acts of violence against transgender people. Those pledges have been met with skepticism from LGBTQ advocates, who point to his actions rolling back legal protections.

This month alone, Sessions said the Justice Department no longer considers transgender people shielded from workplace discrimination under federal law, and he issued sweeping guidance on protecting religious freedom that undercuts protections for LGBTQ people. During his first month in office, he rescinded an Obama administration directive advising schools to let transgender students use the bathroom of their choice.

As a Republican senator, Sessions opposed expanding the federal hate crimes statute to protect people based on their sexual orientation and gender identity. But as attorney general, he has promised to uphold that law and has made fighting hate crimes a priority.

We are not going to allow persons in this country to be discriminated against or attacked in any way because of their sexual orientation, Sessions said at a speech in June.

Reiterating that vow, Sessions said he had directed the Justice Departments civil rights division to review some other cases in which transgender people were killed. Lawmakers in March urged him to give seven murders a closer look.

Johnson, a high school junior who was found fatally shot in an ally, was not among those cases.

Recently filed court documents show Christopher Perras of the Justice Departments civil rights division will serve as a county prosecutor in the case. He has been involved in other hate crimes prosecutions, including that of an Iowa man convicted of stomping and kicking an African-American man in a racially targeted attack. He has also prosecuted several cases against law enforcement officers accused of civil rights violations.

LGBTQ advocates said it was right to involve a federal prosecutor in the case, but it shouldnt be a publicity stunt.

For Sessions now to seek credit for helping prosecute hate crimes against transgender people is akin to him handing out gasoline and matches and then looking for a pat on the back when he prosecutes someone for committing arson, said Sharon McGowan, a former Justice Department official and strategy director for the LGBTQ-rights group Lambda Legal.

"NEWFIELD, NJ — A house explosion that killed a married couple in South Jersey was caused by natural gas, according to the Gloucester County Fire Marshals Office. However, the exact cause of the explosion has not been determined, and it will likely be several months before they reach their final conclusion, the fire marshal said on Tuesday. Foul play is not suspected in the deaths of John Paladino, 73, and his wife, 72-year-old Carole Paladino. They were the only people in the house when it exploded in the Borough of Newfield early Saturday morning, according to the Gloucester County Prosecutors Office. Although the cause has not yet been determined, neighbors told 6 ABC that the couple just had new appliances installed the day before the explosion, including a gas stove. The house was destroyed by the blast, which could be felt for blocks. Four other homes were damaged as a result of the explosion. Carole Paladino graduated from Vineland High School, and went on to work as a nurse at Millville High School, according to nj.com. She also taught religion at a catholic school. John Paladino was a part-time employee at DeMarco-Luisi Funeral Home in Vineland. Paul Vidal, 10, told the Philadelphia Inquirer he looked up to John Paladino. He was so nice, the child told the newspaper. If you got hurt, he would help you. They lived in the home for decades and raised their children there. They were set to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary, according to Fox News. Fire companies responding to the explosion and fire were Star Cross, Malaga, Forest Grove, Newfield, Franklinville, Vineland Stations 3 & 4, Willow Grove, Minatola and Collins Lake.

"More than 180 women have accused massage therapists from the popular chain Massage Envy of sexual assault, and the company has repeatedly ignored the allegations, BuzzFeed News reported Sunday night. BuzzFeed cited court records, police reports and other complaints from women who reported being groped and penetrated by massage therapists at Massage Envy locations across the country. One of the victims, Susan Ingram, called her local Massage Envy an hour after therapist James Deiter allegedly groped her during a session in West Chester, Pennsylvania, and pleaded with the staff to bar him from giving massages. The manager at the store told Ingram that Deiter was in a session with another client and could not be disturbed. Deiter would later plead guilty to sexully molesting nine women while working at Massage Envy. In another case, Danielle Dick was assaulted in a Virginia Massage Envy in October 2015. Her therapist placed his hand over mouth as he inserted his fingers into her vagina, according to the report. Dick immediately reported it to the Massage Envy desk clerk, who insisted calling the police would not be necessary because it would be handled internally. Massage experts told BuzzFeed that even if workers do not know for certain that a client was sexually assaulted, they should encourage victims to file a formal complaint with law enforcement. Experts also told the website franchises should prominently display their reporting policies and hire specially trained consultants if theyre accused of a crime. But according to the report, in places where it is not required by law, Massage Envy does not compel its franchisees to notify law enforcement, even in cases of rape. In an email to BuzzFeed, a lawyer for Massage Envy said: We hold franchise owners accountable to our policies and, when we say nothing is more important to us than treating clients with respect and giving them a safe, professional experience, we mean it.

"A married couple in Portland, Oregon, say police did nothing to help them after they were targeted by a man shouting homophobic slurs and threatening them with physical violence.

Posting video of the incident to Facebook, Trudy Dragoon said she and her wife, Wendy, had been crossing the street when the man, who appeared to be in his 20s, sped up his vehicle like he was going to hit the couple.

After the vehicle made a U-turn and parked in front of a nearby home, the couple said the man jumped out of the truck and said something about beating the shit out of f***ing d***s.

In the video, the man can be seen approaching Trudy with his fists up, shouting Come on, you look like a f***ing man. Lets go. Act like a f***ing man if you hit like one, c***, before calling her a gay pride ass b****.

I have been called so many hateful homophobic slurs, it’s nothing new to me, Trudy told Newsweek. But, she said, I have never had a man or woman come at me ready to punch me just for being a human walking down the street.

Footage of the incident shows Trudy asking if the man lives at the house he and two others have parked outside. No, he replies, adding: I stopped because youre a dumbass.

He then threatens Trudy saying, youre a f***ing woman. Id knock you on your f***ing ass after she says she has taken down the license plate number of the vehicle he arrived in.

As the mans friends start unloading bags from the vehicle, he continues to threaten Trudy, stating: Ill spit in your face… Ill leave you sleeping, b****.

Wendy can be heard asking did you just threaten us? to which the man replies Ill leave you sleeping too.

He can also be heard encouraging Wendy and Trudy to post video of the incident to Facebook, saying: Post it on Facebook, make it viral, oh my god! Lets get some f***ing views!

After the man continues to threaten violence, Trudy says: Do it, please, please lay a hand on me. Do something because Ill knock your drunk ass on your ass right now, as one of the mans friends tries to intervene, standing between the two and saying: Stop, stop.

Another friend asks Trudy and Wendy to leave, saying everythings done now. However, the altercation continues, with the video running three minutes before a Portland police officer on patrol approaches the group and asks whats happening.

Hes harassing me, Trudy says. The man counters that she wont get off my property… Tell her to keep walking, shes on my property, before the video cuts out.

Wendy filled in the blanks of what happened next in an interview with the Portland Mercury, alleging that the police officer told her and Trudy to just ignore the man.

Trudy Dragoon/Facebook

I was like, Absolutely not, Wendy recounted. I said, This is harassment. This has to be a hate crime.

However, the officer told the couple that the mans actions could not be considered a hate crime unless he had been physically violent.

He actually said, Being mean to you isnt against the law, Wendy told the local newspaper.

Trudy told Newsweek she was concerned for the couples safety.

It makes me feel uncomfortable, she said. The cop made it sound like we have to wait to be beaten up for them to do anything at all.

Being mean or a hate crime?

According to Oregons hate crime law, however, that should not technically be the case.

By law, a person can be charged with a second-degree misdemeanor if they intentionally, because of the persons perception of race, color, religion, sexual orientation, disability or national origin… subject the other person to alarm by threatening… to inflict serious physical injury upon or to commit a felony affecting the other person, or a member of the persons family.

Under that definition, the incident captured in the video alone could provide grounds for such charges.

Portland Police Bureau (PPB) spokesperson Christopher Burley told the Mercury that the department has opened an investigation into the incident.

He said the officer involved had advised the groups to avoid one another, adding that they did separate after being told to do so.

Burley said that he was not present at the time of the altercation, but insisted that a video does not necessarily convey everything that was occurring at the time of this incident.

Hours after the altercation, neighbors of the Dragoons appeared to show their support for the couple, with one person posting a photo of the vehicle the man and his friends had left parked surrounded by chalk drawings of the rainbow flag, which is used around the world to represent the LGBTQ community.

I have never had an experience with a neighbor like this before, Trudy told Newsweek. Im so thankful we have close neighbors and friends. We all take care of each other, she added.

The Dragoons said they hope to see law enforcement set an example with this incident.

People like [the man] need to be held accountable for their actions, Trudy said. If we dont set an example with this, others will do the same knowing the cops arent helpful. They know they can and will harm other LGBTQA members.

"A 23-year-old man who allegedly burglarized four houses of worship in Queens has been hit with a litany of charges, including some for hate crimes, District Attorney Richard Brown announced Wednesday.

Joseph Woznik is accused of breaking into and stealing from Blessed Virgin Mary Help of Christians church in Maspeth, St. Marys Romanian Orthodox Church in Woodside, the Bangladesh Hindu Mandir Temple in Elmhurst and St. James Episcopal Church in Elmhurst, which he allegedly hit three times. According to the District Attorneys Office, the incidents happened between March 21 and April 10.

The suspect allegedly said he was mad at God after being arrested. I don’t break into houses, only churches, Woznik, who is wanted for unrelated crimes in Florida, is accused of saying. I break in to get back at God.”

A Bangladesh Hindu Mandir Temple employee found three donation boxes were forced open, with cash gone on March 21, according to the charges. Wozniks fingerprints allegedly matched the latent ones left on the boxes.

A St. James Episcopal Church administrator allegedly discovered on the morning of March 24 that the worship houses door had been pried open and that $1,800 was missing from a lockbox stored in a file cabinet. Brown said the key for the cabinet was missing and a window on the side of the church was open.

On April 3, a priest saw that a side door of the church was unlocked and partially open. The church office was ransacked again and its door had been forced open. The charges also allege that the circuit breaker was also turned off and a Canon digital camera owned by the church was missing.

Broken glass on the floor of the church beneath a smashed side window were observed by the same priest seven days later. Three checks from the churchs checkbook were allegedly missing; the office door had been pried open again. Surveillance cameras and Wi-Fi at the church were turned off, but a male with a backpack with an emblem of the letter C, who used his shoulder and body to break open the office door, was recorded before the disconnection.

The C emblem was allegedly seen on Wozniks backpack when he was arrested on Tuesday; a pawn shop receipt for the camera and two missing checks were recovered from the backpack.

A gold-plated drawer used for communion and a corporate seal embosser were allegedly found missing from St. Marys Romanian Orthodox Church on April 10 by a board member for the house of worship. Woznik, when arrested, allegedly said that he fled the church after its alarm went off.

At Blessed Virgin Mary Help of Christians, a priest saw a window on the office door missing; the room had been ransacked. A hammer was seen next to the donation box, which allegedly had pry marks on it. Woznik was allegedly identified on surveillance footage from the evening before which showed someone using a hammer to pry open the box for donations. The defendant admitted to stealing $20 from beneath a Virgin Mary statue, it is alleged.

Woznik was set to be arraigned on two criminal complaints that charge him with fourth-degree grand larceny as a hate crime, second-degree criminal possession of a forged instrument, petit larceny as a hate crime, possession of burglars tools, third-degree burglary as a hate crime, second-degree forgery, fourth-degree criminal mischief as a hate crime and fifth-degree criminal possession of a stolen property.

Because he is wanted in Florida, Woznik is also being arranged on a fugitive from justice charge for third-degree grand theft, burglary of a structure and criminal mischief.

He could go to prison for up to 15 years if convicted.

CORRECTION:

Due to incorrect information being provided to the newspaper, and the information not being checked, a previous version of this article incorrectly stated the neighborhoods for the three houses of worship. St. James Episcopal Church is located in Elmhurst; St. Marys Romanian Orthodox Church is located in Woodside; the Bangladesh Hindu Mandir Temple is in Elmhurst and Blessed Virgin Mary Help of Christians church is located in Maspeth. We regret the error.",1
"BERLIN (Reuters) - A draft law approved by the German government allowing social network companies to be fined if they failed to remove racist posts and fake news quickly infringes on the constitutional right to freedom of expression, a parliamentary body has found.

FILE PHOTO: A general view shows the Reichstag building, the seat of the German lower house of parliament Bundestag, before the German presidential election in Berlin, February 12, 2017. REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch/File Photo

Politicians fear that a proliferation of such posts directed at the more than one million Muslim migrants who have entered Germany in the last two years might sway public opinion in the September election. Critics said the government was rushing through legislation that could damage free speech.

The proposal known as the “Facebook Law” had not clearly defined what constituted a punishable offence, the Wissenschaftlicher Dienst said in a non-binding opinion.

“The draft law doesn’t specify guidelines, examples or reference points to define criminal or punishable content,” it said. “It would have been extremely useful to provide data as well as studies to help make a proper assessment of the danger posed by the dissemination of punishable hateful content and fake news and the assumed destructive effect they have.”

Under the law, Facebook (FB.O), Twitter (TWTR.N) and Google-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) would face up to 50 million euros ($56 million) in fines for not removing posts promptly.

Martin Ott, Facebook’s chief in Germany, told Handelsblatt newspaper in an interview published on Tuesday that the draft law was problematic because it shifted the legal responsibility from the courts to companies.

“We don’t think the law meets its aim as a private company should not decide what is legal or illegal,” he said. “This is the job of courts.”

A justice ministry spokesman said the research body’s reservations would be taken into consideration and any proposed amendments would be debated by parliamentary committees.

The draft law would give social networks 24 hours to delete or block obviously criminal content and seven days to deal with less clear-cut cases, with an obligation to report back to the person who filed the complaint about how they handled the case.",1

"Two Arizona women have been arrested and charged with burglary after they went to a mosque — with three children in tow — and recorded themselves mocking the Muslim faith.

The incident, which happened earlier this month, comes at a time of heightening anti-Muslim sentiment in the United States.

Tahnee Gonzales and Elizabeth Dauenhauer went to the Islamic Community Center in Tempe, Ariz., to, as Gonzales claimed, “expose” the evils of sharia law and the “invasion and illegal takeover” by Muslims. Gonzales posted a Facebook Live video of the duo and the children walking into the outdoor playground of the mosque. They grabbed brochures and fliers about events, prayer announcements, classes and services and made disparaging comments about Muslims while Gonzales kept live-streaming.

“Oh, look at that! Food stamps, huh. Oh, look at that, double your food stamps,” Gonzales said, appearing to read a flier posted on a bulletin board. “You’re already getting free tax money. Why don’t you double it? All on the American hard-earned taxpayer.”

“Look at this, you guys,” she added, talking to her Facebook Live viewers.

Walking over to another bulletin board, the women saw an announcement about tax assistance, which prompted Gonzales to say: “What do they work and do? They don’t even work.”

At one point, Gonzales can be heard telling one of the children to not touch the outdoor slide, suggesting it’s covered in “germs.”

“This is the infiltration of the Arabic Muslim, coming in and destroying America,” Gonzales told her Facebook Live viewers. “The Muslims are nothing but evil Satan worshipers. … Pedophilia runs deep in the Muslim community.”

At one point, Dauenhauer marveled at their haul: “We have so much literature.” To which Gonzales said, “Yep, we’re gonna expose this.”

[He wanted to build Trump’s border wall. He was just charged in the bombing of a Minnesota mosque.]

Detective Lily Duran, spokeswoman for the Tempe Police Department, said the women were arrested Thursday and charged with burglary, a felony. She said “an enhancement of hate crime will be considered” for their sentencing.

Arizona does not charge people with hate crimes, but defendants could face an increased sentence if they committed a felony motivated by bias against a person’s race, gender, religion, disability or sexual orientation. Gonzales and Dauenhauer were transported and booked into the Tempe City Jail.

A message left at a number that appeared in public records under Gonzales’s name was not returned. She also did not respond to a Facebook message. The Washington Post was unable to find a contact number and Facebook page for Dauenhauer. The video is no longer on Gonzales’s Facebook page, but versions of it are still percolating online.

The alleged crime appears to have happened on March 4 without the knowledge of the mosque’s staff. Ahmad Al-Akoum, the mosque’s imam, said he didn’t know it had occurred until a few days later, after the Southern Poverty Law Center contacted the mosque about the video. The mosque alerted Tempe police, and authorities later subpoenaed Facebook to obtain the Facebook Live video, Al-Akoum said.

“It’s really disheartening and disturbing to see people this time and age as ignorant as those people are in terms of their knowledge of Islam and Muslims,” Al-Akoum said. “What’s most devastating for me was to see them tagging along those young, innocent children and giving them lessons on hate and teaching them how to be intolerant.”



Tahnee Gonzales, left, and Elizabeth Dauenhauer. (Tempe Police Department)

Referring to the video, Al-Akoum said the women bragged about what they were doing at the mosque and invited people to show up at some of the activities announced in the fliers. He said he had to make calls to warn people that protesters might show up at their events.

Al-Akoum said Gonzales’s comments were filled with misconceptions about sharia law. He noted a part of the video in which the women can be seen walking toward a nearby restaurant that sells halal meat, which Gonzales seemed to associate with sharia law.

“Halal, it means clean. It means it’s really good for you,” Al-Akoum said. “But for her, that was sharia law.”

Sharia law is a set of rules that govern aspects of the daily lives of Muslims. Soner Cagaptay, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute of Near East Policy, wrote: “In the West, sharia law is often associated with corporal punishment, such as beheadings carried out by Islamist extremists and the likes of the Islamic State. But in fact, only a few countries, such as Iran and Saudi Arabia, enact sharia in this form.”

In a 2016 column outlining myths about sharia, Asifa Quraishi-Landes, a University of Wisconsin law professor, wrote that sharia is not necessarily a law in the sense that the West sees it.

“Sharia is not a book of statutes or judicial precedent imposed by a government, and it’s not a set of regulations adjudicated in court,” she wrote. “Rather, it is a body of Koran-based guidance that points Muslims toward living an Islamic life.”

Sharia is also not about conquest or forcing Islam on non-Muslims, Quraishi-Landes said. Scholars on fiqh, or the human interpretation of sharia, “always insisted that Muslims in non-Muslim lands must obey the laws of those lands and do no harm within host countries,” she wrote.

“There’s no Muslim in their sane mind who’ll say, ‘We want to establish sharia in America,’ ” Al-Akoum said.

The incident follows a year when the number of hate groups across the country climbed. The Southern Poverty Law Center tallied 954 active hate groups nationwide in 2017, a 4 percent increase from 2016. The center said most of the growth was concentrated in neo-Nazi, anti-Muslim and black nationalist groups.

The mosque, built in 1984, is just outside of Phoenix, home to a thriving Muslim population and Muslim-owned businesses. In 2015, a group of protesters showed up outside the mosque and yelled insults at worshipers.

Pictures and videos on Gonzales’s Facebook page show that she and Dauenhauer often attended anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rallies, and brought the children with them. Several pictures show Gonzales with signs that say, “SHARIAH LAW, HONOR KILLING,” “#NODACA,” “#NOAMNESTY” and “#DACAISCACA.” Her Facebook picture shows her wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat and an American flag with President Trump’s face on it.

One video shows Gonzales and others at a Bernie Sanders rally in Phoenix on Sunday, accosting people who say they support the U.S. senator from Vermont. At one point during the live stream, a Muslim woman walked by Gonzales.

“Muslims have no right in America!” she screamed at the woman, who turned out to be Deedra Abboud, a Muslim running for U.S. Senate.

Gonzales accosted Abboud. The women talked at each other. Gonzales ranted about sharia law and how Muslims hate America, at one point pointing her finger at Abboud. Seemingly unfazed, Abboud responded by saying “I love America” over and over.

Dauenhauer was a member of the Patriot Movement AZ, a “grass-roots organization” that defends “American values against the progressive Leftist and Globalist Agenda,” according to its website. The organization said it removed Dauenhauer as a member after the incident at the mosque. Gonzales, the group said, was never affiliated with Patriot Movement AZ.

In a Facebook post Wednesday, the group said the women “conducted themselves in a manner inconsistent and offensive to the ideas and beliefs” of the organization.

Correction: A initial version of this story incorrectly reported that Gonzales was a member of Patriot Movement AZ.

"Bill and Dotty Yanett were watching Blue Bloods on television Wednesday night, when the serenity of their evening was shattered by an explosion seven doors down on 13th Street in Allentown. Windows blew out, dressers went crashing, pictures flew off the walls. It was surreal....like you were at war, said Dotty Yanett, as she sought refuge Thursday morning at in South Whitehall. Five people, including a four-month-old, were killed in the natural gas explosion. Bill Yanett, retired from his job as a bodyguard for Mack Trucks presidents, rushed to his back door to head outside. Had his roof collapsed from the weight of the snow? But the back door was jammed; he couldnt get out of his house. He ran to the front of the house and got outside. His wife, in her pajamas, stayed back. She ran upstairs, to the room where her great-granddaughter sometimes slept over. Thankfully, her great-granddaughter had not spent the night. But the room, was all trashed, she said. I just cried. Outside now, Bill Yanett could see the flames shooting from 544 13th St., just down the street. He ran to help a neighbor who lived closer to the explosion. With others, he helped smash a window to get inside. But the police and fire officials were there now and yelling for him to get out right now. These can blow at any time, he said authorities told him. Bill Yanett needed to get his wife. He rushed back to their home at 532 13th St. She grabbed her coat and shoes--finding glass inside them from the shattered windows. They left behind everything else, including their medicine and glasses. Bill Yanett got their car, and spotting two neighbors, picked them up too so they could all get out of the neighborhood. The fire marched toward their homes. This was like being in a war zone, said Dotty Yanett. You didnt know where to go. You didnt know what to do. Where could they go? Bill Yanett is an official at Christ Evangelical Church at 22nd and Tilghman streets. Since he had the key, he figured the two couples could head to the church. He called his pastor. Once at the church, Dotty Yanett rummaged through donated clothes to find pants and a shirt for her neighbor Ed to wear; he had left his house in just his nightclothes and a robe. The Yanetts and their neighbors eventually went next door to their pastors home, and they watched televised accounts of the explosion and ensuing fire. Bill Yanett left at one point to go to the American Red Cross staging area at Agricultural Hall at the Allentown fairgrounds, so that officials could know that he and his wife and his two neighbors had gotten out alright. By 6 a.m., the Yanetts were at the hotel in South Whitehall, where they will stay again tonight, courtesy of the hotel and the American Red Cross. Then, they will seek shelter with their daughter at her boyfriends home in Quakertown. I think the Lord was looking out for us, said Bill Yanett. The house can be rebuilt... Were thankful neither one of us was hurt. Bill Yanett said his 6-year-old great-granddaughter, who had a collection of dolls at the house, heard about the explosion from her mother. I would like to talk to Poppy but I dont want him upset, he said she told her mother. But she had a question, Are my dolls OK? The Yanetts, who had lived on 13th Street for 30-plus years, remember the 1994 Gross Towers explosion. They had been at a nearby diner when it happened, but they werent allowed in their home then because it was so close to the scene. They remember the nightmare of seeing people injured and evacuating there. Now their house was destroyed in the explosion and ensuing fire. This time, Dotty Yanett said, she wont be going back to 13th Street. Download the movie",0

The hearing has been rescheduled for Sept. 22. The former Newtown Middle School 8th grade science teacher was accused in April for carrying a loaded .45-caliber pistol to school.

"A far right British political group published posters warning against Muslim gang rape throughout Worcester, England, prompting condemnation from Muslims and allegations of hate crimes.

The British Renaissance Policy Institute (BRPI), self affiliated with the U.S. alt-right, claimed responsibility for the posters that U.K. police are investigating as a hate crime, according to Worcester News. The Worcester Muslim Welfare Association (WMWA) denounced the posters, which sported Arabic text that said “Protect Children … Fight Grooming Gangs.”

Jack Sen, BRPI’s founder, confirmed that BRPI was responsible and said he was proud of the Worcester members of the group for their efforts.

“I am pleased my men have taken the initiative to do something on their own,” Sen told Worcester News. “The British Renaissance Worcester branch are the ones putting up the signs in Worcester. We have 25 members in Worcester. We had a meeting in Worcester two-and-a-half months ago and encouraged them to protest peacefully and legally.”

“We gave them different ideas. We don’t want them to go into the streets … and behave like a terrorist organization and cause trouble. We have to do it in an aggressive but legal manner. Those (posters) I’m assuming are the leftovers from the British National Party (BNP),” he added.

Mohammed Iqbal, general secretary of the WMWA, said the posters were merely tools of division that served no positive purpose.

“The aim of these posters and using symbols associated with our religion is pure mischievousness and nothing more than to create division between our peace loving community of Worcester,” Iqbal said.

The posters, spread through Worcester over the last two weeks, came in the wake of the arrests of 18 members of a grooming gang in Newcastle. A three year police investigation of the gang, comprised mainly of Pakistani and Bangladeshi Muslims, revealed the members had sexually exploited over 700 women and girls.

U.K. Muslims fear that far right groups like BRPI will use the Newcastle example to fuel anti-Islamic campaigns, but some British politicians say that the prominence of Muslim perpetration of sexually exploitative crime in the U.K. cannot be ignored, according to The Independent.

“No one wants to demonize a particular community but the fact that this is happening again and again in the same circumstances and communities is a fact we cannot ignore,” Greg Stone, a city councilor in the Liberal Democrats party, told The Independent.

“I don’t think we can eliminate the scale of abuse, which has national implications, unless we ask some tough questions of the Pakistani and Bangladeshi community in particular,” he added.

Police removed the Worcester posters after a citizen filed a complaint about one of them on Aug 26.

“Officers attended and removed the poster and are currently treating the incident as a hate crime,” said Worcester Safer Neighbourhood Team Inspector Tanya Beckett.

“I would like to remind people that any activities designed to incite hate within the communities we serve will not be tolerated by West Mercia Police and will be thoroughly investigated,” Beckett added.

"The NYPD is on the lookout for white supremacists in the city as the department tries to fight back against hate crimes, which remain on the rise. NY1 Criminal Justice Reporter Dean Meminger has the details from police headquarters.

After the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia last month involving the KKK and white supremacists, the NYPD acknowledges it is keeping a watch on these groups as best it can.

While those of us at the NYPD and the U.S. government broadly track groups that commit acts of domestic terrorism — which is a crime — there is no official government list of designated domestic terrorist groups like there is for foreign terrorist organizations, said Meaghan Gruppo of the NYPD Counterterrorism Bureau.

For the first time in a public forum, the NYPD spoke about what it called white nationalist violence. There are concerns some attacks may have been inspired by Dylann Roof, the 21-year-old who shot and killed nine African-Americans inside a Charleston, South Carolina church two years ago.

Police say that mass killing may have inspired the stabbing death of 66-year-old Timothy Caughman on a Manhattan street in March. The man charged in that murder allegedly traveled to New York to kill black men.

There are similarities: They were both radicalized online, they both frequented sites that discussed black-on-white violence and advocated for white supremacy over different minority groups, and they both allegedly penned manifestos, Gruppo said.

While speaking with Jewish leaders about security for the Jewish High Holidays of Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, NYPD officials said new groups are popping up, looking to recruit millennials to become white supremacists. Rabbis at the forum said it was important to get this information.

The police will protect us, but they are trying to inform us of the types of people that lurk in shadows, said Rabbi Jacob Goldstein, a Crown Heights community leader.

It gave me a chill of what society we live in, whats going on in this day and age, that we have to be extra careful, said Rabbi Abe Friedman, an NYPD liaison.

The NYPD says so far this year, 273 hate crimes have been reported across the city — most of them anti-Semitic.

Thats a dramatic increase, and the NYPD says it is searching for ways to prevent them.

Because it is our mission to make sure nobody in New York City lives their life in fear, Police Commissioner James ONeill said at the forum.

"A terrible incident that occurred in York County in late April – an unprovoked attack on an African-American, allegedly by two white males – was a reminder that racism is alive and well.

The two men are accused of violating the Maine Civil Rights Act, which was enacted in 1992. This law prohibits the use or threat of violence or damage to property against a person based on that person’s race, color, religion, sex, ancestry, national origin, physical or mental disability or sexual orientation. A person who is found in violation of the law is convicted of a Class D crime. In Maine, a Class D crime is a misdemeanor, punishable by up to 364 days in jail and a $2,000 fine.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR Reginald Parson is a member of the Class of 2019 at the University of Maine School of Law and a resident of Portland.

When I learned that this crime is only a misdemeanor in Maine, I was shocked. If these two individuals are convicted, it’s essentially a slap on the wrist, and they can go home for violating the constitutional rights of a person solely based on the color of their skin. The punishment does not fit the crime. I propose the classification for a hate crime should increase to a Class B crime, which, under Maine law, is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $20,000 fine. When the Legislature returns in December, I plan on taking action by having a constituent bill introduced, calling for the law to be changed to a Class B crime.

Connecticut is providing Maine – and the rest of the country – an example to follow, passing a law last year that increases the punishment for a hate crime from a misdemeanor to a felony and making a first-degree hate crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison and/or a $10,000 fine.

It’s also instructive to look at other New England states’ hate-crime laws. In Vermont, criminal charges motivated by bias bring enhanced penalties: between one more year and five more years in prison with increasing fines. In Massachusetts, a person convicted of a hate crime can serve a misdemeanor penalty of up to 2½ years in prison and a $5,000 fine. However, if bodily injury results, the penalties increase to felony level: a maximum of 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.

The accusations against the two individuals in York County do not accurately represent the state of Maine. I know this for a fact. As an African-American who lives in an overwhelmingly white state, I have felt nothing but warmth and acceptance. But this is not the case for everyone who is not white, or speaks a different language, or loves another person of the same gender.

In 2016, Maine had a rate of 3 reported hate crimes per 100,000 people, according to FBI statistics, while the national average was 2.1. What’s more, according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis, Maine is one of just eight states where hate incident rates spiked in the 10 days after President Trump’s election, compared to the average annual rate between 2010 and 2015. These data highlight a problem that needs to be mitigated and a need for stronger penalties for those who commit despicable actions based on prejudice and hatred.

My motivation to change this law is not because the victim was an African-American and the alleged suspects were white. I believe that no other person should target, harass and/or assault another person because of something that makes them different. No one has the right to do that to anyone.

I have been an advocate for equality in my own way by seeking to use the law and change policies. As an undergraduate, I drafted and proposed a student bill of rights; in graduate school, I became an ally for the LGTBQ+ community by becoming a SAFE trainer. Participants in Students, Staff and Faculty for Equality training provide education and awareness on various topics that affect the LGTBQ+ community. I also witnessed growing up what racism and bigotry can do to someone, years after it happened, i.e., my father, who was born in the 1940s and came of age during the 1960s and lived with the scars of what happened to him until he died in 2015.

Maine is a welcoming state, but it also needs to show that when racism, bigotry and hatred attempt to rear their ugly heads, they will not be tolerated, and that those who interfere with a person’s civil rights will be held accountable and severely punished.

"NEW YORK, NY — The NYPDs civilian oversight board may start investigating complaints of sexual misconduct by cops, making it the first such body in the nation to do so. The Civilian Complaint Review Board will vote at a Wednesday meeting on a resolution that would empower it to investigate and administratively prosecute accusations of sexual harassment, rape and other misdeeds that the NYPDs Internal Affairs Bureau currently handles. If the boards 10 sitting members approve the resolution, it would immediately start investigating complaints of non-criminal sexual misconduct by cops, such as catcalling, taking photos during strip searches or other lewd behavior, according to a CCRB memo. The boards staff would also develop a plan to probe more serious allegations such as sexual assault and rape, which would require specially trained investigators, the memo says. In the meantime, the CCRB would continue referring those complaints to the Internal Affairs Bureau and to local district attorneys offices for possible criminal prosecution. The move would expand the CCRBs purview and take administrative investigations of sexual misconduct by cops outside the Police Department. Every act of professional misconduct tends to chip away at the publics trust in its law enforcement officers and, more broadly, in the institution of policing, the CCRB memo says. Perhaps no abuse of authority, however, undermines societys confidence in the police more than an officer who wields the badge as a tool of sexual intimidation and coercion. In addition to rape and sexual assault, the memo says, the board would investigate any complaints of cops having sex on duty, even if it was purportedly consensual. NYPD policy prohibits sex on duty, but the City Council and state Legislature are trying to explicitly outlaw it, citing unbalanced power dynamics between cops and civilians. The CCRB says it would be the first civilian police oversight body in the U.S. to have jurisdiction over sexual complaints. The board can recommend disciplinary charges against officers and prosecute them at administrative trials overseen by the NYPD. The CCRB got 117 complaints of sexual misconduct by cops from January 2016 to June 2017, ranging from catcalls to unwanted touching and rape, the memo says. The board referred all those complaints to the Internal Affairs Bureau, which handles internal NYPD investigations of wrongdoing by cops. The CCRB now wants to fold sexual misconduct into its current jurisdiction, which includes allegations of force, abuse of authority, discourtesy and use of offensive language. (S)exual misconduct by a police officer is, at its core, an abuse of authority, the CCRB memo says. Patch has reached out to the NYPD for comment. Well update this story if we hear back. Wednesdays vote will come as two former NYPD cops, Richard Hall and Eddie Martins, face criminal charges for allegedly raping a teen they had handcuffed in Brooklyn in September. Both have reportedly claimed the sex was consensual. It also comes as lawmakers across the nation try to clamp down on sexual harassment and assault as part of the global #MeToo movement. Michael David, an attorney for the woman Hall and Martins are accused of raping, said he welcomes the idea of another agency tackling sexual misconduct by cops. But his experience with the CCRB leads him to believe it isnt aggressive enough in sanctioning officers for wrongdoing, he said. Any other agency that would investigate police misconduct is obviously going be helpful, but personally I dont have confidence in them, David said.

"James Alex Fields Jr. stands on the sidewalk ahead of a rally in Charlottesville, Va., on Aug. 12, 2017. Later that day he is accused on ramming his car into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing Heather Heyer. On Wednesday he was charged with federal hat

A 21-year-old Ohio man accused of killing a woman last summer by deliberately ramming his car into people protesting a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., now faces federal hate crime charges.

The Justice Department announced Wednesday that a federal grand jury in Charlottesville charged James Alex Fields Jr. with one count of a hate crime act resulting in the death of Heather Heyer.

Heyer was demonstrating at the Aug. 12 counterprotest when authorities say Fields deliberately sped his gray Dodge Challenger into the crowd, killing the 32-year-old and injuring many others. Graphic video of the incident was shared on social media.

Fields was also charged Wednesday with 28 counts of hate crime acts causing injury and involving an attempt to kill.

In all of the cases, prosecutors say Fields willfully injured the victims because of their actual or perceived race, color, religion and national origin.

The federal charges were filed in addition to charges Fields was already facing in Virginia. He was arrested and charged with second-degree murder shortly after the incident, and in December a judge upgraded the charge to first-degree murder. Fields is set to stand trial on those charges in November.

The federal indictment returned Wednesday revealed new details in the case.

It indicates that Fields demonstrated a history of racism having expressed and promoted his belief that white people are superior to other races and peoples via multiple social media accounts.

And as Fields prepared to leave his home in Maumee, Ohio, to drive to the Unite the Right rally some 550 miles away, prosecutors say he sent an ominous message to a relative.

A family member had texted him, urging him to be careful.

Were not the ones who need to be careful, Fields responded, according to the indictment. Attached to the message was an image of Adolf Hitler.

Fields arrived in Charlottesville on Saturday, prosecutors say, and participated in the rally, chanting racist and anti-Semitic slogans.

He then returned to his car and watched a group of counterprotesters chanting and carrying signs promoting equality. As the crowd moved up Fourth Street, prosecutors say Fields reversed, then rapidly accelerated into them, only stopping once he struck another vehicle.

The Unite the Right rally was pegged as an opportunity for protesters to come out against the citys decision to remove the Robert E. Lee statue in Emancipation Park and was widely promoted as a white supremacist event.

It devolved into violence from the onset.

A torch-lit rally a night earlier on the campus of the University of Virginia, saw marchers chanting racist slogans and scuffling with counterprotesters.

The violence continued at the main event on Saturday where two Virginia State troopers also died in a helicopter crash.

Last summers violence in Charlottesville cut short a promising young life and shocked the nation, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement Wednesday. Todays indictment should send a clear message to every would-be criminal in America that we aggressively prosecute violent crimes of hate that threaten the core principles of our nation.

The rally spun out into a wider debate about race relations in the country.

President Trump faced heat for comments he made that appeared to equate the white supremacists with counterprotesters, saying theres blame on both sides for the violence.

Sessions, however, emerged as an early voice denouncing the violence and saying the car crash that killed Heyer met the standard for domestic terrorism.

Sessions opened a civil rights investigation soon after the attack.",1
"A Ringwood man was pronounced dead after being submerged under the ice of Lake Iosco for more than 10 minutes Tuesday. Frank Ferrell, 52, died upon arriving at Chilton Hospital despite life-saving efforts of emergency responders. Ferrell was one of two men who fell through the ice about 150 yards from shoreline. He was unconscious when rescue volunteers pulled him out of the water, while Theodore Andreniuk, 49, of West Milford, was rescued minutes earlier from the water in a semi-conscious state. Ferrells death is currently under investigation by the Bloomingdale Police Department and Regional Medical Examiners Office. The men were ice fishing at the time, according to Bloomingdale Police Chief Joseph Borell, when a resident of a nearby home called 911 just after noon and said a person had fallen through the ice. A second 911 call came in three minutes after the first about Ferrell in the lake. Initially, police believed just one person had fallen through the ice. Police said the men had been ice fishing since about 9 a.m. You could hear someone screaming for help out on the lake, Borell said of the emergency responders first impression of the scene. One of the men was also seen waving his hands and yelling for help, Det. Steven Caputo said in a press release. Bloomingdale Volunteer Fire Department Chief Mike Hudson said Andreniuks hands could be seen from the water as the rescue volunteers pulled him from the ice. Volunteer firefighters Michael DAmato, Mike Wanklin Jr., Steve Shattls and Chris Neuberger put on ice rescue suits to assist. We were able to get him out very quickly, Hudson said. Andreniuk was transported by Tri-Boro First Aid Squad to a medevac helicopter that landed at the Walter T. Bergen School. He was flown to Hackensack University Medical Center. As of 5 p.m., he was listed in critical but stable condition. Borell said no one else was fishing on the lake at the time and Hudson said the men appeared to have walked out on to the ice as opposed to boating. It was not known whether they were invited to fish by the nearby resident. Were still investigating as to why they were out on the lake, Borell said. Borell said the lake was not entirely frozen. There were portions of the lake that were ice-covered and there were other portions of the lake that were water, he said. He also said he would not recommend anyone enter the ice of the lakes or ponds in the borough, particularly with warmer weather recently, as it is not safe. I certainly would not recommend being on any lakes, any ice, at this time, he said. Borell said in his 26 years on the force he does not recall a person falling through ice and needing rescue in Bloomingdale. One week ago, the Bloomingdale Council decided to table enacting prohibition of ice activities, such as ice fishing, on public borough ponds. The prohibition is intended to ensure safety as the ponds, Oakwood Lake and Bogue Pond, are not monitored. Consideration of the prohibition ordinance was inspired by the deaths of two Mount Olive teenagers who fell through the ice of Budd Lake. The prohibition being considered, however, would only apply to public bodies of water and not private lakes in the borough, such as Lake Iosco. The Bloomingdale police and fire departments, New Jersey State Police, the Passaic County Sheriffs Rescue Squad and the Pompton Lakes Fire Department were among the agencies responding to the scene.

"Alt-right and other racist groups have increasingly chosen college campuses as prime vehicles for spreading hate speech, hate crimes and acts of xenophobic violence.

According to the Oregonian, Andrew Joseph Oswald was charged with two counts of criminal mischief and two counts of intimidation, which is considered a hate crime under Oregon law. Oswald placed bumper stickers with African-American slurs on the cars of two social activists who were members of the group Showing Up for Racial Justice.

This is not Oswald’s first charge; he was arrested for the same incident last week after placing bumper stickers on another person’s car in June of last year, but was released the same day.

As of Wednesday he has a $250,000 bail, and based on the reports of the Oregonian and Fox News, if he posts bail, then Oswald will be expelled from Oregon State, as well as the student-government organization he had ties to on campus. He pled not guilty, but he has a history of embracing his white nationalist values.

Cindee Lolik, the manager of the First Alternative Natural Foods Co-op, which was the setting of the hate crime, said one of her employees noticed anti-Semitic claims on the cars as well, according to the Oregonian.

Oswald was shown doing the Nazi salute and participating in a white nationalist rally in Portland, which he did not object to after being arrested. In addition, last year police stopped him after he and three other white nationalists chanted, “Diversity means fewer white people” in support of the Ku Klux Klan. Similar to the rallies in Charlottesville, Oswald uses these events and platforms to publicize his white nationalist, anti-minority values and his support for the Ku Klux Klan.

There is a growing number of people who support white nationalist values, such as Oswald, and use their voices on college campuses to promote their ideology.

In addition to the large alt-right rally in Charlottesville last year, which took place on University of Virginia grounds, campuses throughout the state have become hotbeds of racial intolerance. Hate groups see colleges as places to introduce their beliefs under the guise of promoting open-mindedness and political debate. Students in college are also often impressionable and thus prime targets for extremist concepts to take root.

At NYU, someone wrote “Hasta Luego DREAMers” on a poster in the Bobst Library, which then turned into a rally of love and respect for all immigrants in response. In Texas, Texas State University has been the recipient of multiple flyer campaigns promoting racial acrimony.

These values are divisive rather than inclusive to the diverse college communities around the world, lead to a pattern of hate and need to be stopped.",1

"From the Plymouth County District Attorneys office. A jury has convicted a Rhode Island man for the 2010 murder of a brother and sister in Brockton, Plymouth County District Attorney Timothy J. Cruz has announced. After a 7-day trial, a jury deliberated eight hours before finding John V. Monteiro, 31, guilty of First Degree Murder in the deaths of Maria DePina, 26, and Jorge DePina, 30, of Brockton. Monteiro was additionally convicted on one count each of Unlawful Possession of a Firearm, Armed Home Invasion, and the Sale or Transfer of a Firearm. Brockton Superior Court Judge Richard Chin sentenced Monteiro to life without the possibility of parole. On January 21, 2010, at approximately 9:16 a.m., Brockton and State Police responded to the scene of a double homicide at 52 Nilsson Street in Brockton. Upon arrival, inside the second floor apartment, police located the deceased body of a male, identified as Jorge DePina in a bed in the rear bedroom. His sister, Maria DePina was found on the kitchen floor. Both suffered gunshot wounds to the head. An autopsy revealed that the cause of death for Maria DePina was a gunshot wound to the head with perforation of the skull and brain. The cause of death for Jorge DePina was gunshot wounds to the head/neck/torso with perforation of the skull and brain. State Police Detectives assigned to the Plymouth County District Attorneys Office and the Brockton Police conducted an investigation, which found that Monteiro forced his way into the 52 Nilsson Street apartments and shot the victims in the head. The investigation further found that Monteiro later sold the gun used in the murders to an informant working with the FBI. The firearm was turned over to the State Police for ballistics and DNA testing. The testing results showed that the firearm sold by Monteiro was the gun used in the murders of Jorge and Maria DePina. On that morning, Mr. Monteiro entered the DePina home and stood over Jorges sleeping body and fired three shots, DA Cruz said. Maria was getting ready for work, heard the commotion and met up with Mr. Monteiro in the hallway. Mr. Monteiro shot Maria in the back of the head as she tried to get away. This was a brutal crime that decimated a family and stunned the Brockton community.  Throughout the trial, State Police and Brockton Police were forced to maintain a presence in the Brockton Superior Courthouse due to tension amongst supporters of the victims and the defendant. This was a particularly tough case, and I want to commend those with the courage to come forward on this case, DA Cruz said. With their help, an extremely dangerous man is now off of the streets and we have hopefully gained some justice for the DePina family. After the verdicts were read in court today, Monteiro asked for a bench trial on the two charges of Unlawful Possession of a Firearm, Subsequent Offense and Sale or Transfer of a Firearm, Subsequent Offense. Judge Chin found Monteiro guilty and sentenced him to serve 5-7 years in State Prison on the charges.",0
"The Orange County Sheriffs Department will step up Bicycle and Pedestrian Safety Enforcement Operations on Friday with focused enforcement on collision causing factors involving motorists, pedestrians and bicyclists. On June 17, extra officers will be on duty patrolling areas where bike and pedestrian traffic and crashes occur in an effort to lower deaths and injuries. The department has mapped out locations over the past seven years where pedestrian and bike collisions have occurred along, with the violations that led to those crashes, Lt. Mark Stichter said. Officers will be looking for violations made by drivers, bike riders and pedestrians alike that can lead to life changing injuries. Special attention will be directed toward drivers speeding, making illegal turns, failing to stop for signs and signals, failing to yield to pedestrians in cross walks or any other dangerous violation. Additionally, enforcement will be taken for observed violations when pedestrians cross the street illegally or fail to yield to drivers who have the right of way, he said. Bicycle and pedestrian fatalities are rising in California as more people use these non-motorized means of transportation, he said. The Orange County Sheriffs Department has investigated 26 fatal and injury collisions involving pedestrians and bicyclists during the past three years. In 2013, California witnessed 701 pedestrians and 141 bicyclists killed, accounting for more than 28 percent of all traffic fatalities. And dont be surprised if you are pulled over while riding your bike. Riders under 18-years-old must wear helmets by law. Pedestrians should cross the street only in marked crosswalks or at corners. Bike riders will be stopped and citations issued when they fail to follow the same traffic laws that apply to motorists, he said. All riders are reminded to always wear a helmet. Funding for this program is provided by a grant from the California Office of Traffic Safety through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.",0

"HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A white former Connecticut university student accused of smearing body fluids on her black roommates belongings has avoided a hate crimes charge.

Prosecutors did not file additional charges Monday against 18-year-old Brianna Brochu, of Harwinton.

The state NAACP and other civil rights advocates had asked the state to add a hate crimes charge to the criminal mischief and breach of peace counts Brochu faces.

Police say the former University of Hartford student wrote on Instagram in October about rubbing used tampons on her roommates backpack and putting her roommates toothbrush where the sun doesnt shine. Her roommate says she developed throat pain.

Prosecutors say theyre still investigating. The case has been continued until Jan. 29.

Brochu left the courthouse without commenting. Her lawyer has said her actions were not racially motivated.

"SONOMA COUNTY, CA -- A bank robbery occurred Tuesday in Sonoma, according to the Sonoma County Sheriffs Office. Authorities say the robbery was reported shortly after noon at Rabobank, 10 Maple St., and that the suspect was last seen walking southbound on Broadway, away from Rabobank. After reviewing surveillance images from the bank, sheriffs detectives believe the alleged robber is possibly a Hispanic man, rather than a black man as initially described, in his early- to mid-30s. The suspect is about 5 feet 9 or 5 feet 10 inches tall and was wearing a dark-colored baseball cap, a mesh mask over his face, and a long-sleeved olive green T-shirt with a dark-colored wings and stars design on the front, police said.

"Richard Collins III was killed on Saturday while visiting friends at the University of Maryland. His killer belonged to a hate group called Alt-Reich Nation on Facebook.

Richard Collins III was 23 and seemed like he had everything to live for. He was due to graduate from Bowie State University in Maryland on Tuesday with a degree in business, and had just been commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army. He was visiting friends at the University of Maryland this weekend when his life was tragically cut short by what the police and FBI are investigating as a possible hate crime.

Collins was waiting with two other students for an Uber ride outside the Montgomery Hall dormitory on Regents Drive near U.S. 1 at about 3 a.m. Saturday when he was attacked. The stabbing was captured by a surveillance camera, police said. They called it unprovoked. Witnesses said the suspect was intoxicated and incoherent at the time of the attack, police said. Police have said the victim and suspect did not know each other. Officers called to the scene found Collins wounded on the sidewalk, police said. He was taken to a hospital, where he died.

Sean Urbanski, 22, has been charged with first-degree murder in the stabbing death of Collins. What originally seemed to be a random and very unfortunate killing could now be tied to Urbanski’s membership in a racist group on Facebook.

The group, called Alt-Reich Nation, contained racist posts, [University Police Chief David Mitchell said.] When I look at the information thats contained on that website, suffice it to say that its despicable, it shows extreme bias against women, Latinos, persons of Jewish faith and especially African-Americans, Mitchell said. The FBI digital forensics team will look for information online that sheds light on the case, Mitchell said.

This is devastating for Collins’ family, who now has to arrange for a funeral for their loved one instead of celebrating his graduation. But it’s also yet another reminder for black people that we are not truly safe anywhere, especially on predominantly white college campuses.",1

"The victim in an armed robbery that occurred Thursday morning on E. Myrtle Street was also sexually assaulted, according to police. Mark Bergin of the Alexandria Police Department said at 10 a.m. a man wearing a mask covering his nose to his chin approached a 30-year-old woman while she was parking her van in the unit block of E. Myrtle Street near its intersection with Braddock Road. The suspect showed the woman a black, semiautomatic pistol and demanded money. He then asked the woman to step out of the vehicle. The two met at the front of the van and the suspect put his arm around the woman, who handed him her cash. She was touched inappropriately, which is considered sexual battery, Bergin said. The suspect walked away and the woman drove off and called the police.

An Indiana State freshman believes one of her floor mates in Mills Hall targeted her with a hate crime. In a Facebook post, McKensie Glover showed a photo of hair and a sanitary pad taped to her door, along with an accompanying note reading black lives dont matter.

Glover says another African-American girl on her floor received the same message last month. She believes this is fallout from an argument she had with another person in her dormitory. The university reportedly is investigating the person they believe may be responsible.

Glover says the experience has not soured her on school. She plans to finish out her full four years.",1
"PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) – The suspect in a Portland hate crime against a Muslim couple has plead no contest to a pair of charges stemming from the 2017 incident, saying that participation in social media stoked his anger leading up to the crime.

Portland police arrested Fredrick Sorrell Harmes, 49, in 2017 after he allegedly followed a Muslim couple in his car, shouting threats and vulgar invective directed at the woman’s religious garments, and telling them to leave the country.

The charges were filed under Oregon’s bias crime statue, the state’s equivalent of a hate crime law, said B.J. Park, the Multnomah deputy district attorney who prosecuted the case. Both were for misdemeanor intimidation, and together carry a maximum sentence of just under two years.",1
"STAFFORD, VA — An older man was allegedly held hostage and assaulted at his home for five days, while forced to use his ATM card to get money and make big-ticket credit card purchases, according to the Stafford County Sheriffs Office. The two suspects were arrested after a bank employee tipped investigators off on Thursday. Jamhal Blanks, 28, of Windsor Road in Stafford, and Brianna Archie, 18, of Dillwyn Court in Woodbridge, were charged with extortion by threat and abduction to extort money. Shortly before 9 a.m., deputies received a call from an employee at the BB&T bank at 760 Warrenton Road. The worker said a female witness outside in the parking lot near the ATM told her the victim made some sort of indication he was being robbed, after which she saw the victim leave in a car with a younger male and she wrote down the vehicles license plate number. That led to police to Cynthias Place, where the vehicle was registered. Police say they knocked on the door and were greeted by a disheveled and quite nervous older man. He then stepped outside and told them of his ordeal — and that his alleged abductors were still inside. The victim was treated for broken bones and lacerations, according to a sheriffs office statement. Photos: Stafford County Sheriffs Office",0
"BOISE – The Idaho Anne Frank Human Rights Memorial has been defaced with racist and anti-Semitic graffiti three times in the past week, causing extensive damage to marble tablets at the memorial.

Boise Police Chief Bill Bones told the Idaho Statesman on Thursday that the attacks are being treated as a hate crime.

“There’s an obligation to call this what it is. It’s a cowardly act. It’s a criminal act,” he said. “The words that they wrote are obviously attacks against people that live in this community simply based on the religion they practice or the color of their skin.”

The Wassmuth Center for Human Rights, which operates the memorial in partnership with Boise city parks department and has its offices next door, reported an outpouring of community support, including two individual donors who came to the center’s office and donated $20,000 apiece on Thursday – the estimated cost to replace two marble tables damaged in the first of the three incidents. Two online fund-raising drives are raising thousands more.

Dan Prinzing, the center’s director, told the Statesman, “We are being told, ‘Yes, repair. Yes, replace. But also: Enhance. Build more.’ It’s been an overwhelming response.”

The memorial is an educational park dedicated in 2002, funded by contributions from more than 3,000 individuals and corporations. Schoolchildren across the state collected coins to fund a life-sized, $42,000 bronze sculpture of Anne Frank, the young holocaust victim whose diary is among the world’s most widely read books and has been translated into more than 60 languages. In her diary, Frank famously wrote, “I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.”

The site functions as an outdoor classroom, a place of contemplation, a tourist attraction, a gathering place and a monument.

Located along the Boise River Greenbelt in downtown Boise, the memorial features the statue of Anne, peering out a window; inspiring quotes from more than 60 of the world’s humanitarian leaders; benches and reading areas; marble tablets engraved with the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, one of the few places in the world where the full declaration is on permanent public display; waterfalls; reflecting ponds; serene landscaping; and several other features aimed at contemplation, inspiration and human rights. It is the only permanent Anne Frank memorial in the United States.

The Statesman noted that the vandalism at the Anne Frank memorial follows other racist vandalism in Boise in recent months: In December, a racist slur was written in the snow on the roof of a storage shed at the Black History Museum; and in the fall, a Black Lives Matter homecoming float at Boise State University was targeted.

The New York City-based Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect announced that it will send a team to Boise in response to the incidents; the team will include actors to perform “Letters from Anne and Martin,” a play featuring writings from Anne Frank and Martin Luther King Jr., on May 24.

New budget director named

The Idaho Legislature’s longtime budget director, Cathy Holland-Smith, is retiring after nearly 30 years with the state, the last 10 as the director of the Legislature’s nonpartisan Division of Budget and Policy. Her last day was Friday. On Monday, Paul Headlee, who has been a nonpartisan staffer with the Legislature for 15 years, the last three as deputy budget director, will take over as director. Headlee is well-known to state lawmakers as the legislative budget analyst for the public schools budget. That duty will be taken over by budget analyst Robyn Lockett.

“I know that Paul will be terrific in his new position,” said Legislative Services Director Eric Milstead, in an email informing lawmakers of the move.

Headlee has named budget analyst Keith Bybee as his deputy director, and is in the process of hiring several new budget analysts. He noted that with the retirements of Holland-Smith, longtime analyst Richard Burns last year, and longtime analyst Ray Houston coming in July, the office is losing a combined 90 years of experience.

“We have some good folks here. We have a good corps of senior staff that are going to help the junior staff as they come on board,” Headlee said. “We have some pretty big tasks ahead. And as long as everybody will bear with us a little while we make all the assignment changes, we’ll be learning from each other.”

Candidates already sparring…

When Steve Yates, who recently stepped down as executive director of the Idaho Republican Party, filed preliminary paperwork with the Idaho Secretary of State’s office last week for a run for lieutenant governor, it reminded me of comments last month from another candidate for the same post, Sen. Marv Hagedorn, R-Meridian. After a column by Chuck Malloy in Idaho Politics Weekly speculated that Yates entering the race likely would chase away other potential candidates and that Hagedorn, who at that time was the only announced candidate, “might want to rethink his plans,” Hagedorn responded on Facebook:

“Having been an Idahoan most of my life, growing up with Idahoans and having lived in both northern and southern Idaho has provided me a perspective of why we are who we are. I’ve appreciated Steve’s efforts to bring our party together (as a volunteer in a part-time job), but three years dealing with party officials doesn’t give one the perspective of what Idaho is and who Idahoans really are. There will be more good candidates entering this race who I consider my friends, and I look forward to debating and traveling all over the state with them, and communicating our experiences letting Idahoans decide who will be the best person to provide back-up and guidance to whoever our new governor will be!”

It’s a crowded race already. Since then, Rep. Kelley Packer, R-McCammon, and former Rep. Janice McGeachin, R-Idaho Falls, both have entered the race and launched their campaigns. Former Constitution Party gubernatorial candidate Steve Pankey of Twin Falls also has filed as a Republican for the post.

Idaho’s lieutenant governor, a part-time position, presides over the Senate and serves as acting governor when the governor is outside the state or incapacitated. Other duties depend on those delegated or assigned by the governor.

Current Lt. Gov. Brad Little has held the post since 2009. It’s opening up next year because he’s running for governor.

April tax revenues beat forecasts

Idaho state tax revenues in April came in 2.4 percent ahead of forecasts, at $537 million. That’s 5.9 percent higher than last year’s April figures and is significant as April is the biggest revenue month of the year, since it’s when people file their income tax returns. With the April revenues in, year-to-date tax revenues to Idaho’s general fund are $2.9 billion, 1.8 percent ahead of forecasts and 7.8 percent higher than last year at the same point.

Even so, individual income taxes, the largest component of April’s revenues, came in half a percentage point below the forecast. Both sales taxes and corporate income taxes beat forecasts, as did smaller revenue categories, boosting the total, according to the governor’s Division of Financial Management.

Meanwhile, the Legislative Budget Office reports that the estimated ending balance at the end of the current fiscal year stands at $76.4 million, $2.9 million higher than was anticipated when lawmakers adjourned their legislative session in March. With this year’s successful legislation to extend a “surplus eliminator” law, any general fund year-end balance that exceeds the ending balance set by the Legislature will be divided equally between the Budget Stabilization Fund, which is the state’s main rainy-day savings fund, and road projects.

Since the Legislature set that ending balance at $73.4 million, the amount now built up for purposes of the surplus-eliminator is $2.9 million.",1

As the KKK and neo-Nazis have made headlines with President Trump’s controversial comments on hate groups, Los Angeles police reported Friday that local hate crimes increased in the city in the first half of the year.

And officials said that’s a nationwide trend.

The Los Angeles Police Department reported a 12.6 percent increase in hate crimes in the first half of 2017, 161 compared to 143 over the same period last year, while violent hate crimes climbed from 24 to 36, according to the Los Angeles Times, which cited data collected by Cal State San Bernardino’s Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism.

The rise in 2017 comes after the city experienced a total of 230 hate crimes in 2016, which was a 15 percent increase over the previous year and the highest number in the city since 2008.

Of the six largest cities in the nation — New York, L.A., Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia and Phoenix — all except Houston have seen a rise in hate crimes in 2017, The Times reported.

"A Bellevue police officer is currently under investigation for failing to intervene at the scene of a hate crime. Documents charging the suspect, Robert Panera, with malicious harassment detail the officer’s inaction on January 23.

Bellevue PD spokesperson Officer Seth Tyler told KING 5 that a complaint was filed against Detective Jim Lindquist and an ongoing internal investigation is in its final stages.

If the allegation is true, there would violations of department policy, but we dont know that yet, said Bellevue Police Chief Steve Mylett.

The incident unfolded around 2:30 p.m. at the Bellevue Transit Center.

Lindquist was in the area, working as an off-duty flagger at a construction site.

Panera was hurling racial slurs and making threats towards African-American people, according to documents. But that’s not what he said told dispatchers when he called 911.

Three Bellevue officers responded to the transit center and contacted Lindquist. The charging documents say Lindquist “was initially dealing with the parties involved,” but the incident was handed off to the on-duty officers.

The officers spoke to Panera and an “older black male,” who Lindquist told the other officers were involved in an altercation and a third male that took off on a bus, according to charging documents.

They spoke with both men, but “were not able to develop probable cause for a crime that involved the two.” An informational report was filed by one of the officers.

Later that day, the male that left the scene on the bus made contact with a Bellevue Police captain to share his account of the afternoon and say that Panera’s statement was incorrect. Over a phone call, he told the captain he began recording a disturbance between Panera and the other male. Panera saw the caller, who is African-American, recording and began yelling at him, according to documents.

The caller told the captain he approached Lindquist to get assistance. Panera continued to yell racial slurs and even lunged at him, say the documents, until “Panera suddenly stopped, turned and walked away.”

The caller said he felt unsafe and immediately boarded a bus to leave the scene and called 911 once he felt safe back at his home. He provided the police captain with four video recordings, according to the documents.

A witness at the scene told police she saw Panera yelling racial slurs at several people. “He singled out each African American, pointed at them” and yelled at them, according to the charging documents. The witness told the captain she observed Lindquist tell the victim, “this happens all the time.”

According to charging documents, Lindquist failed to tell the responding officers about the racial slurs or threats made by Panera.

If [officers] are in uniform and theyre providing that service, theyre on duty and subject to respond and take appropriate action whether theyre on the clock here or working an off-duty job, said Mylett.

With the changing face of Bellevues population, Mylett says hes even more aware of the importance of public trust in the police department. Non-whites now make up the majority of the city.

Were on our way to building trust in all communities that make up Bellevue, but its fragile. and all it takes is one incident to either set us back 3, 5, 10 years or lose trust altogether, Mylett said.

Mylett says while he owes his detective due process, he owes the public the truth.

I will report back to the community exactly what I find, he said.

"A plastic tub with a significant amount of suspected blood and a quilt with suspected blood may explain why police think Burnsville college student Anarae Schunk was killed in a Rosemount townhouse where Ashley M. Conrade lived with Shavelle Chavez-Nelson, the Star Tribune reported. Chavez-Nelson has not been charged in the Schunk case, although he is a suspect. A Dakota County Grand Jury indicted Chavez-Nelson, also known as Anthony Lee Nelson, with first-degree murder (premeditation) and second-degree murder (intentional) in the death of Palagor Obang Jobi, 23. Jobi died from multiple gun shot wounds early on Sept. 22. Jobi and Nelson were fighting over Chavez-Nelsons girlfriend when witnesses reported hearing gunshots, according to the complaint and a Dakota County Attorneys Office news release. Schrunk, who was with Chavez-Nelson and Conrade at the bar, went missing that same night and was found dead Sept. 31. Ashley Conrade, 24, has also been charged with aiding an offender on suspicion that she harbored Chavez-Nelson at her Rosemount townhouse. The Star Tribune reported that a newly released search warrant affidavit details how officers found the tub in the rafters of the townhouses garage. The quilt was inside the tub. The warrant also stated the Schunks cell phone records showed that she had talked to Chavez-Nelson before the shooting. Click here to read the full article.",0
"A flyer circulating around England and possibly the U.S. is calling for people to attack Muslims. Unconfirmed rumors say the flyer has appeared on the Lane Community College campus. KLCC’s Brian Bull reports on how local Muslims are responding.

The flyer declares April 3rd to be “Punish a Muslim Day”, and assigns increasing point values for attacks ranging from spitting in Muslim’s faces to destroying Mecca.

At the University of Oregon, members of the Muslim Student Association set up a table with informative pamphlets on Islam and took questions from people curious about their culture and religion.

Junior Fama Gdi says it’s to inform and make a statement.

“We’re Muslim and proud, despite how much people hate us for simply practicing a different faith, Gdi tells KLCC. So just kinda to say that we’re out here, we’re not scared.”

Another student, Abdullah Al-shbanah, says he’s concerned about calls to violence that have been made in the flyer.

“Many people actually take actions into that, so that’s really sad, he says. And that’s why we’re doing what we’re doing now.”

Meanwhile, the Eugene Islamic Center says the FBI warned them of the “Punish A Muslim Day” flyer, and that police patrols would be stepped up around their building. Calls and knocks on the Center’s doors went unanswered.

"British authorities are promising to prosecute “hate crimes” committed online as vigorously as those that take place face-to-face, claiming that online hate crime is a major problem.

New Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) guidelines issued Monday outlined a tough stance on “hate attacks” on Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms on the basis of race, religion, disability, sexual orientation or “transgender identity”.

In addition, the guidance for the first time recognizes “hate crimes” against bisexuals as distinct from homophobic or “transphobic” attacks.

“These documents take account of the current breadth and context of offending to provide prosecutors with the best possible chance of achieving justice for victims,” Alison Saunders, the director of public prosecutions, said in a statement.

“They also let victims and witnesses know what they should expect from us.”

She also said she hopes the new plans will see more prosecutions, with longer sentences for those convicted if a jury or judge can be convinced the crime was motivated by hate.

After the releasing the new guideline, the CPS’s official Twitter feed ran an online poll asking users to tell them how to respond to “hate crimes”.

They also retweeted the discredited anti-Islamophobia group TellMAMA, who were accused of inflating “hate crime” data after the 2013 Woolwick Islamist attack, to further their agenda.

How the CPS intends to crack down on online hate crime: https://t.co/qQC3Nj8dvQ #No2h8 #HateCrimeMatters — TellMAMAUK (@TellMamaUK) August 21, 2017

Reporting the story, BBC News featured an interview with a transgendered individual who claimed that being “miss-gendered” online was a damaging crime.

Saunders also told The Guardian the crackdown is needed because online abuse can lead to the sort of extremist hate seen in Charlottesville in the United States last weekend.

Writing in the paper, Saunders said: “Left unchallenged, even low-level offending can subsequently fuel the kind of dangerous hostility that has been plastered across our media in recent days. That is why countering it is a priority for the CPS.

“Whether shouted in their face on the street, daubed on their wall or tweeted into their living room, the impact of hateful abuse on a victim can be equally devastating.”

Separate “hate crime” guidelines from the CPS release in January reaffirmed that no evidence is needed to report a “hate crime”, and they only need to be “perceived” by the alleged victim.

“In order to treat a crime as a hate crime for the purposes of investigation, there is no need for evidence to prove the aggravating element”, the guidelines read.

"IDAHO FALLS, ID — Like millions of others who have ordered DNA tests from a popular genealogy website, Kelli Rowlette was curious about her family tree. But she was floored by a web of deception revealed by the test: The man she had believed to be her biological father for 36 years wasnt a genetic match. Instead, her parents fertility doctor was her likely father. Rowlette, who knew nothing of her parents struggle to conceive her, initially thought the results from the Ancestry.com test were wrong. But when she questioned her now divorced parents, Sally Ashby and Howard Fowler, about the mysterious probable genetic match, Gerald Mortimer, they knew him quite well. He had delivered Kelli Rowlette. When the family moved away, he cried. But what no one knew until the DNA test was the secret now spelled out a federal malpractice lawsuit Rowlette and her parents filed in Idaho last week against Mortimer. In it, they accuse the retired gynecologist and obstetrician living in Idaho Falls of knowingly using his own sperm in 1980 to impregnate Sally Ashby. According to the complaint, Mortimer explained to the couple the reasons for their difficulty in conceiving were twofold: She had a tipped uterus and he had a low sperm count. Mortimer prescribed artificial insemination, and said Fowlers sperm would be mixed with the sperm of a suitable donor who matched their specifications — a college student taller than 6 feet with brown hair and blue eyes. Instead, though he did not match the parents specifications for a sperm donor, he used his own sperm in the procedure that resulted in Rowlettes birth nine months later, according to the complaint. After Mortimer delivered Rowlette, he continued to provide reproductive care for her mother, who later naturally conceived a son with Fowler without Mortimers assistance. When he became emotional at the prospect of the familys move from Idaho to Washington, Dr. Mortimer knew Kelli Rowlette was his biological daughter but did not disclose this to Ms. Ashby or Mr. Fowler, the complaint states. Though the secret lay dormant for more than 30 years, Rowlettes parents were devastated when they learned Mortimer was their daughters biological father, the complaint states, and struggled to cope with their own anguish and had difficulty contemplating the torment the discovery would cause their daughter. Rowlette and her family have been suffering immeasurably since the discovery, according to the lawsuit. Obstetrics and Gynecology Associates of Idaho Falls and Mortimers wife, Linda G. McKinnon Mortimer, are also named as a defendant in the lawsuit. The family is seeking more than $75,000 in damages. Patch was unsuccessful in attempts to reach Mortimer for a comment. A spokeswoman for Obstetrics and Gynecology Associates of Idaho Falls said he is no longer associated with the practice. None of the health care providers currently at Obstetrics and Gynecology Associates of Idaho Falls were part of the practice in 1979 to 1980 and they diligently strive to provide care to their patients that is in compliance with the standards of health care practice, the spokeswoman said, reading from a prepared statement.

"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Sunayana Dumala’s husband, Srinivas Kuchibhotla, was killed a year ago in February. He was the victim of an alleged hate crime.

Kuchibhotla was killed when a suspect opened fire inside Austins Bar & Grill in Olathe, Kan. last year. The suspect allegedly yelled get out of my country! before fatally shooting Kuchibhotla and injuring two others.

RELATED | Widow shares moment she knew husband was killed in Austins shooting

When her husband died, Sunayana’s legal status in the United States passed with him. She knew it almost instantly.

“At that point in time, my head was still trying to process that what I heard was true. But that I did knew that I’d be going out of status,” she said.

“Because her husband was here on only a temporary work visa as opposed to a permanent residency, then when he was murdered, her immigration status vanished, as well,” said Rep. Kevin Yoder, U.S. Representative for the 3rd District, in which Sunayana and her husband lived.

Sunayana’s husband was here on an H-1B work visa, one given to people to come here for specialized jobs. He’d been waiting on permanent residency since 2010, and likely would’ve had to wait quite a while longer.

The U.S. currently allows 140,000 people who are in the country on employment-based visas to gain permanent residency per year.

However, the U.S. caps the number of those granted green cards to 7 percent from any one country.

Sunayana now meeting @PatrickMcHenry to explain her story. McHenry just told her “your story is a powerful one. Thank you for being willing to tell it.” ...”you are an amazing advocate”. And “I’m grateful you want to be a part of America.” pic.twitter.com/vtp7csztWy — Christa Dubill (@christadubill) January 30, 2018

This means no more than 9,800 green cards are granted to people from any one country.

Some countries don’t have nearly as many people here on work visas, so people applying for permanent residency move through the system faster. India, on the other hand, has hundreds of thousands of people here on work visas, so many are on the waitlist for permanent residency.

“If Sunayana and her husband had been from any other country in the world, she would already be a United States citizen,” said Yoder.

For 10 months, Sunayana filled out paperwork, worked with legislators like Yoder, worked with her employer and her husband’s employer and attorneys to try and get her own work visa.

Now @KevinYoder follows up with why his bill HR392 is so important.

McHenry then says to Dumala “I’ll remember you as we’re having these discussions” pic.twitter.com/nTfybcZGjB — Christa Dubill (@christadubill) January 30, 2018

Finally, on Jan. 3, 2017, she got a call from her attorney.

“At 10:30 at night, she calls me and she says, ‘Sunayana! It’s approved,’” Sunayana recalled with excitement.

Sunayana now has her own work visa and can apply for permanent residency.

She’ll be on the wait list with all others from India here on work visas.

Yoder wants this to change. He has introduced a bill that would change several things about the immigration process, including the 7 percent cap. It’s called House Resolution 392.

“What I’m pushing to do is to have this bill debated on the House floor. Give it its moment in the sun. Give these people a chance to be heard and have their voices heard in the Halls of Congress,” said Yoder.

“You’ve followed all the laws. You’ve followed all the rules. You’ve paid your taxes. You’ve immigrated to this country as a guest worker under the laws that we’ve set forth. You’ve followed all of them, yet you’re constantly put in the back of the line,” said Yoder.

Sunayana wants to see this change.

“Maybe at this point of time, I would’ve just focused on rebuilding my life rather than trying to fight for my status in the country,” said Sunayana.

Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, the Democratic Co-Chair of the bipartisan Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans, spoke with Sunayana.

"Federal investigators say a 19-year-old former St. Catherine University student tried to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization in September.

"Warning: Graphic language

A Muslim couple was harassed in Northeast Portland Friday by a man who allegedly shouted at them to go back to your f—ing country before making hand gestures that resembled him pulling the trigger on a handgun, the Council on American-Islamic Relations said.

Part of the incident occurred near the corner of Northeast 102nd Avenue and Glisan Street, CAIR-Oregon committee member Zakir Khan told The Oregonian/OregonLive.

Given the recent deadly attack in Portland, we urge the mayor and local law enforcement authorities to swiftly apprehend the alleged perpetrator and to bring any appropriate hate crime charges, Khan said in a news release.

Portland Police Bureau spokesman Sgt. Pete Simpson said a report has been filed by the victim and that the incident is under investigation by biased crime unit detectives.

The incident came in the week following the fatal stabbing of two men on a MAX train by a man who had allegedly barked racial slurs at two teenage girls, one of whom was wearing a hijab.

Simpson said the bureau couldnt offer details because of the ongoing investigation but that police have been in touch with CAIR.

The extent to which one Connecticut student was allegedly willing to go to harass her black roommate has gripped headlines, and many activists have called for the aggressor to face hate crime charges.

But when ex-University of Hartford student Brianna Brochu, 18, appeared in court on Tuesday, prosecutors signaled that a hate crime count was unlikely to be added to her charges of misdemeanor criminal mischief and breach of peace, according to the Associated Press.

In an Instagram post bragging about how she contaminated her roomate Jazzy Rowe’s belongings, Brochu wrote: “After one and a half months spitting in her coconut oil, putting moldy clam dip in her lotions, rubbing used tampons on her backpack, putting her toothbrush places where the sun doesn’t shine, and so much more, I can finally say goodbye to Jamaican Barbie.”

"LeBron James has had a tough morning. Someone went and vandalized his house, with an added side of racist nonsense. Ugh.





According to HollywoodLife.com, the Los Angeles Police Department says that “around 6:44am today, May 31st, West LA officers received a vandalism call at a residence”. Guess whose home it was…





Oh and they added that a “racial slur was painted on a private gate and when officers arrived the slur was already painted over by the property manager. The incident is being investigated and the officers have confirmed it is LeBron James’ home that was vandalized.”





Authorities told TMZ Sports that they are looking into this as a possible hate crime. Let’s be honest though, the vandals painted a racial slur The N-Word; it’s a hate crime.





They are also searching for security footage from neighbors, in the hopes that these cameras captured the perpetrators committing the crime.





Hey, person or people who did this! You’re terrible. Hope those fumes messed up your brain a bit.















Sadly enough, this isn’t an isolated incident.

Lebron spoke out about his experience with being heckled with racist comments back in May, stating “Racism, we know, exists. You try not to put yourself in a position, for me as a father, I try to give my kids the blueprint on how life is gonna be […] But at the end of the day, I can only tell them so much, and they have to live it themselves. For me, I just try to be respectful, for one, respectful to others, and I feel like if you do that consistently, then I believe the karma will come back to you.”

In less depressing news though, apparently T.I. and Kevin Hart are teaming up to bring the world a music-based comedy series , so we all have that to look forward to.

"ATMORE, AL — Torrey Twane McNabb raised his middle fingers as he was put to death Thursday night for the killing of a cop. McNabbs attorneys had unsuccessfully sought to stop the execution since he was one of several inmates in an ongoing lawsuit challenging the humaneness of the states lethal injection procedure. Before he was put to death, he cursed the state and said: I hate you. McNabb was convicted of killing Montgomery police officer Anderson Gordon in 1997. He shot Gordon five times as the officer sat in his patrol car after arriving at a traffic accident McNabb caused while fleeing a bail bondsman, prosecutors said. Watch: Man Executed For Killing Alabama Police Officer Gordons relatives said in a statement that the 30-year-old officer — known as Brother — was devoted to his family, his two children and his work as a police officer. Over 20 years ago, we lost a companion, a father, a brother and friend who only wanted to make a difference in his community, the statement read. Although, the wounds of having a family member murdered can never be healed, through this tragedy, the Gordon family has remained strong and will continue to be resilient. The inmates in the lawsuit have argued that the sedative midazolam does not reliably render a person unconscious before subsequent drugs stop their lungs and heart. They point to an execution last December during which an Alabama inmate coughed and heaved for the first 13 minutes of the procedure. McNabb appeared to be breathing for the first 20 minutes of the 35-minute long procedure. He later appeared to move his head, grimace and raise his arms after two consciousness checks in which a guard pinches his arm, says his name and pulls back his eyelid — before eventually becoming still. His family members and attorneys who witnessed the execution expressed repeated concerns to each other that he was still conscious during the lethal injection. Hes going to wake up, one of McNabbs family members whispered. He was pronounced dead at 9:38 p.m. CDT, authorities said. Alabama Commissioner Jeff Dunn said he was confident the movements after the second consciousness check were involuntary and that McNabb was not awake. A lawyer for McNabb argued that it would be wrong to carry out the execution while proceedings continue in McNabbs lawsuit. The state argued that the inmates are unlikely to prevail in their claims since the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed other executions, including four in Alabama, to proceed using midazolam. The attorney generals office argued McNabb had presented nothing new to justify a stay. The U.S. Supreme Court delayed the execution for more than two hours to consider McNabbs request for a stay, but ruled that the execution could go forward.

"LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) – Los Angeles County saw a 67 percent increase in hate crimes where there was evidence of white supremacist ideology over the previous year, according to a report released Thursday.

The Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations 2016 Hate Crime Report tracked 482 hate crimes, one less than in 2015. Despite the total number of crimes remaining nearly identical, the 2015 numbers were a 24 percent increase from the previous year and the highest total since 2011. Because of this, the report concluded that hate crimes continued to be “elevated” in 2016.

The report also noted that, for the first time in many years, the largest group targeted was people from the LGBTQ community, surpassing crimes against African-Americans.

The L.A. County Commission on Human Relations has compiled the annual report since 1980, and although it concluded that hate crimes are elevated compared to recent years, the 482 reported crimes were far fewer than in some previous years, such as the 1,031 reported in 2001 and the 995 in 1996.

Officials involved in compiling the report noted the spike in white supremacist crimes among its most troubling findings, and some pointed to President Donald Trump, viewed by some critics as supportive of white supremacists and anti-Latino, anti-Muslim and anti-LGBTQ, as a top reason for the increase.

The commission said it was contacted repeatedly by press and concerned officials wanting to know if the county experienced an increase in hate crimes after the 2016 presidential election in November, so it compiled a special report on the issue and found that hate crimes rose from election day through the end of the year by 9 percent compared with the same time period in 2015.

L.A. County Supervisor Hilda Solis, who represents the 1st District that stretches from downtown L.A. to Pomona and Claremont, said the rise of white supremacist crimes” is of a particular concern to me because I see it in my southeastern part of my own district. In fact, over the last several months we have had to alert the sheriff’s department because white supremacists and anti- immigrant groups have been disruptive in communities like Cudahy and disrupting the City Council meetings. Residents are fearful to attend these meetings because these groups have shown up.”

Other noteworthy findings from the report included:

— Hate crimes against African-Americans dropped by 19 percent, from 139 to 112, partly due to a drop in the number of hate crimes by Latino gang members targeting African-Americans.

— The 118 reported homophobic crimes had a high rate of violence (81 percent), and included one murder of a gay man shot to death by his father, who has since been convicted in the killing.

— Gender-based crimes spiked by 77 percent, from 22 to 39, with most being anti-transgender crimes, which jumped from 18 to 31.

— There were 101 religious hate crimes, with two-thirds targeting the Jewish community, although overall reports fell by 2 percent compared to 2015.

— After jumping 69 percent in 2015, anti-Latino crimes increased slightly in 2016, from 61 to 62, and 77 percent of them were violent.

— Anti-white crimes jumped from 11 to 27, a 145 percent rise, with the report noting that whites are 27 percent of the population and composed 11 percent of racial hate crime victims.

— Youth under 18 continue to decline as suspects in hate crimes, and went from the largest age group of suspects to the smallest from 2006 to 2016.

"(Newser) – The weekend might have started with a devastating act of hate, but it ended with an outpouring of love. That from the manager of Sunset Hill Cemetery in Glen Carbon, Ill., 20 miles northeast of St. Louis, where more than 1,400 veterans are buried. Early Saturday, a building and some 200 gravestones were found vandalized with spray-painted swastikas. In nearby Edwardsville, dozens of homes, vehicles, signs, and mailboxes were marked in the same way, per the Alton Telegraph. Cemetery manager Jeanne Brunette described tears and disillusionment and disappointment days before a 29th annual Memorial Day ceremony to be attended by hundreds, per the New York Times. We havent seen anything of this magnitude in the 30 years that Ive been here, the grounds superintendent adds, per KMOV.

The son of a veteran noted the swastikas were especially upsetting as the majority of the people buried up here that were in the service fought during World War II, per KSDK. But thanks to volunteers and local businesses that donated food and products, the swastikas were erased from view in time for Mondays event. An arrest had also been made by that time. A 34-year-old white male was taken into custody Saturday afternoon after Edwardsville police shared a surveillance video showing a person leaving the vandalized area. Described as previously known to police, Timothy VA Mclean of Glen Carbon is expected to be charged with a hate crime and institutional vandalism, per the Telegraph. The fact that he did this on Memorial Day weekend is inexcusable and disgusting behavior that were not going to tolerate, a police rep tells the Times.

"A Lake County deputy is credited with saving the life of a Green Oaks man who overdosed on heroin over the weekend , police said Monday. Deputies from the Lake County Sheriffs Office responded to the 14000 block of Shanklin Court in Green Oaks at about 9:50 p.m. Saturday where they found an unresponsive man in his bedroom, according to a sheriffs office press release. A family member, who was a nurse, started CPR on the male because his heart had stopped, according to the news release. Sheriffs Deputy Amanda Fosco learned the male may be suffering from an opiate overdose. She administered a dose of Naloxone, or Narcan, which is an opiate-reversal drug, and the victim began to breathe on his own. He became conscious a short time later, according to the news release. He was transported to Advocate Condell Hospital for treatment. It was later learned that he had ingested heroin and it is believed that he suffered an overdose as a result, according to the news release.  Dep. Foscos quick recognition of the situation due to her recent training in the use of Naloxone and the issuance of the Naloxone auto-injector were instrumental in saving the mans life, according to the news release.

Los Angeles County saw a spike of 67 percent in hate crimes in 2016 where there was evidence of white supremacist ideology, compared with the previous year, according to a report released Thursday.

The Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations 2016 Hate Crime Report tracked 482 hate crimes, one less than in 2015. Despite the total number of crimes remaining nearly identical, the 2015 numbers were a 24 percent increase from the previous year and the highest total since 2011. Because of this, the report concluded that hate crimes continued to be “elevated” in 2016.

The report also noted that for the first time in many years, the largest group targeted was people from the LGBTQ community, surpassing crimes against African-Americans.

Officials involved in compiling the report noted the spike in white supremacist crimes among its most troubling findings, and some pointed to President Donald Trump — viewed by some critics as supportive of white supremacists and anti-Latino, anti-Muslim and anti-LGBTQ — as a top reason for the increase.

“He bolsters these groups to give them validation, and they feel emboldened and they can go out and march and organize. And you are seeing a rise,” said Salam Al-Marayati, president of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, to City News Service after a news conference at the Kenneth Hahn Hall of Administration. “I was at a law enforcement summit yesterday, and the whole talk was about white supremacists.”

The commission said it was contacted repeatedly by press and concerned officials wanting to know if the county experienced an increase in hate crimes after the 2016 presidential election in November, so it compiled a special report on the issue and found that hate crimes rose from election day through the end of the year by 9 percent compared with the same time period in 2015.

One documented incident after the election involved an Asian woman walking her dog in Woodland Hills being yelled at from a car by two white males, who called her a number of racist names before yelling “Trump town!” A family in Montrose found a swastika, anti-Latino graffiti and the word “Trump” spray-painted on their home, along with a threatening note filled with racist words and rhetoric.

“The fact that white supremacist crimes grew 67 percent is alarming, particularly in the aftermath of the Unite the Right’ rally in Charlottesville. It seems that organized hate groups everywhere are feeling emboldened and increasingly visible,” Commission President Isabelle Gunning said.

L.A. County Supervisor Hilda Solis, who represents the 1st District that stretches from downtown L.A. to Pomona and Claremont, said the rise of white supremacist crimes” is of a particular concern to me because I see it in my southeastern part of my own district.

“We are extremely concerned that reported hate crimes remained at an elevated level in 2016,” said Robin Toma, LACCHR executive director. “And major cities across the country, including the city of Los Angeles, have already reported increases in hate crimes during the first half of 2017.”

In their opinion letter “Where is equal outrage?” Ray and Barbara Hickman wanted equal concern for Christians from the progressive left. The difference in community response to an attack on a Christian church and an attack on an Islamic mosque is because of the difference in the motivation of the attack. The destruction to the mosque was an attack against a religion and the people who adhere to that religion. As evidence, the perpetrator threw a Christian Bible onto the destruction. He made known that it was a Christian that attacked a Muslim church and may have intended some symbolism. I don’t think there is evidence that the criminals that vandalized the Church of Latter-day Saints and other churches in Fort Collins had any particular hostility toward a particular religion or ethnic group. It appears that those acts of vandalism were associated with burglary. The vandalism against the Christian churches were violence against property; the vandalism against the Islamic mosque was violence implicit against a group of people.

Further, an attack on a Christian church in a Christian-majority country is not nearly as threatening as an attack on a minority religion. The campaign rhetoric of Trump and the current administration’s policy of conflating Muslims with terrorists have incited a hostile environment for Muslims in this country. With good reason, Muslims are concerned about their safety. Christians in this country do not need to live in fear because of their religion. To equate random vandalism to Christian churches and a hate crime against a mosque is not logical. In my opinion, it is self-indulgent and petulant to demand the same compassion and concern.

"LEESBURG, VA—A 16-year-old Woodbridge girl suffered spine injuries while being restrained at North Spring Behavioral Healthcare at 42009 Victory Lane last month, and two employees have been arrested in connection with the incident, according to the Loudoun County Sheriffs Office. Its the same place where two people were charged in the death of a 15-year-old boy last November. In the latest incident, Stephen S. Holmes, 53, of Martinsburg, WV, was charged with malicious wounding and cruelty and injuries to a child. Hes being held without bond. Kara L. Mueller, 45, of Lovettsville, was charged with cruelty and injuries to a child, and was released on an unsecured bond. Investigators found that the girls injuries occurred when a restraint was incorrectly performed by Holmes on June 11. Mueller, a registered nurse, failed to intervene. In other incident, as reported by The Washington Post, Jeremiah Flemming died Nov. 19 after a mental-health worker restrained him, police said. William P. Herndon, 47, of Martinsburg, WVA, and Melanie A. Lewis, 47, of Stephens City, were charged with involuntary manslaughter. Image via LCSO",0
"Police arrested a man accused of spray-painting racist and anti-Semitic messages in Coatesville, Chester County. Police are also investigating an incident in which a suspect spray-painted racist and anti-Semitic messages on a mans vehicle in Wilmington, Delaware. NBC10s Brandon Hudson speaks to a relative of the Wilmington victim as well as a South Jersey woman who is working to spread messages of love and inclusion in the face of hatred.

An investigation is underway after a vandal spray-painted racist and anti-Semitic graffiti on a minivan in Wilmington, Delaware Wednesday morning.

Police were called to the 600 block of Bayard Avenue around 7 a.m. for a report of vandalism. When they arrived they found a van covered in spray-paint. The images included a swastika on the hood and several racial epithets, investigators said.

Police say no other vehicles in the area were damaged and at this time it appears to be an isolated incident. They are currently investigating it as a hate crime. Rodney Jackson told NBC10 the vandalized van belongs to his nephew.

It even disturbed my mom, Jackson said. My mom is 77-years-old.

Jackson said they covered the van up quickly upon discovering the vandalism so it wouldnt draw more attention. News of the incident traveled fast however and even caught the attention of Delaware Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester.

She kind of wanted to make sure were okay Jackson said.

Police say the vandalism occurred at some point overnight.

I think its over a parking space, Jackson said. All they need is God in their life.

Wilmington resident Michael Flowers told NBC10 hes always felt comfortable walking around the neighborhood and is shocked by the incident.

Im very concerned about the neighborhood, Flowers said. I really am.



The incident occurred a day after vandals spray-painted Nazi symbols, including swastikas, as well as racist language on a storefront, Mercedes Benz and a garage in the West End neighborhood of Coatesville, Chester County in Pennsylvania. A suspect, who police say had claimed past associations with white supremacist groups, was later arrested in connection to the Coatesville vandalism Wednesday night.



A recent NBC News report also revealed hate crimes in nine cities, including Philadelphia, increased 23.3 percent in 2016.

I think its absolutely terrifying that this can happen in our country, said Robin Coyne of Audubon, New Jersey.

Coyne, along with her husband Joseph Coyne, started the Camden County/South Jersey branch of Hate Has No Home Here, a grassroots campaign against hate speech that calls for community members to display signs on their lawns promoting love, peace and inclusion.

Coyne told NBC10 the recent racially-fueled events in Charlottesville, Virginia sparked renewed interest in their Hate Has No Home Here signs. They sold 50 signs two nights ago, a new record for them.

Were not going to stand for white supremacist, Neo-Nazis coming out and demonstrating like that, Coyne said. Were going to stand against them.

If you have any information on the Wilmington vandalism, please call Detective Brandon Mosely at 302-576-3646. You can also call the Delaware Crime Stoppers at 1-800-TIP-3333 or email www.delawarecrimestoppers.org.",1
"Victim Shinoy Mailackel, 36, is recovering at home with 12 stitches and 12 staples in his right arm.

A father of two jumps into action when he sees a female co-worker at his convenience store being harassed by a customer.

What he didn’t know was the customer was armed with a knife.

Now, he’s recovering from being stabbed and a Stuart homeless man is under arrest and charged with a hate crime.

Employees at the Family Dollar Discount store, 3260 SE Dixie Highway, Stuart say this alleged attacker had been in the store a few times before. But this time, he turned violent.

Shinoy Mailackel, 36, known to his friends as Matthew, is recovering at home with 12 stitches and 12 staples in his right arm.

“Hate is pure ignorance so he should not be doing this to anybody who works hard, pays taxes and supports his family,” said Mailackel.

Surveillance video shows he was slashed at the Family Dollar Discount store in Stuart where he works in what authorities call a hate crime attack.

Jeremiah Hendrix, 33, a homeless man, is under arrest for the crime.

Police say Hendrix was upset with a female clerk who he felt had overcharged him earlier in the day and he came back and was yelling at her.

That’s when Mailackel intervened.

“I told him she’s my mom, let her go bro, like that,” Mailackel said.

The husband and father of two is says the knife narrowly missed two large veins in his arm.

“I didn’t see a knife in his hand, so by the time he slashed then I start seeing the blood and I start taking care of myself,” he explained.

After the stabbing, Hendrix left the store and deputies caught him a few blocks away.

According to the arrest report, when asked why he stabbed the store clerk he replied quote: “there’s no reason other than they are (expletive) Arabs. I don’t like Arabs.”

“He thought I’m an Arab, so probably he guessed that because of my skin color I’m an Arab. But I’m not an Arab,” he said.

Mailackel says he’s originally from India and is a US citizen and a Catholic.

Hendrix is charged with a hate crime of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, a felony. A hate crime means it carries a stiffer punishment if he’s convicted.

The victim, meanwhile, says he hopes to return to work in about a week although doctors feel he should take two weeks off. He says he needs to get back to work to support his family.

He says doctors have told him he will eventually regain full use of his right arm.

Hendrix is being held on $40,000 bond.",1

"SONOMA, CA — Sonoma County sheriffs deputies working for the Sonoma Police Department arrested two people Sunday on suspicion of possessing items stolen from Safeway stores in Napa and Contra Costa counties. The allegedly stolen merchandise included baby food and over-the-counter medication that requires identification, police said. Deputies responded around 9:30 p.m. Sunday to a call about a theft in progress at the Safeway store at 477 W. Napa St. in Sonoma. The caller described the woman and a silver minivan involved in the theft. Another deputy pulled the minivan over on West Napa Street five blocks from the Safeway. A woman passenger in the van matched the witness description of the suspect, and the deputy saw several items of merchandise in the back of the van, Sonoma County sheriffs spokeswoman Misti Harris said. The witness identified the woman as the suspect who stole the merchandise. Deputies recovered more than 400 items valued at $9,500 they believe was stolen from the Safeway stores in Napa and Contra Costa counties, Harris said. The woman gave the deputies a false name at the scene, but deputies identified her as Ashley Chiane Easy, 23, of Antioch. Easy had an outstanding warrant in Napa County for a separate theft-related case, Harris said. Deputies also arrested the other occupant in the minivan, Julio Cesar Cuellar, 41, of San Francisco. The suspects were booked into Sonoma County Jail on suspicion of burglary, possession of stolen property and conspiracy, Harris said.

"New data from the FBI verifies that hate crimes have surged in the wake of Trumps election — but voters are now mobilized to punish Republicans for supporting racism and bigotry.

For the first time in a decade, hate crimes are up in two consecutive years in America. This rise coincides with the campaign and now presidency of Donald Trump, who has embraced bigotry like no other modern political figure.

But voters are already showing signs of resisting turning the clock back on hatred, and Republicans are suffering for their deal with the devil.

Newly released FBI crime statistics show an increase of nearly 5 percent in 2016, documenting 6,121 hate crime incidents – up from 5,850 in 2015.

58 percent of those hate crimes were motivated by racial bias, and more than half of the targets were black. Notably, groups singled out by Trump during his campaign experienced increased targeting.

Hate crimes against Latinos were up 15 percent, after Trump accused Mexicans of being rapists and pushed for an unworkable border wall. Hate crimes against Arabs were up 38 percent, as Trump has pushed for a ban on immigration against Muslims and countries with large Muslim populations.

The period right before Trump’s election saw an even stronger increased intensity in hate crimes. While the swing from 2015 to 2016 was in the single-digits for most of the year, the period between October and December of 2016 saw a 25.9 percent increase in hate-motivated attacks.

This major problem has resurfaced in the country right as the Republican Party, dying to grab power, has completely taken up the mantle of racism and hatred.

But fortunately, there are now tangible signs that Americans have had enough and are ready to fight back against the bile in a serious way.

In the Virginia gubernatorial election, Republican candidate Ed Gillespie embraced Trump’s pro-hatred stance, running ads scapegoating Latino immigrants for gang crime, while also praising monuments to pro-slavery Confederates.

But Gillespie was crushed by 9 percent by his Democratic rival, Ralph Northam. Northam’s victory was accompanied by Democratic candidates winning up and down the ticket, threatening the Republican grip on Virginia’s state government.

BlackPAC, which works to mobilize black voters, took polls in Virginia of minority voters after the racist riot that killed a woman in Charlottesville, Virginia. Trump’s response to the riot was to call the white supremacists “very fine people.”

BlackPAC found that a majority of those surveyed felt they were “under attack” from the Trump-backed racist movement, and wanted to send a message against racial hatred with their votes in Virginia.

Using that information, they designed a voter outreach program that activated anti-racist Virginia voters. The result? Turnout jumped to 57.4 percent in Charlottesville, the highest in a nonpresidential election there since 2000.

Bruce Smith, a black 62-year-0ld Navy veteran, told the Associated Press, “[Gillespie] was basically talking like Trump. So when I heard that, I realized, this guy right here is a supporter of Trump’s nasty ways and bigoted ways.” Smith voted for Democrats in the election.

The embrace of racism has backfired on Republicans in Virginia. Americans have seen hate crimes increase around them, and they are fighting back at the ballot box.

And the tide of pushing back has only just begun.",1

"WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal hate crime charges were filed Wednesday against a man accused of plowing a car into a crowd of people protesting a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing a woman and injuring dozens more.

The Department of Justice announced that an indictment returned Wednesday charges 21-year-old James Alex Fields Jr. of Maumee, Ohio, with 30 crimes, including one count of a hate crime resulting in the death of Heather Heyer, and 28 other hate crimes involving an attempt to kill other people who were injured.

“Last summer’s violence in Charlottesville cut short a promising young life and shocked the nation,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. “Today’s indictment should send a clear message to every would-be criminal in America that we aggressively prosecute violent crimes of hate that threaten the core principles of our nation.”

Authorities have said that Fields, described by a former teacher as having a keen interest in Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler, drove his speeding car into a group of people demonstrating against the “Unite the Right” rally that drew hundreds of white nationalists to the college town, where officials planned to remove a Confederate monument.

The attack came after the rally had descended into chaos — with violent brawling between attendees and counterdemonstrators — and authorities had forced the crowd to disband. Fields had been photographed hours beforehand with a shield bearing the emblem of Vanguard America, one of the hate groups that took part, although the group denied any association with him.

Fields already faces state charges including first-degree murder. He has been in custody since the rally.",1

"Joshua Brandon Vallum, 29, of Lucedale, Mississippi, was sentenced this week in the Southern District of Mississippi to 49 years in prison for assaulting and murdering Mercedes Williamson because she was a transgender woman.

The lengthy sentence “reflects the importance of holding individuals accountable when they commit violent acts against transgender individuals,” the U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement.

Vallum pleaded guilty last December to a single federal charge alleging he violated the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act in committing the murder two years ago this month in Mississippi.

In entering his guilty plea, the defendant, a member of the Latin Kings and Queens Nation gang, admitted that he had a consensual sexual relationship with Williamson, who was 17, and knew the victim was transgender. Vallum previously pleaded guilty to a state murder charge and was sentenced to life in prison.

During his romantic relationship with Williamson, Vallum kept the sexual nature of the relationship, as well as Williamson’s transgender status, secret from his family, friends and other members of his gang, investigators said.

After Vallum terminated the romantic and sexual relationship, he had no contact with her until May 28, 2015 when he decided to kill Williamson after learning that a friend had discovered Williamson was transgender, the defendant admitted during his guilty plea.

Federal investigators said Vallum believed he would be in danger if other Latin Kings members found out that he had engaged in a consensual sexual relationship with a transgender woman.

On May 29, 2015, Vallum located Williamson at her residence in Alabama and used false pretenses to lure her into his car so he could drive her to his father’s residence in Lucedale, Mississippi. There, Vallum admitted he used a stun gun to electrically shock the victim before repeatedly stabbing her and striking her with a hammer until she died.

After the murder, investigators learned, Vallum attempted to dispose of the murder weapons and other evidence linking him to the crime.

Vallum also falsely claimed to investigators that he killed Williamson in a panic after discovering she was transgender. In pleading guilty, Vallum acknowledged that he had lied about the circumstances surrounding the homicide and that he would not have killed Williamson if she was not transgender.

“Crimes motivated by hate have devastating effects on the victims, their families and community, but also leave a blemish on our society as a whole,” FBI Special Agent in charge Christopher Freeze said in a statement about the case.

The outcome of the case, Freeze said, “would not have been possible without the partnership between local, state and federal law enforcement.”",1
"TRENTON, NJ -- Seven people -- including a Red Bank couple -- have been charged with fraud related to Superstorm Sandy assistance, the state attorney generals office said Wednesday. James Avellini, 67, and Susan Horty-Avellini, 65, of Red Bank, are accused of getting $49,969 by filing false applications following Superstorm Sandy for FEMA assistance and state grants under the Homeowner Resettlement Program (RSP) and the Sandy Homeowner and Renter Assistance Program funded by the state Department of Human Services, according to a news release from the office of Acting Attorney General Robert Lougy. The charges released Wednesday bring the total to 57 people who have been charged with fraud as a result of investigations into applications for federal relief funds related to Sandy, Lougys office said. It is alleged the Avellinis falsely claimed in the applications that a storm-damaged property that they owned on Norman Court in Lavallette was their primary residence at the time Sandy hit. It is alleged that, in reality, the couples primary residence was in Red Bank, and the property in Lavallette was a seasonal home. The couple received a $24,992 FEMA grant, a $10,000 RSP grant, and $14,977 in SHRAP funding. Both defendants are charged with third-degree theft by deception and fourth-degree unsworn falsification.  Under each of these disaster relief programs, it was made absolutely clear that only those whose primary residences were damaged qualified for aid, but these defendants selfishly lied about their situation to divert funding intended for those left homeless when Sandy struck, Lougy said. Its a sad truth that even in the direst of emergencies, when so many generous people step forward to lend a hand, there are others who will dishonestly exploit an offer of assistance.  Others charged Wednesday by complaint-summons:      Through these joint investigations with our state and federal law enforcement partners, were working to ensure that limited disaster relief funds are allocated to the qualified victims who were hardest hit, Director Elie Honig of the Division of Criminal Justice said. Were also sending a deterrent message that we hope will reduce this criminal conduct in future emergencies, so relief administrators can focus on recovery efforts instead of policing fraud.  Sandy recovery remains central to DCAs mission, and a key part of that mission is helping our law enforcement partners root out people who are trying to game the system at the expense of storm victims who legitimately qualify for help, DCA Commissioner Charles A. Richman said. Because defrauders and scammers impede the States recovery efforts and pilfer taxpayer dollars, my Department doesnt hesitate to report suspicious applications when we see them.  Second-degree charges carry a sentence of five to 10 years in state prison and a fine of up to $150,000. Third-degree charges carry a sentence of three to five years in state prison and a fine of up to $15,000, while fourth-degree charges carry a sentence of up to 18 months in state prison and a fine of $10,000. The charges are merely accusations and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty.",0

"HOUSE DEMOCRATS IN NO HURRY TO REPLACE PELATH: When Speaker Michael K. Phillips was upset in the 1994 general election, John Gregg and his team secured the top Democratic leadership post before the sun rose the next morning. But on Tuesday at Organization Day just two days after Minority Leader Scott Pelath announced he would step down, no new leader emerged. It’s not even clear if a vote was taken (Howey Politics Indiana). State Rep. Earl Harris Jr., told HPI that the decision was delayed with next Monday the projected caucus date. Sources tell HPI that it appears none of the contenders - State Reps. Cherish Pryor, Ed DeLaney, Dan Forestal, Phil GiaQuinta, Terry Goodin and Chuck Moseley - could muster enough votes. “We gave them a speech today, our caucus, on how to be nice to one another, how to treat one another. It may not be our candidate but we’re in this together,” Minority Floor Leader Linda Lawson told Indiana Public Media. If there was any unanimity on Tuesday, it was Republican House Speaker Brian Bosma who praised Pelath. “In contrast to Washington D.C., we have focused on policy and not disagreement,” Bosma said. “Thanks to you for working together.” The chamber then gave Pelath a standing ovation.

PRESIDENT SIGNS DONNELLYS VETERAN OPIOID ABUSE BILL: Bipartisan legislation introduced in the Senate by U.S. Senators Joe Donnelly (D-IN) and Mike Rounds (R-SD), and in the House of Representatives by Congresswoman Annie Kuster (NH-2) and Congressman Brad Wenstrup (OH-2), was signed into law by President Trump, Donnellys office announced (Howey Politics Indiana). The VA Prescription Data Accountability Act will clarify current law to allow the VA to share data with state Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) for patients who are prescribed opioids by VA providers, including both veterans and their dependents.

LONG, BOSMA AGREE OPIOID CRISIS IS A TOP PRIORITY: Senate President David Long and House Speaker Brian Bosma both told their chambers on Organization Day that the opioid crisis poses severe challenges for the state and both anticipate working with Gov. Eric Holcomb (Howey Politics Indiana). “The opioid crisis is a huge issue for us. This is an unprecedented problem,” Long said. “We all have to be all in on this as a society. We need more treatment centers. We need more programs to spur recovery. We need to crack down on dealers, gangs and cartels who are pouring heroin over our borders. And, yes, we need more money to deal with the problem. This will be an issue that will be a burden on all of us and all of society for years to come. We must all do what we can do.” Bosma told his chamber, “We have a real opioid crisis and mental health crisis in this state right now. If we don’t have enough workers who can pass a drug test, we still have a big problem. Roughly 100 Hoosiers die each month, most from opioids.”

LAWMAKERS TO TARGET SCHOOL FUNDING GAP: The state needs to shuffle money during the upcoming legislative session to meet school funding needs it failed to foresee. Due to an unexpected increase in public school enrollment, lawmakers have to fill a more than $9 million gap (Lindsay, Indiana Public Media). Senate President Pro Tem David Long (R-Fort Wayne) says it’s a top priority once the session begins. “It’s not a bad problem – we have more kids going into to public schools than we did last year,” Long says. “But it’s a challenge for us only in the sense we need to adjust our numbers.” Lawmakers had previously estimated lower enrollment during last year’s budget session. But Long added that a number of factors could have contributed to the unexpected increase. “We don’t know if it’s coming from public school transfers with people coming from private schools, just from an unusual birth rate that year and more kids are coming into school this year than anticipated,” he says.

ATTORNEY GENERAL HILL SAYS CBD OIL ‘ILLEGAL’: Attorney General Curtis Hill declared that CBD oils are illegal in Indiana (Howey Politics Indiana). “Over recent weeks, I’ve worked with my staff to develop an advisory opinion regarding the status under Indiana law of the chemical compound cannabidiol – better known as ‘CBD.’ Cannabidiol is one of the most prevalent chemical compounds in the cannabis plant, otherwise known as marijuana. This issue has drawn public attention this year following law-enforcement actions against Indiana stores marketing and selling ‘CBD oil,’ a substance delivered to consumers in dropper bottles, sprays or mists – all generally to be taken orally. My task at this juncture is not to express my personal view of what I believe the law ought to stipulate. My task, rather, is to help provide clarity regarding what the law already says as written. There is no doubt, as a matter of legal interpretation, that products or substances marketed generally for human consumption or ingestion, and containing cannabidiol, remain unlawful in Indiana as well as under federal law. Indiana law does allow for a limited and focused exception created by House Enrolled Act 1148, signed earlier this year, aimed at individuals battling treatment-resistant epilepsy. This legislation pertains specifically to individuals properly added to the newly created Indiana State Department of Health Cannabidiol Registry.”

SENS. TOMES, DORIOT TO RESPOND WITH CBD LEGISLATION: State Sens. Jim Tomes and Blake Doriot responded to Attorney General Hill’s CBD ruling by saying they will file legislation to “clarify” the issue (Howey Politics Indiana). In a joint statment, Tomes and Doriot said, “Today, Attorney General Curtis Hill released an opinion stating the chemical compound cannabidiol, more commonly known as CBD oil, and the products or substances marketed for human consumption containing CBD oil remain unlawful. The only exception are those individuals who are battling epilepsy and are on the newly created Indiana State Department of Health Cannabidiol Registry. There is still a lot of misunderstanding regarding what CBD oil is, where it comes from and what it does. CBD oil does not create a “high,” but what it can do is help those who suffer from multiple seizures a day. There will be legislation introduced in the upcoming 2018 legislative session to clarify who can sell and buy CDB oil, in addition to expanding limitations to those with a treatment resistant medical condition.”

TRUMP THROWS ROY MOORE A LIFELINE: President Trump was asked about whether he was backing Republican Alabama Senate nominee Roy Moore, a man whom nine women, including one who was age 14 at the time, have accused of either sexual harassment or assault (Howey Politics Indiana). Trump responded, “If you look at what is really going on, and you look at all the things that have happened over the last 48 hours, he totally denies it. He says it didn’t happen. You have to listen to him also. I do have to say, 40 years is a long time. He has run eight races, and this has never come up. Trump is siding with an alleged pedophile over a “Democrat” because he needs the votes in the Senate to pass his tax reform plan. “We don’t need a liberal person in there, a Democrat Jones — Ive looked at his record,” Trump said. “Its terrible on crime. Its terrible on the border. Its terrible on the military.” White House counselor Kellyanne Conway adds, “I’m telling you that we want the votes in the Senate to get this tax bill through.” The media asked him about whether this was a “pivotal moment in sexual assault” on American women, with a PBS/NPR/Marist Poll showing that 35% have been sexually harassed in the workplace. President Trump responded, “Women are very special. I think it’s a very special time, a lot of things are coming out, and I think that’s good for our society and I think it’s very very good for women, and I’m very happy these things are coming out.”

‘WE DON’T BELIEVE THESE WOMEN’ SAYS MOORE CAMPAIGN: Spokespeople for Alabama Republican Senate nominee Roy Moore denied the allegations against the candidate at an event on Tuesday, refusing to answer questions as women come forward about Moores past (CNN). We believe Judge Moore, Moore campaign strategist Dean Young said. We dont believe these women. Its just that simple. And yall can keep trotting them out if you want to. Ben DuPré, who identified himself as a longtime Moore ally and billed the event as a news conference, said the former judge is above reproach. We dont believe a word of these lies, DuPré said of the allegations.

CBS, PBS FIRE CHARLIE ROSE: PBS said Tuesday it was parting ways with Charlie Rose and CBS announced it fired the 75-year-old broadcaster for “extremely disturbing and intolerable behavior” following an extensive Washington Post report that detailed his alleged unwanted sexual advances toward women (Washington Post). His firing was announced by CBS News President David Rhodes, who wrote in a midday memo to the network’s staff that it was “effective immediately.” “Despite Charlie’s important journalistic contribution to our news division, there is absolutely nothing more important, in this or any organization, than ensuring a safe, professional workplace — a supportive environment where people feel they can do their best work,” Rhodes wrote. “We need to be such a place.” PBS terminated its relationship with Rose and canceled distribution of his programs “in light of yesterday’s revelations,” spokeswoman Jennifer Rankin Byrne said in a statement.

PENCE VISITS COST COLUMBUS: Theres pride in being the hometown of the vice president. But theres also a cost. The Columbus police and fire departments are running out of budgeted overtime pay to cover visits by Vice President Pence (IndyStar). The city council will consider Tuesday an ordinance increasing the overtime budgetsfor the departments by a combined $70,000. Thats about an 18 percent increase in the $390,388 initially approved for overtime pay this year. The ordinance says the extra funding is needed because of unanticipated overtime events related to vice-presidential visits to our city. But Columbus Mayor James Lienhoop said only about half the extra cost is related to Pence visits. And, he added, the expense is well within our ability to manage. It’s a good problem to have, Lienhoop said. We’re proud of Mike and pleased to be able to participate in some small way to his service to our country.

HPI DAILY ANALYSIS: Americans have often looked to the White House for civic and moral clarity or reassurance. President Trump was asked about whether he was backing Republican Alabama Senate nominee Roy Moore, a man whom nine women, including one who was age 14 at the time, have accused of either sexual harassment or assault. Trump responded, “If you look at what is really going on, and you look at all the things that have happened over the last 48 hours, he totally denies it. He says it didn’t happen. So Trump is siding with an alleged pedophile. The media asked him about whether this was a “pivotal moment in sexual assault” on American women, President Trump responded, “Women are very special. I think it’s a very special time, a lot of things are coming out, and I think that’s good for our society and I think it’s very very good for women.” Meanwhile, the Moore campaign flatly states “We don’t believe these women.” So there you go. These will be the soundbites of 2018. If Republicans are wondering why female challengers are coming out in droves for the 2018 mid-terms, finding real traction earlier this month in their Virginia House of Delegate races, here’s your Exhibit A. - Brian A.

BRAUN VOWS TO SPEAK FOR CHANGE: Southern Indiana businessman Mike Braun said he is seeking the Republican Party nomination to oppose incumbent Democratic Senator Joe Donnelly in 2018 to bring change (de la Bastide, Anderson Herald-Bulletin). Braun, 53, the owner of a Jasper company, has served in the Indiana House since 2014 and has already signed a pledge to serve only two terms in the U.S. Senate. During a campaign stop in Anderson on Thursday, Braun met with about 40 people at a Madison County Tea Party meeting. Braun said he is running because career politicians are just as bad as the federal government when it comes to overregulation of small businesses.

DONNELLY TALKS OPIOIDS, NORTH KOREA IN KOKOMO: U.S. Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-IN), already well into his campaign for 2018 re-election, made his second stop in Kokomo in recent months Monday, speaking to a crowd of local officials and business leaders about topics ranging from synthetic drugs to the placement of North Korea on Americas terrorism blacklist (Myers, Kokomo Tribune).

GOP NAMES WIGMORE TO CROWN POINT COUNCIL: T.J. Wigmore was selected by Republican caucus Monday to fill an at-large Crown Point City Council seat left empty by the resignation this month of former Councilman Chris Retson (Napoleon, Post-Tribune).

ZODY SAYS STATE GOP AGENDA TINKER RATHER THAN REFORM: Indiana Democratic Party Chairman John Zody issued the following statement on Organization Day, according to a news item posted to the partys official website (Howey Politics Indiana): Indiana ranks in the bottom 10 nationally for educational attainment, an indicator of workforce preparedness. Its been that way for more than a decade. Wage growth is just as dismal. Its clear our current trajectory wont put Hoosiers on the fast-track toward bigger paychecks and better skills, yet Governor Holcomb and Statehouse Republicans appear intent to tinker rather than reform. Holcomb and Republicans might be comfortable with the status quo, but big problems call for bold solutions. More of the same wont cut it. Hoosiers wont wait another decade for higher wages and better skills. Session is rapidly approaching. Statehouse Democrats are already releasing policy details focused on lifting up hardworking Hoosiers. If Statehouse Republicans arent leading with big ideas, how exactly are they earning their taxpayer-funded salaries?

JONES AD TARGETS MOORE: Three weeks before the Alabama special election, Democratic Senate candidate Doug Jones is zeroing in on his opponent, Judge Roy Moore, and the numerous allegations of sexual assault against him in a new campaign ad (CBS News).

General Assembly

NUMBER OF GOALS IN MIND FOR 2018 SESSION, LONG SAYS: Members of the Indiana Senate met at the Statehouse for Organization Day — the ceremonial start of the Indiana General Assembly, Senate President Pro Tem David Long (R-Fort Wayne) announced in a news release distributed yesterday (Howey Politics Indiana). Organization Day is marked by the annual first roll call of all state lawmakers. This day also provides each Senate and House of Representatives caucus with the opportunity to organize before session officially reconvenes Jan. 3. My colleagues and I are approaching the upcoming session with a number of goals in mind, Long said. Workforce development continues to be a top priority as we look for ways to make sure Hoosiers are skilled and ready to fill the high-wage, high-demand jobs that are being created in our state. We will also continue to look for ways to fight the opioid epidemic and improve our education system for students and adults.

BOSMA SAYS WILL ADDRESS ISSUES HEAD-ON: House Speaker Brian C. Bosma (R-Indianapolis) emailed the following statement on Organization Day at the Statehouse (Howey Politics Indiana): Indianas economy is hitting on all cylinders, and employers continue to choose our state to locate and expand. But despite this success, many challenges lie ahead. In particular, we need to maintain our focus on strengthening Indianas workforce, tackle the ongoing opioid crisis that is devastating our state and others, continue to improve our childrens education, and further streamline government and reduce bureaucracy. We look forward to addressing these issues head-on during the legislative session with the help of our Senate colleagues and Gov. Eric Holcomb.

MERRITT ANNOUNCES 2018 MEDICAL INDUSTRY BILLS: State Sen. Jim Merritt (R-Indianapolis) announced in a news release bills he plans to author for the 2018 legislative session (Howey Politics Indiana). Some of the bills will call for mandatory registration in INSPECT by all Controlled Substance Registration-holders, mandatory lockable bottles for prescription drugs, making reports of the use of Naloxone accessible to providers, and implementation of prescription take-back programs statewide. We have determined multiple ways we can attack the drug epidemic within the medical industry, Merritt said. Were trying to make it easier for providers to know the patients prescription history and use of Naloxone. Doing this would assist providers in making an informed decision when prescribing opioids and harder for those prescriptions to get into the hands of those who are addicted.

SIKHS PAC BACKS HATE CRIME LEGISLATION: Gurinder Singh Khalsa, chairman of SikhsUSA and SikhsPAC, endorsed pending hate crimes legislation at a press conference held today at the Indiana Statehouse (Howey Politics Indiana). The event was organized by the Centeral Indiana Alliance Against Hate and included state legislators and representatives of various organizations. Khalsa emphasized the importance of enacting hate crimes legislation to Hoosiers and our state’s economic development. “Today, many businesses – including large corporations of all types – will not locate their operations in states that don’t protect threatened minorities,” Khalsa said. “Business want to be sure that they can employ the best people possible, without regard to race, sex, color or religion. And they want to be assured that their employees are protected from harm. Our state is dependent on businesses to create opportunities for everyone,” he added. “The lack of a strong hate crimes law deters companies from considering Indiana for new jobs. And it implies that we, as Hoosiers, do not cherish all of our fellow citizens.”

BLOOMINGTON LEGISLATORS TO WORK ON OPIOIDS: State Rep. Jeff Ellington, R-Bloomington, said more agencies are starting to focus on this issue, which affects the state’s workforce, families and more. He said a lot of different bodies are now getting on the same page in understanding the extent of the opioid epidemic, but there is still work to be done (Rollins, Bloomington Herald-Times). Statehouse Democrats also are focused on the issue. State Sen. Mark Stoops, D-Bloomington, said that while he agrees addressing the opioid epidemic is important, legislators must treat the situation as a public health crisis. He said addiction is a disease and it needs to be treated as such, not as a criminal issue by throwing addicts in prison. State Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, agreed, but also linked addressing the opioid issue with the need to ensure Hoosiers still have access to affordable health care. He said he would like to see the Legislature come up with a fail-safe if the Affordable Care Act is repealed at the federal level. A repeal of the federal health-care law could affect the states HIP 2.0 program, which provides some lower-income Hoosiers with health insurance — including, for some, the ability to get the opioid treatment they need.

HOUSE LAWMAKERS TO RAISE AWARENESS OF FOSTER HOME SHORTAGE: A news release from the office of House Speaker Brian C. Bosma (R-Indianapolis), with House Democratic Leader Scott Pelath (D-Michigan City), announced that the Indiana House of Representatives is partnering with the Indiana Association of Resources and Child Advocacy and its Institute for Excellence during the 2018 legislative session (Howey Politics Indiana). The nonprofit organization serves over 4,600 children in foster homes, group homes and treatment facilities, and works closely with the Indiana Department of Child Services to improve the lives of children. In Indiana, nearly twice as many children are in the foster care system than there are available foster homes, according to DCS, the news release stated. Bosma said more than half of these children have a parent with substance abuse issues – a growing problem due in part to the opioid epidemic. To help spread awareness and encourage more Hoosiers to consider fostering or adopting, legislators and IARCA launched a social media campaign using #FosterHopeIndiana and a new website, www.FosterHopeIndiana.org, with information for anyone looking for ways to help.

MELTON PLANS WORKSHOP ON LEGISLATIVE PROCESS: According to information provided to Howey Politics Indiana, Indiana State Senator Eddie Melton (D-Gary) will present a workshop Dec. 5 about the legislative process as well as how citizens can ensure their voices are heard in the General Assembly (Howey Politics Indiana). Speakers include State Senator Eddie Melton and Kate Bell, ACLU, partnering with Gary Branch of the NAACP and the Gary Teachers Union. Event is 5:30-7:30 p.m. at Gary Teachers Union, 1301 Virginia St., Gary, 46407.

John Conyers, D-Mich., was accused of sexual misconduct by a second woman earlier this year, as he faces a new ethics investigation after denying a separate report that alleges he sexually harassed a female aide, leading to a reported five-figure payout funded by taxpayers (Parkinson, ABC News). The committee is aware of public allegations that Representative John Conyers, Jr. may have engaged in sexual harassment of members of his staff, discriminated against certain staff on the basis of age, and used official resources for impermissible personal purposes, Reps. Susan Brooks, R-Ind., and Ted Deutch, D-Fla., the chair and ranking member of the House Ethics Committee, announced today. The committee ... has begun an investigation and will gather additional information regarding these allegations. Conyers is already under investigation by the ethics committee for a separate matter pertaining to his former chief of staff.

DONNELLY WELCOMES TRUMPS N. KOREA SANCTIONS: U.S. Senator Joe Donnelly (D-IN) released the following statement after the Trump Administration announced additional sanctions against North Korea and its backers (Howey Politics Indiana). According to a news release, the U.S. Department of Treasury said it sanctioned 13 entities, 20 shipping companies and vessels, and one individual in an effort to maximize economic pressure and level sanctions against those enabling the North Korean regimes funding of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Donnelly said, I have long called for stronger action to counter North Koreas growing nuclear arsenal, including additional sanctions. Those enabling North Koreas dangerous regime must be held accountable. I welcome todays announcement, and I hope the Senate will act soon to pass bipartisan legislation I helped craft that would further increase sanctions on North Korea and its backers.

NATIONAL GUARD, DONNELLY TO DISCUSS MENTAL HEALTH ASSESSMENTS: An email from the office of U.S. Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-IN) stated the senator and the Indiana National Guard will hold a press conference to discuss the impact of the Jacob Sexton Military Suicide Prevention Act on Monday (Howey Politics Indiana). The act seeks to prevent military suicide by requiring all servicemembers — Guard, Reserve, and Active Duty — to have an annual mental health assessment, according to the news release. Donnelly authored the Sexton Act, which is law and has been implemented this year throughout the Armed Forces, including the Indiana National Guard. The Sexton Act is named for Hoosier Jacob Sexton, a National Guardsman, who took his life in 2009. Joining Donnelly will be Major General Courtney Carr, Adjutant General of Indiana, and Major Scott Edwards, Chief Behavioral Sciences Officer of the Indiana National Guard. Event begins at 11 a.m; at 2002 S. Holt Road, Indianapolis 46241.

MESSER APPLAUDS DOE FOR RESTORING GRANTS TO ITT STUDENTS: U.S. Rep. Luke Messer (IN-06), in a news release posted online, applauded the Trump Administration and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos for retroactively restoring Pell Grant eligibility to the approximately 16,000 students nationwide who were using the grants to attend Indiana-based ITT Technical Institute when it abruptly closed last fall (Howey Politics Indiana). For many low-income students, Pell Grants are their best shot to attend college and secure a better future for themselves, Messer said. I appreciate Secretary Betsy DeVos and the Trump Administration for doing right by these students and ensuring they have a path forward to continue their education.

MURKOWSKI BACKS ACA MANDATE REPEAL IN TAX PLAN: Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said Tuesday that she supports repealing ObamaCares individual mandate, in what appeared to be a significant boost to the GOP tax bill that includes mandate repeal (Sullivan, The Hill). Murkowski, a key moderate swing vote, wrote in the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner that she supports giving people additional freedom by repealing the mandate, which requires people to have insurance or pay a fine.

CONYERS ADMITS SETTLEMENT: After initially denying that he has settled sexual with any current or former staff members, Rep. John Conyers Jr. admitted Tuesday that he had reached a monetary settlement with a former staff member (Connolly, Roll Call). But he said the case was resolved with an express denial of liability. I expressly and vehemently denied the allegations made against me, and continue to do so, the Michigan Democrat said in a statement, first reported by The Washington Post. My office resolved the allegations — with an express denial of liability — to save all involved from the rigors of protracted litigation. That should not be lost in the narrative, he said.

BANKS CALLS ON TOUGHER STANCE WITH HAMAS: A group of lawmakers on Monday called on Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to take a tougher stance on the terrorist group Hamas in Qatar (The Hill). In a letter addressed to Mnuchin, 19 members of Congress from both parties expressed concern that a joint statement earlier this year from Mnuchin and Qatari officials about cracking down on terrorist financiers did not address Hamas. “As state sponsors of terror such as Iran renew their financial support for Hamas, it is critical that the United States isolate and counter Hamas by cutting the terrorist organization at its source,” the lawmakers wrote. Among the lawmakers who signed the letter were Reps. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.), Jim Banks (R-Ind.), Ted Budd (R-N.C.), Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), Chuck Fleischmann (R-Tenn.) and Louie Gohmert (R-Texas).

Brady has not been charged with a crime.

PELOSI CALLS FOR CONYERS PROBE: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called for a formal ethics investigation into Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) following allegations he sexually harassed female staff and reached a settlement with an aide who claimed she was fired for rejecting his advances (Washington Post). “As Members of Congress, we each have a responsibility to uphold the integrity of the House of Representatives and to ensure a climate of dignity and respect, with zero tolerance for harassment, discrimination, bullying or abuse,” Pelosi said in a statement Tuesday. “As I have said before, any credible allegation of sexual harassment must be investigated by the Ethics Committee,” she said.

GOVERNOR: PARDONS SIX EX-OFFENDERS - Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb this week issued six pardons for ex-offenders (Daudelin, WFYI). The governor, with recommendations from a state board, considered 21 applications from ex-offenders looking for a pardon – which strikes felony charges from their record. The six men chosen were convicted of crimes like theft, attempted fraud, and battery. But they have since become pastors, barbers and motivational speakers. All six served their sentences more than ten years ago. Holcomb spokesperson Stephanie Wilson says the criteria for receiving a pardon is rigorous. These people have to demonstrate not only that theyve been crime-free for in some cases 30 or more years, but that theyve dedicated their life, in some way, to improving their community, Wilson says.

GOVERNOR: CROUCH PROMOTES EFFORT TO BRING ART TO INDYS MLK PARK - Martin Luther King Jr. Park in Indianapolis will soon have two new public art pieces to honor King and Robert Kennedy thanks to a new crowdfunding campaign (Indianapolis Recorder).

Dr. Kings impact on our country was unprecedented, said Lt. Gov. Suzanne Crouch, chair of IHCDA. His efforts to promote peace and nonviolence left a lasting impact on our state and nation. We couldnt be more honored to join KKMI to recognize, on the day of his unfortunate assassination, King and the historic speech delivered by Kennedy here in Indianapolis.

STATEHOUSE: AGENCIES PREP FOR SELF-DRIVING CARS - State agencies are working with private firms and Purdue University to prepare Indiana roads and licensing requirements for self-driving vehicles (Miley, CNHI). The agreements come as the Indiana General Assembly will likely be presented with a plan to form a task force evaluating the changes needed to bring, first, connected vehicles and, later, autonomous technology to Hoosier roads. Connected vehicles are able to pinpoint locations of other vehicles on the road, while autonomous vehicles can monitor the road and drive for an entire trip without the intervention of a human. The proposal would echo Gov. Eric Holcombs support for the development of autonomous vehicles he noted in laying out his agenda for 2018.

EDUCATION: PURDUE LAUNCHES AFFORDABILITY GRANT - Purdue University has launched a grant program to help lower- and middle-class students in Indiana afford college (Colombo, IBJ).

The program will start next fall and is for Indiana resident students at Purdues West Lafayette campus. The students will need to be eligible for the Federal Pell Grant, or have a parent adjusted gross income of $70,000 or less. Eligibility for the Pell Grant is determined based on a familys financial need and the cost of attendance at a particular school.

WHITE HOUSE: TRUMP, PUTIN DISCUSS SYRIA - President Donald Trump spoke for more than an hour Tuesday by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin (CBS News). Syria, Iran, North Korea and Ukraine were on the agenda, the White House said. Trumps phone call with the Russian president came a day after Putin met with Syrian President Bashar Assad. Putin hosted Assad at a Black Sea resort ahead of a summit later this week with Russia, Turkey and Iran. Assad was called to Russia to get him to agree to potential peace initiatives drafted by Russia, Iran and Turkey, the Kremlin said.

As he prepared to depart the White House, the president said in response to a shouted question from a reporter that he shouldn’t comment on the litigation. Then he added: “Personally, I’ve always felt that that was a deal that’s not good for the country. I think your pricing is going to go up.”

In addition to the names, emails and phone numbers of millions of riders, about 600,000 drivers’ license numbers were accessed, Uber said. Uber said financial information such as credit cards and Social Security numbers weren’t taken. Uber said it identified the hackers and “obtained assurances” they had destroyed the stolen data.

MEDIA: ‘CHARLIE DOESN’T GET A PASS HERE’ - There was a proverbial empty chair on the set of CBS This Morning on Tuesday as Norah ODonnell and Gayle King covered the suspension of their co-host and friend Charlie Rose (CNN). This is a moment that demands a frank and honest assessment, ODonnell said. Thats exactly what ODonnell and King delivered. They talked in detail about the sexual misconduct allegations against Rose, a television news icon who has co-hosted the morning show since 2012. Charlie does not get a pass here, King said.

SPORTS: NFL MAY KEEP PLAYERS IN LOCKEROOM DURING ANTHEM - Some NFL owners believe there is a strong possibility they will enact an offseason change to the league’s national anthem policy if the players’ protests during the anthem persist through the end of this season, reverting to a previous approach of keeping players in the locker room while the anthem is played, according to several people familiar with the league’s inner workings (Washington Post). “I think that if players are still kneeling at the end of the year, then it could very well happen,” said one person familiar with the owners’ deliberations on anthem-related issues.

ZIMBABWE’S MUGABE RESIGNS: President Robert Mugabe stepped down Tuesday after ruling this Southern African country for 37 years, during which he went from toppling white-minority rule to overseeing a series of punishing economic crises and escalating political repression (Wall Street Journal).

Ratko Mladic of genocide and crimes against humanity and sentenced him to life in prison for atrocities perpetrated during Bosnias 1992-1995 war (Associated Press). The court in The Hague convicted Mladic of 10 of 11 counts in a dramatic climax to a groundbreaking effort to seek justice for the wars in the former Yugoslavia. Presiding Judge Alphons Orie read out the judgment Wednesday after ordering Mladic out of the courtroom over an angry outburst. Mladic was found guilty of commanding forces responsible for crimes including the worst atrocities of the war — the deadly three-year siege of the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, and the 1995 massacre of some 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the eastern enclave of Srebrenica.

CITIES: INDY REPUBLICANS UNHAPPY WITH MILLER - Indianapolis City-County Councilman Jeff Miller, who was charged with three counts of child molesting Friday, is drawing frustration from his fellow council Republicans by not resigning from his seat (Colombo, IBJ). Marion County GOP chairman Jim Merritt said Tuesday in a written statement that Miller indicated he would resign from the council on Friday, but he had yet to do so by Tuesday afternoon. Jeff Miller directly informed me on Friday that he intended to resign from his position on the Indianapolis City-County Council and I expect him to do the right thing and resign immediately, Merritt said in the statement. Jeff Miller has been investigated and charged with deplorable acts that should immediately disqualify anyone from public office. The Republican caucus of the council also released a statement urging him to resign, and Indiana Republican Party Chairman Kyle Hupfer did so as well.

CITIES: ERROR COULD COST SCHOOLS $9 MILLION - Schools could see a $9 million cut in funding statewide because lawmakers missed the enrollment projection in the current budget cycle (Kelly, Fort Wayne Journal Gazette). An Indiana Department of Education memo going out Friday to schools said the tuition support appropriation of $7.041 billion is not enough to cover the costs, and future payments to schools could see a reduction if legislators dont shift money in the next session... The error is because 6,000 more students enrolled in public school than expected. Senate President Pro Tem David Long (R-Fort Wayne) says its a top priority once the session begins (Lindsay, WFYI). Its not a bad problem – we have more kids going into to public schools than we did last year, Long says. But its a challenge for us only in the sense we need to adjust our numbers.

Associated Press - INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - An Indiana Senate committee is set to vote on a legislation targeting hate crimes.

Bills targeting hate crimes have failed in recent years and the state is one of just five without laws against crimes motivated by biases, such as race, gender, religion and sexual orientation.

But proponents say they are optimistic this year. Both House Speaker Brian Bosma and Senate leader David Long say they support the idea. Thats a change from the past.

Opponents, including social conservatives, say hate crime laws create special protected classed that treat victims of similar crimes differently.

But supporters say the lack of such a law makes Indiana look backward.

The Senate Corrections and Criminal Law committee will take up the legislation Tuesday morning.",1

(Orange County, CA)— The 2016 Orange County Hate Crime Report, published by the Orange County Human Relations Commission, shows “hate crimes” increased in 2016. The most frequently targeted were African Americans, the LGBT community, and Latinos. They make up the top three groups. However, the most dramatic increase was seen in the number of hate incidents, which in 2016 totaled 72 compared to the 43 reported in 2015. The 2016 reported hate incidents primarily targeted the Muslim community. “When there is hatred, it needs to be called out as such and responded to with a loud voice that is unequivocal. That is what our Commission does and should continue doing,” expressed OC Human Relations Commission Chair, Rabbi Rick Steinberg.

The 26th annual OC Human Relations Commission Hate Crime Report is based on the Commission’s collaboration with Orange County law enforcement agencies, local schools and community organizations. The focus of the report is on bias-related crime, or “Hate Crime” defined as a criminal act committed based on the victim’s real or perceived disability, gender, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation or association with a person or group with one or more of these identities. Under California law there are enhanced penalties for hate crimes. Perpetrators of “Hate Incidents” have the same motivation, but their hate speech and writings are not crimes, they are protected speech. Our process in reporting and tracking hate crime is consistent with the Attorney General of California, the FBI and most other Human Relations Commissions across California.

The increase of hate crimes documented in 2016 does not negate a downward trend of these crimes seen over the past decade. Nevertheless, the Commission continues to be concerned about every hate crime and also believes there is significant underreporting. While it is unknown how many hate crimes are not reported, the Commission encourages those who work in communities and neighborhoods (law enforcement, places of worship, schools, and community organizations) to report these crimes.

"CHICAGO, IL - A University of Chicago police officer shot a suspect in Hyde Park late Tuesday night. The man who was shot was wielding a large metal pole and shattering the windows of cars and apartments before the altercation that unfolded around 10:13 p.m. in the 5300 block of South Kimbark Avenue. Multiple reports indicate the man who was shot is a student at the University of Chicago who was having a manic episode when the incident unfolded. Police first arrived on the scene to a call of a burglary in process in the alley between Kimbark and South Woodlawn Avenue near 53rd Street, according to a statement from the university. The suspect, confirmed by the university to be a student, was holding a long metal pipe while breaking car and apartment windows when police arrived. The individual ignored the officers repeated requests to drop the pipe, and at one point charged an officer with the weapon, the schools statement read, in part. At that time, the officer discharged his weapon, striking the individual in the shoulder. The man, whose age wasnt immediately available, was shot in the shoulder and taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital in serious condition, Chicago police said. He was later improved and listed in stable condition late Wednesday night. Some video of the incident that led to the shooting has been shared by University of Chicago police. ABC-7 shared a few of them here. Residents heard the sound of smashing glass a little after 10 p.m. and several neighbors immediately called police, according to the report. The statement from the school indicates the Chicago Police Department will investigate the incident while the officer involved will be placed on mandatory administrative leave. This is a difficult incident for our community, and our concern is with all of the individuals involved and their families., the schools statement continued. Student groups formed Wednesday to call for more transparency from the campus police department, the Hyde Park Herald reported. Campus police directed all questions to the University of Chicago public relations, which did not respond. Image via Shutterstock",0
"David Carroll Peeples Sr., 76, of Dunedin is missing. A silver alert has been issued. He was last seen at his home on Honeymoon Island around 11:30 p.m. Sunday. Peeples and his vehicle, 2005 white Toyota Prius, were not at his home as expected Monday morning, the Pinellas County Sheriffs Office reports. Peeples is a white male.

"I first heard it as a young boy when my brother and I accompanied our parents on civil rights marches in the 1960s. Though most of the marchers were black, there were a number of whites marching with us, which was somewhat confusing at first.

Werent the injustices we were marching against put up by whites?

But there it was — that lyric in the song We Shall Overcome:

Black and white together.

Over time, the presence of whites offered some clarity that not all whites were against us, and some comfort that we were not in this fight alone.

In the aftermath of the arrest of James Alex Fields Jr., for allegedly driving his car at counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Va., and killing Heather Heyer while injuring many others, there was an interesting exchange on one of the cable news networks as to whether Fields would be charged with a hate crime.

The sticking point was that Fields, the perpetrator, and Heyer, the victim, were both white, and she may not have been the intended target.

In the initial coverage of the incident, I saw only whites. Later images showed a black man frozen by camera in mid-air, and a black woman being transported on a gurney.

Was he targeting the blacks and hit Heyer and other whites as collateral damage?

I pondered this notion that a neo-Nazi, Ku Klux Klanner, alt-righter or otherwise hateful person of one race could kill someone of the same race for supporting someone different from both of them — and not have it be a hate crime because the victim and perpetrator were of the same race.

My thoughts took me back to Rev. Rims Barber, a white man I met in Jackson, Miss., two Septembers ago while interviewing people across the state about their experience with the n-word for my film documentary Journey to the Bottom of the n-Word.

Barber, who was 78 when I interviewed him, left Iowa for Mississippi to join the Freedom Summer movement in 1964. He returned in 1965. He recalled that it was during one of those years in Canton, Miss., that he faced the wrath of a white mob alongside blacks and other whites while picketing or trying to register blacks to vote.

He described one instance where they were trying to desegregate a movie theater only to be met by a mob of whites who chased them back to the black community yelling the n-word and hitting them with sticks every step of the way.

I was called a nigger lover. Or a white nigger, he said.

Were you hit? I asked.

Yeah.

For those who ask why he would put his own life and safety on the line for those who were unlike him in skin color, he offered this: Justice is indivisible. Theres no way to create justice for one group without doing it for everybody.

This is not to place the life and safety of white participants on a pedestal above the life and safety of blacks who face challenges day in and day out with no respite due to the color of their skin.

But it is to say when whites join blacks for a common cause for justice, liberty and equality, they become, in the eyes of the haters, white blacks, or traitors to their race — as it was when white John Brown led a revolt to free the slaves at Harpers Ferry; as it was when white Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner came to Mississippi and died with black James Chaney during Freedom Summer; as it was when white Heather Heyer joined the counter-protesters to oppose neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klanners alt-righters and just plain hateful people in Charlottesville.

I dont know if Fields was aiming at the blacks he saw. I do know that history tells us that haters dont like black and white together. And when they are together, they are considered one and the same.

As they should be.

Heather Heyers death was a hate crime.

Local law enforcement across the board should be committed to investigating, reporting hate crimes, CSUSB professor says

ProPublica

Dec. 4, 2017

Under a federal law passed in 1990, the FBI is required to track and tabulate crimes in which there was “manifest evidence of prejudice” against a host of protected groups, including homosexuals, regardless of differences in how state laws define who’s protected. The FBI, in turn, relies on local law enforcement agencies to collect and submit this data, but can’t compel them to do so.

The evidence suggests that many police agencies across the country are not working very hard to count hate crimes. Thousands of them opt not to participate in the FBI’s hate crime program at all. Among the 15,000 that do, some 88 percent reported they had no hate crimes; federal records indicate that the Huntsville Police Department has never reported a hate crime.

According to Brian Levin, a former New York City police officer who studies hate crimes, some law enforcement agencies lack a commitment from the top to properly investigate such incidents and collect data on them.

“You have to have a combination of training, executive leadership, and some kind of infrastructure that is sustained and continuing,” Levin said.

"Over the weekend, Muskegon Heights police officers were called to the scene of a robbery.

When officers arrived on the scene, they found a 17-year-old victim who was lured to the area. He had been stripped of his clothes and possessions.

Police say the suspect beat the victim and took his clothes.

This young man was targeted based on his sexual orientation, said D.J. Hilson the Muskegon County Prosecutor.

The victim was released from a Muskegon hospital after receiving treatment for cuts and bruises--many of which were to his face.

This type of behavior should not and will not be tolerated in this community, said Chief Joseph Thomas Jr. of the Muskegon Heights Police.

The suspect, 18-year-old Trevon Godbolt, also know as Trevon Taylor, is facing the unarmed robbery and unlawful imprisonment charges from the Muskegon County Prosecutors Office. Both carry a maximum sentence of 15 years.

Police arrested Godbolt on Tuesday night, Nov. 7, according to Muskegon County prosecutor D.J. Hilson. He was arrested at a residence on Blue Lake Road by Michigan State Police, following a tip made to Silent Observer.

WZZM has video of the assault, which was also posted on social media. We decided not to publish the full version of the video due to the graphic and violent nature of the situation. In its full extent, the video lasts two minutes.

In the video, the assailant can be seen grabbing and beating the victim who yells, please stop.

The suspect repeatedly calls the victim a gay n-word and verbally berates him. The victim is forced to strip all of his clothes off.

Take the shirt off too, the suspect said. Im not playing with you...take everything off before you leave--even your drawers.

The suspect then tells the victim to run off, and he is chased by two women, one of whom is filming the assault. She laughs and yells, catch him.

Was this a hate crime?

In Michigan, there is no charge for assault based on sexual orientation.

A Senate bill was introduced earlier this year that would incorporate sexual orientation into the states ethnic intimidation charge. But it never made it out of committee.

The current law states:

A person is guilty of ethnic intimidation if that person maliciously, and with specific intent to intimidate or harass another person because of that persons race, color, religion, gender, or national origin.

I would hope that our legislature would use this as an example as to why we need to expand the law and include groups such as this to protect them, said Hilson.

Police Chief Thomas sent a report on the assault to an FBI investigator.

He said Chief send it to me, I will take it to the U.S. District Attorney and I will see if we cant get a Federal indictment for a hate crime said Thomas.

Serena Johnson the Director of Victim Services at Equality Michigan. Their statement read:

We are deeply saddened by these actions, and we send our thoughts and prayers to the survivor and his family. At a time when we are seeing the highest number reports of anti-gay youth violence, homicides of transgender and gender non-conforming people, this violence is totally unacceptable. We need to protect these lives at all stages, but especially in youth where they experience bullying, family rejection and violence that affects them throughout their lives.”

"Law enforcement agencies officially cleared WellStar Kennestone Hospital just after 2 p.m. Wednesday after a bomb threat that was called in to the facility Wednesday morning. Police received a 911 call at 10:02 a.m. reporting a destructive device had been planted somewhere at the hospital, Marietta police spokeswoman Brittany Wallace told Patch. Officers from Marietta PD, Cobb PD, Cobb County Sheriffs Office, KSU PD, and Kennestones own security patrol have been brought to the scene to sweep the hospital.

"The General Assembly passes legislation aimed at strengthening hate crime laws after a post-presidental-campaign spike in bias incidents.



Listen to Daisy Contreras interview Maureen Foertsch McKinney.

Not long after midnight on February 3, a man smashed the glass entrance of the Chicago Loop Synagogue and placed two swastika stickers on its door. Surveillance cameras caught the incident. Three days later, Stuart A. Wright, a Chicago man, now 32, was arrested and charged with a hate crime and felony damage to property. Wright, a CPA who grew up in the Chicago suburbs, pleaded not guilty. The next court date is later this month. The case has yet to go to trial.

That same week the synagogue was vandalized, residents of several south suburban and central Illinois communities discovered Ku Klux Klan recruitment fliers. Some were loose, some turned up on porches and others were in bundles at the end of driveways. And in early February, someone carved a swastika into a bench in a youth exhibit at the Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center in Skokie.

That event was one of dozens of instances of hate incidents in Illinois tracked by the Southern Poverty Law Center in the wake of the November presidential election. The spike in incidents was so great for the first few months after the election, says the SPLC’s outreach director Lecia Brooks, the organization starting tracking them along with continuing to keep tabs on the hate groups operating in the nation. The organization found 1,372 bias incidents between the election and February 7. In Illinois, the group came up with a tally of 56 incidents between the election and the end of March.

“Post-election, it really seemed to echo the rhetoric that began during the campaign—if you recall, that it started with the anti-immigrant and anti-Mexican rhetoric, with the whole build-the-wall (argument) that was the initial thing that Trump came up with when he launched his campaign. And then he moved to the Muslim ban, so it wasn’t surprising at all that we saw that the primary motivation for the majority of the bias incidents that happened across the country, the number one motivation was anti-immigrant animus,” says Brooks, who notes that in recent weeks the pace of the incidents has dwindled.

The instances of hate crimes and bias-related incidents caught the attention of officials and lawmakers in Illinois. Gov. Bruce Rauner and Attorney General Lisa Madigan each pushed a separate piece of hate crime legislation. Both sailed through the General Assembly.

Rauner in March announced a multi-pronged response that included increased police training, and Madigan conducted a hate crime summit in February at which representatives of several religious and ethnic groups reported having experienced that spike in hate incidents.

The attorney general told Illinois Issues, “There are more people that unfortunately feel more comfortable in committing hate crimes and hate speech. And so again, we have to make sure, as law enforcement, as society — we are responsive to the fact that hate crimes are something that is not just an attack on an individual, but it is an attack that is motivated with the goal of attacking a religion, somebody’s race, somebody’s way of life. And it is intended to have a broader impact as opposed to just harming an individual; it needs to harm a community. And this is why hate crimes laws were passed in the first place. But unfortunately, we’re seeing the circumstances in the United States right now, where we need to be more proactive and engaged and responsive as law enforcement to make sure that this doesn’t continue.”

The instances of hate crimes and bias incidents are wide-ranging. Take for example:

Four attackers in Chicago in January streamed on Facebook Live a multi-hour attack of a disabled teen they had kidnapped. They tied him up, beat and cut him and forced him to drink water from a toilet. While this occurred, they shouted racial slurs and obscenities about white people and the soon-to-be inaugurated Donald Trump.

But as the Daily Southtown newspaper reported after analyzing Chicago Public Department data, hate crimes against Jews, Muslims, Arabs and Hispanics hit five-year highs in 2016.

Since the election, attackers defaced a copy of the Quran at a suburban library, forced removal of Muslim women’s head scarves and put up racist, homophobic and anti-Semitic posters on college campuses.

Out of those concerns, Madigan orchestrated the forging of House Bill 3711, which would add cyberstalking, stalking and intimidation to the offenses considered to be a hate crime.

“There is a significant increase in the use of technology, as anybody who spends any amount of time on the internet, on social media, can tell you. So, we made sure to include cyberstalking, and certain acts of intimidation that deal with increased use of technology to commit hate crimes,” says Madigan.

The bill also gives her office authority to file civil complaints, and it allows “judges to impose a civil penalty of up to $25,000. I would hope it would serve as a significant deterrent from committing these crimes in the first place.”

Among the opponents to the bill was Rep. John Cavaletto, a Salem Republican, who says he is opposed to the concept of an act specifically being singled out as a hate crime and elevated to its own status.

Lonnie Nasatir, director of the Chicago/Upper Midwest Region of the Anti-Defamation League, strongly disagrees.

“All crimes obviously are bad. If somebody gets beaten up in a battery that is a bad situation. But it’s even more nefarious when someone is actually beaten up because of a protected category or an inherent characteristic of that particular victim whether it be ethnicity, race, sexual orientation, etc. because it’s really coming from a place of pure hate.”

Rauner’s representatives did not respond when asked whether he was expected to sign this measure.

In March, the governor gave a speech at the Illinois Holocaust Museum to announce a series of initiatives such as the development of a statewide, standardized training plan for local and state police. The program will be operated by the Illinois State Police and Anti-Defamation League and the Illinois Law Enforcement Training Board. Rauner also called for expanding anti-hate crime education in schools through a dedicated portal.

In the statement in March, Rauner also said he would order Department of Human Rights Director Janice Glenn to make a department policy to “ensure any complaints filed with DHR that rise to the level of a hate crime are referred to local law enforcement for potential criminal prosecution.”

Some have complained that Rauner appears to be giving particular attention to anti-Semitic hate crime, while putting less focus on other types.

Hoda Katebi, communications coordinator for the Chicago branch of the Council on American- Islamic Relations, says, “It’s difficult to see a governor only talking about one sort of hate crime and not talking about, for example, the increase of killings of black people in the hands of police. Or the deportations, ICE (U.S. Immigration and [Customs] ) raids and things like that — or also violence against Muslims. So, it’s not just the fact that Muslims are excluded from a topic of the governor’s conversation, but also everyone else who’s been suffering through a lot of forms of state violence or state oppression and go unnoticed all the time.”

A Rauner spokeswoman wrote in an email: “The Governors directives have and continue to address all forms of hate and intolerance. According to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), Illinois — like the nation — has seen a spike in anti-Semitic activity. We witnessed the vandalism at Chicagos Loop Synagogue, a bomb threat targeting Chicago Jewish Day School and a window shot out at a synagogue in neighboring Indiana. We must act against anti-Semitism and all forms of hate and bigotry.”

Nasatir says his sense is that “the governor, while he is concerned about anti-Semitism, he’s much more global and concerned about overall spike in hate crimes. I’ve spoken to his office several times. That’s why we’re working closely with Illinois state police and other law enforcement entities within the state system, to … go over their hate crime trainings and make sure it’s robust and that they’re really doing the best they can in terms of training their staff on what constitutes a hate crime and what doesn’t. And most important, the impact that these crimes have on all different types of communities and the importance of making sure that the law enforcement community understands this particular crime is different than your average crime and they must be there for communities.

In addition to the hate crime platform the governor introduced in March, he is supporting legislation that would strengthen hate crime law. Rauner says he will sign House Bill 2390, which was sponsored by Oswego Democratic Rep. Stephanie Kifowit. Kifowit says the idea for the legislation was brought to her by Sadia Covert, a representative of the Islamic Center of Naperville.

Covert, a Naperville attorney, says, “We noticed that although Illinois has a good hate crime law, I felt like that language could have been improved and tightened up a little bit more so it would be easier for police officers and other law enforcement officials and prosecutors to understand … I have received feedback from them, regarding the hate crime statute as it stands right now, that it’s not very clear, it’s a little vague — so it can be confusing.”

Madigan says she supports the bill. “I think both of these bills are a move that needed to be made, unfortunately because of the circumstances that we find ourselves in in this country.

The bill gives courts the discretion to determine if fines should be higher than the $1,000 set in current law, she says. “It would also allow for a court to assess actual damages and punitive damages — instead of just one or the other.”

Covert notes the bill also requires people who commit hate crimes to get training. “The thing about hate is that people are not born hateful. It is something that is developed over time, and it derives out of ignorance or a lack of knowledge.”

Along with legislative support, Madigan has asked Rauner to restore the state’s Hate Crime Commission, which was created by executive order in 1999, but has not been filled in a decade.

Rauner’s spokeswoman did not reply when asked whether he supported Madigan’s call.

“I know that there have not been appointments made for many years, but the intent behind it was a good one. It was really a state mechanism to contend with hate crimes and to do prevention work through both education and training. And so, again, this is a time when that is of most importance. So, it would be my hope that the governor would in fact appoint people to that commission and make sure that we’re using a very — it’s kind of a very easy mechanism, but a very important one to bring all of the advocates, all of the interested parties around the state together, who are already doing some of this work, certainly have the expertise, certainly have the desire to do it — to the table to make sure that we have the right resources, and the best resources directed to this problem.”

According to the Windy City Times, the city’s LGBT newspaper, Chicago Ald. Pat Dowell, chair of the Committee on Human Relations, and colleagues introduced a resolution last week to urge Rauner to restore the hate crime commission.

LGBT people have long been targets of hate and violence, says Mike Ziri, policy director of Equality Illinois, an advocacy group. “I want to say that violence has been a present condition in the lives of many LGBTQ people for years now. We know that in 2015, one-fifth of the hate crimes reported to the FBI were because of the victims’ sexual orientation or gender identity — 20 percent of all the hate crimes in 2015 reported. And we know from CPD that there was a 20 percent increase in hate crimes between 2015 and 2016, and we know that the majority of hate crimes in Chicago between 2012 and 2015 were attacks on black and gay men. So, there’s now a lot of focus since the election on hate crimes across the country, as there should be, but the violence in LGBTQ people’s lives has been a very present condition for as long as we’ve been coming out and being ourselves.”

As of mid-May, 11 transgender people had been murdered in the United States in 2016, including a 24-year-old black Chicago woman, Tiara Richmond (AKA Keke Collier), according to the National Center for Transgender Equality. Nine of them were women of color and seven of them were black. There were 25 transgender people reported murdered last year, according to the center.

Ziri says, “Sometimes folks fear and hate what they don’t understand and who they don’t know.”

"MIAMI - Is placing the hangmans noose at someones desk a hate crime? An investigation of City of Miami Department of Fire-Rescue firefighters continued to look for answers about a Sept. 9 incident that upset an African-American colleague.

Lt. Robert Webster reported finding the hangmans noose -- a symbol of racial terror that has been historically used to threaten African-Americans with hanging. Someone placed it over one of his family photos inside his office at Miami Fire Station No. 12.

Websters complaint prompted Chief Joseph Zahralban to ask the Miami Police Department to investigate the incident. Detectives determined Capt. William W. Bryson, Lt. Alejandro Sese, David Rivera, Harold Santana, Justin Rumbaugh and Kevin Meizoso were directly involved.

They had yet to identify the firefighters responsible for leaving the symbol of racial animus inside Websters office. After Zahralban decided to terminate the six firefighters, detectives were still investigating the incident Saturday. This raised questions about the potential for hate crime charges.

The Miami-Dade State Attorneys Office was set to review the case pending the results of the investigation.

Earlier this year, Pompano Beach Fire Chief John Jurgle faced a similar challenge when Vilbert Green, a black recruit found a noose hanging over his seat. The investigation began July 16.

Matthew Reilly, a recruit, was fired and three other recruits -- Kerop Berberian, Geandy Perez and Austin Sovay -- resigned. An investigation revealed Perez had tied the noose, but authorities couldnt determine who placed it on Greens seat. No one was charged.

The majority of hate crimes involve violent crimes, but violence is not a requirement to file hate crime charges. In March, someone left a noose outside of the Gotha Middle School in Orlando. Orange County Sheriffs Office deputies investigated the incident but no charges were ever filed.

A noose incident at the United States Mint in Philadelphia, a facility that manufactures coins, also in July prompted the Treasury Department to issue a statement about their absolute zero tolerance of the hateful display that for some brings flashbacks about the thousands of African-Americans who were hanged from trees during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The New York Police Departments hate crime task force was investigating a noose that was found hanging inside the mens locker room at the Metropolitan Opera House in Manhattan in October.

The Southern Poverty Law Center reported the frequency of noose hate crime incidents surged after the 2016 presidential election through March 31. Their list of incidents included nooses left at the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the American University campus in Washington, D.C., Crofton Middle School in Maryland and Wakefield High School in North Carolina.

The Anti-Defamation League acknowledged there was a surge in reports of noose episodes earlier this year, but the U.S. Department of Justice doesnt keep data on this type of reports.

Webster, who has served for the City of Miami Department of Fire-Rescue for about 17 years, said he believed the incident during the busy days of Hurricane Irma was stupid and a threat to the firefighters brotherhood. They had also drawn sexually explicit symbols on his family photos.

Zahralban decided to clean house. During a press conference, he said he remembers driving to Miami Fire Station No. 12 about 2:30 a.m. to see for himself what Webster had found on his desk. He said he was disgusted and got all personnel out of the station.

Webster said he has felt his support. The station in the neighborhood he grew up in was dedicated to Willie Waters, the first African-American firefighter hired within a major department in the state.

Racism and the tools of hatred (are) like a loaded gun sitting on the table, Webster said.

"The government is spending hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers’ cash on the first-ever national police unit dedicated to tackling internet ‘trolls’.

The Home Office has dedicated £200,000 towards setting up the ‘hub’ in the hope it will see more web users tracked down and prosecuted for causing offence on social media.

A small team of officers will be dedicated to assessing reports of perceived abuse made to the police’s True Vision ‘hate crime’ reporting platform, which was used by pro-EU campaigners to claim Brexit had caused a wave of ‘hate crimes’.

The police will also spend their time contacting tech firms to demand that ‘hate speech’ is deleted from the internet, the Mail on Sunday reports.

Home Secretary Amber Rudd said Saturday night: “Online hate crime is completely unacceptable.

“What is illegal offline is illegal online, and those who commit these cowardly crimes should be met with the full force of the law.

“The national online hate crime hub that we are funding is an important step to ensure more victims have the confidence to come forward and report the vile abuse to which they are being subjected.”

Last year, the London mayor’s office for policing and crime (Mopac) announced it was spending £1,730,726 of taxpayers’ money policing speech online after applying for a grant from the Home Office.

Sadiq Khan’s office promised to set up a police “online hate crime hub” to work in “partnership with social media providers” to criminalise “trolls” who “target … individuals and communities”.

Last year, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) confirmed that no evidence is needed to bring a criminal complaint against someone for a “hate crime”, as “reporting … is subjective and is based on the perception of the victim”.

“In order to treat a crime as a hate crime for the purposes of investigation, there is no need for evidence to prove the aggravating element,” the guidelines add.

“Hate crimes” receive harsher sentences than other crimes, and “aggravating” factors are often vague, such as the definition of “transphobia”.",1
"TOWSON, MD — When the Black Lives Matter sign was taken from Towson Unitarian Universalist Church over the weekend, it was not the first time such an act had happened. Nor was it the second or the third. The banner removed between Saturday night and Sunday morning marked the seventh time a Black Lives Matter banner has been taken since the church first installed it in October 2016, according to WBAL. In the first five weeks after its appearance along Dulaney Valley Road last fall, Fox 45 reported the banner was vandalized five times, which Rev. Clare Petersberger said showed it carried an important message. Police surveillance around the sign was conducted in January and February but did not yield a suspect, Baltimore County police told the Towson Times, adding that clandestine investigative methods are underway after a combination of yard signs and banners were removed or defaced in recent months. Why the vandalism and theft from a church that promotes an intentionally inclusive community? The church is hosting a community conversation about why it has chosen to display the message Black Lives Matter on its signage and to invite a dialogue about the issue. The event will be from 1:45 to 4 p.m. on Sunday, Nov. 12, at Towson Universalist Church, 1700 Dulaney Valley Road. Rev.

"(Reuters/Jessica Gow/TT News Agency)Swedens Minister for Justice and Migration Morgan Johansson speaks during a presser at the Swedish government headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden, November 5, 2015.

The Swedish government has recently announced that it is considering to amend its existing hate crime legislation to include gender expression and identity as criteria in protecting individuals against discrimination.

Swedens hate crime law, known as incitement to hatred, currently applies to speech aimed at individuals based on sexual orientation, race and religious belief, according to Breitbart News. Swedish Justice Minister Morgan Johansson said that the existing law would be amended to cover gender identity and expression.

This is a special vulnerable group, which has been exposed to hate for a long time, Johansson said.

The justice minister noted that the new measure would also make it illegal for anyone to discriminate against individuals based on their gender expression, adding that it was important to highlight that the government is concerned about this type of harassment.

Since 2014, the Swedish government has looked into adding transgender as one of the criteria in the hate crime legislation, and the current administration had campaigned to amend the measure in the last election.

The government also proposed changing the law even further by dropping the word race by July of next year.

We want to distance ourselves from the concept of race, which of course lacks any scientific evidence that we can divide mankind into races, Johansson contended.

The proposal came just weeks after the Canadian Senate passed a measure that makes it illegal to use the wrong gender pronouns.

The legislation, known as Bill C-16, adds gender identity and expression to Canadas Human Rights Code and to the Criminal Codes hate crime section.

The measure, which was passed by the Senate by a vote of 67–11, is now awaiting royal assent from the House of Commons to become law.

Critics have feared that the legislation would compel Canadians to use preferred pronouns under risk of fines and possible jail time.

One of the bills fiercest critics was University of Toronto psychology professor Dr. Jordan Peterson, who condemned Bill C-16 in one of his videos, saying it requires compelled speech.

Campaign Life Coalition, the political arm of Canadas pro-life movement, also denounced the passage of the legislation.

This tyrannical bill is nothing but social engineering to the nth degree, all in the name of political correctness, said Campaign Lifes Toronto vice president Jeff Gunnarson.

Jack Fonseca, the groups senior political strategist, expressed concern that the measure would be used against Christians.

Mark my words, this law will not be used as some sort of shield to defend vulnerable transsexuals, but rather as a weapon with which to bludgeon people of faith and free-thinking Canadians who refuse to deny truth, he said.",1

"This article was originally published on The Conversation. Read the original article.

Hate crimes against Muslims have been on the rise. The murder of two Samaritans for aiding two young women who were facing a barrage of anti-Muslim slurs on a Portland, Oregon, train is among the latest examples of brazen acts of anti-Islamic hatred.

Earlier in 2017, a mosque in Victoria, Texas, was burned to the ground by an alleged anti-Muslim bigot. And just last year, members of a small extremist group called The Crusaders plotted a bombing “bloodbath” at a residential housing complex for Somali-Muslim immigrants in Garden City, Kansas.

I have analyzed hate crime for two decades at California State University, San Bernardino’s Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism. And I have found that the rhetoric politicians use after terrorist attacks is correlated closely to sharp increases and decreases in hate crimes.

Hate Crimes Post 9/11

Since 1992 (following the promulgation of the Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990), the FBI has annually tabulated hate-crime data voluntarily submitted from state and territorial reporting agencies. A hate crime is defined as a criminal offense motivated by either race, ethnicity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender or gender identity.

According to the FBI’s data, hate crimes against Muslims that were reported to police surged immediately following the terror attacks of 9/11. There were 481 crimes reported against Muslims in 2001, up from 28 the year before. However, from 2002 until 2014, the number of anti-Muslim crimes receded to a numerical range between 105 and 160 annually. That number was still several times higher than the pre-9/11 levels.

It should be noted that other government data, such as the Bureau of Justice Statistics, which relies on almost 200,000 residential crime surveys as opposed to police reports, show severe official undercounting of hate crimes. Those studies, based on respondents’ answers to researchers, indicate a far higher annual average of hate crime—250,000 nationally—with over half stating that they never reported such offenses to police.

Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now

FBI data show that in 2015 there were 257 hate crimes against Muslims—the highest level since 2001 and a surge of 67 percent over the previous year.

As I noted in a prepared statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee in May 2017, this was the second-highest number of anti-Muslim hate crimes since FBI record-keeping began in 1992. Not only did anti-Muslim crime cases rise numerically in 2015, they also grew as a percentage of all hate crime. They now account for 4.4 percent of all reported hate crime, even though Muslims are estimated to be only 1 percent of the population.

When Do the Spikes Happen?

At our center, we analyzed even more recent disturbing trends related to hate crimes. Based on the latest available police data for 2016 from 25 of the nation’s largest cities and counties, we found a 6 percent increase in all hate crimes, with over half of the places at a multiyear high. In particular, hate crimes against Muslims had increased in six of the seven places that provided more detailed breakdowns.

We also observed a spike in such crime following certain events.

In 2015, for example, we found 45 incidents of anti-Muslim crime in the United States in the four weeks following the November 13 Paris terror attack.

Just under half of these occurred after December 2, when the San Bernardino terror attack took place. Of those, 15 took place in the five days following then-candidate Donald Trump’s proposal of December 7, seeking to indefinitely ban all Muslims from entering the United States.

In contrast, as I observed in my prepared statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee, after an initial sharp spike following the 9/11 attacks, sociologist James Nolan and I found that there was a drop in hate crimes after President George W. Bush delivered a speech promoting tolerance on Sept. 17, 2001.

Other groups, too, have found similar spikes in anti-Muslim hatred. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), for example, noted that from the month of the presidential election through Dec. 12, 2016, there was a spike in hate “incidents” against many minority groups. The SPLC found that the third most frequently targeted group after immigrants and African-Americans were Muslims. And just this month, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim advocacy group, reported 72 instances of “harassment” and 69 hate crimes that had occurred between April and June 2017.

Fear of Muslims

Prejudicial stereotypes that broadly paint Muslims in a negative light are quite pervasive.

From 2002 to 2014, the number of respondents who stated that Islam was more likely to encourage violence doubled from 25 percent to 50 percent, according to Pew research. A June 2016 Reuters/Ipsos online poll found that 37 percent of Americans had a somewhat or very unfavorable view of Islam, topped only by antipathy for atheism, at 38 percent.

The latest polls also show how Muslims are feared and distrusted as a group in America. While most Americans do not believe that Muslims living in the U.S. support extremism, these views vary widely by age, level of education and partisan affiliation: Almost half of those 65 and older believe that Muslims in America support extremism, whereas only few college-educated adults do so.

Interestingly, current polls also show that when people personally know someone who is a Muslim, the bias is much less. This confirms what psychology scholar Gordon Allport concludes in his seminal book The Nature of Prejudice: that meaningful contact with those who are different is crucial for reducing hatred.

Indeed, before we can truly say “love thy neighbor(s),” we need to know and understand them.

"SACRAMENTO (CBS13) — New California gun legislation would ban anyone convicted of hate crimes from purchasing a gun.

Current law bans criminals convicted of felonies from owning guns.

The Disarm Hate Act would apply to misdemeanor hate crimes.

Charleston. Orlando. San Bernardino.

It doesn’t matter where the shooting happens, Assemblyman Reggie Jones-Sawyer (D-Los Angeles), says the motive is often the same: hate.

“We always understood it but it’s risen to a level I’ve never seen, ever,” said Jones-Sawyer.

Jones-Sawyer says hate crimes are precursors to more serious crimes. And he says he can curb gun violence by targeting people convicted of misdemeanor hate crimes.

“We decided to go in close that loop, prohibit them from owning a firearm,” he said.

The Disarm Hate Act, bans anyone convicted of a hate crime from owning a gun for 10 years after the conviction. The bill would take away gun rights for anyone convicted of vandalizing places of worship or committing a crime against someone based on their race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.

“Everything is written so broad that sooner or later we’re not gonna to be able to walk down the street,” said Josh Deaser of Just Guns.

Deaser worries the law would be applied to petty crime, like someone shouting a racial slur.

“I mean, are you actively picketing in front of a church? Are you just saying hey I don’t like Hillary Clinton?” Said Deaser.

The FBI says hate crimes have surged in recent years. Now California lawmakers say they’re seeking harsher penalties… before it happens again.

The bill passed in Assembly with zero opposition and heads to a public safety committee Tuesday.",1
"The FBI and local authorities are looking into whether the fatal stabbing of a Black college student who was killed while visiting the University of Maryland over the weekend was a hate crime.

According to the Baltimore Sun, Richard Collins III, was stabbed by a White University of Maryland student who is a member of a racist Facebook group. Collins was due to graduate from Bowie State University this week. He had completed ROTC at the school, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the army on Thursday.







He was 23.

22-year-old Christopher Urbanski has been charged with first-degree murder in the attack and is reportedly being held without bond.

“We are looking forward to the quickest investigation as possible,” Bowie State University President, Artie Lee Travis said. “Hate has no place in America. Hate has no place on a college campus where young minds are coming together to try to change the world.”

Collins was described by friends as vibrant, funny and outgoing. He had a desire to travel the world and go skydiving and surfing, his friend and fellow Bowie State University student Vidal Adams said.

“He wanted to be a general of the United States Army, that was his ultimate goal,” said Adams, a senior criminal justice major. “He was the definition of a leader. I can’t really say the same about a lot of people.”",1
"About 60 per cent of Americans admitted that they knew nothing about the community, according to National Sikh Campaign.

A 39-year-old Sikh was shot at earlier this year by a partially masked gunman, who asked him to “go back to your own country” in Kent, Washington. In April, a Sikh cab driver was assaulted and his turban was taken off by four drunken passengers in an incident that is believed to be a hate crime incident.

Incidents of hate crimes and racism are nothing new for the Sikh community in the United States, which first faced the issue after 9/11. Since then, Sikh-Americans have seen an increase in hate crimes against them because their long beards and turbans make them more visible than other minority groups, and also makes them prone to being recognised as Muslim hardliners.

Sikh-American activists have raised their voice against the intolerant climate spreading in the US. One such non-profit organisation, National Sikh Campaign (NSC), launched a nationwide million-dollar campaign called ‘We are Sikhs’ in April to spread awareness about the minority community. Four months later, the group is still going strong to spread the message about their faith.

The organisers believe that it’s the unawareness about Sikhs in America that is dangerous. They want to tell Americans what turban or the kirpan stands for, and bring them closer to understanding the Sikh faith.

Over 65 per cent of Americans are ignorant about Sikhism and they aim to use this initiative to spread awareness about the religion and Sikh-Americans, according to the NSC.

Rajwant Singh, the co-founder and senior advisor of the National Sikh Campaign, said that the initiative is a “national effort to help inform our fellow Americans about who we are and why we are proud to wear the turban, a symbol of our community’s commitment to equality and serving others,” PTI had reported.

Using marketing, public relations and social media, the campaign aims to highlight the Sikh-American community’s increasing presence in national and local news outlets, online platforms and neighbourhoods.

“Sikh-Americans are pillars of their communities in every corner of our nation and we must work to proactively meet and connect with our neighbours,” Singh said.

There exists a “collective misunderstanding” of what the turban means in the US, because of which the community has been the target of discrimination and hate crimes, especially since the 9/11 terror attacks, the organisation said.

“Sikh values are American values, and Sikh-Americans have been making positive and significant contributions to American life for more than a century. We run local businesses and sing our national anthem with pride,” Gurwin Singh Ahuja, the co- founder and executive director of the NSC, said.

The American dream is a fundamental part of the Sikh community’s identity in America and they “deeply in the freedom to pursue one’s own success through hard work,” Ahuja added.

“We have brought a very scientific and targeted messaging element to the campaign. Our focus is to build a proactive and positive message and try to educate and inform Americans about the positive contributions the Sikhs have been making in America,” Singh said.

With this massive campaign, NSC hopes to create awareness about the Sikh faith and promote inclusivity and positive attitude towards the minority community in US.",1

Eight-and-a-half years after a Native American woman was found beaten and left for dead near Roosevelt Park in southeast Albuquerque, detectives have indicted a suspect in the case, charging him with murder as a hate crime.

The case had been cold for years when detectives identified 41-year-old Roger Paul Preston, who was already in prison, as a suspect, according to officer Simon Drobik, a spokesman for the Albuquerque Police Department. He said detectives would not comment on what tied Preston to the victim or how he became a suspect.

And Michael Patrick, a spokesman for the District Attorney’s Office, wouldn’t say what circumstances caused the killing to be considered a hate crime, although he did say that race was a factor.

“(Prosecutors) are saying that based on the race of the victim and the events that had transpired that’s why they feel the hate crime enhancement was levied,” Patrick said.

Drobik said on July 4, 2009, shortly before 2 a.m., police were called to the 500 block of Maple SE, near Coal. When they arrived they found Cato “Terri” Benally with a severe head injury lying in the street. Benally is transgender and had been living as a female, Drobik said. Previous news reports refer to Benally as him.

“Terri was rushed to the hospital but unfortunately died from the injuries,” Drobik wrote in an email. “Violent crimes worked the case but it became cold and was forwarded to the APD Cold Case Unit.”

He said the cold case unit began investigating the case in 2013 and identified Preston as a suspect.

Preston had been behind bars since 2010, when he pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree murder, conspiracy and tampering with evidence in the near-deadly beating of another Native American. According to a criminal complaint filed in Metropolitan Court, two days after Benally’s death, Preston got into a fight with Ronald Begay after spotting him riding a bike near Zuni and Ortiz SE. He repeatedly beat him with his fists and a bat, until he appeared to be dead, before stealing his wallet and bike.

Preston was sentenced to 15 years in prison and was locked up at the Southern New Mexico Correctional Facility in Las Cruces.

That’s where he was being held Monday when a Bernalillo County grand jury indicted him on the charge of first-degree murder with a “hate crime enhancement.”",1

"Utah Legislature may consider a bill during its 2018 general session aiming to clarify and enhance penalties for Utah hate crimes law. Composite for illustration includes background photo of Utah Capitol, by desertsolitaire, and foreground cropped photo of two men fighting, by mrohana, both photos iStock / Getty Images Plus; St. George News

ST. GEORGE – A bill proposing to enhance criminal penalties in cases where individuals are targeted based on ethnicity, gender, religion, gender identity or sexual orientation has returned to the Utah Legislature.

Sen. Daniel Thatcher, R-West Valley City, filed Senate Bill 86, “Victim Targeting Penalty Enhancements,” earlier this month for a run through the 2018 legislative session.

The bill is similar to legislation Thatcher sponsored last year, which, while introduced, never received a committee hearing. That bill came in the wake of 2016 legislation sponsored by former Sen. Steve Urquhart, R-St. George, which made it through the Utah Senate but not the House.

Read more: New hate crimes bill introduced for 2017 legislative session – 2017

Urquhart placed part of the blame for his bill’s death at the feet of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Mirroring last year’s legislation, Senate Bill 86 would add sexual orientation and gender identity to the list of bias-targeted groups, as well as increase the penalty for crimes committed by a degree of offense.

For example, a class A misdemeanor would be bumped up to a third-degree felony if the crime involved is found to be motivated by a bias against the group the victim belongs to.

And this is where the issue can get “complicated,” Thatcher said during an interview with St. George News.

The victim-targeting bill focuses on the actions a potential offender takes against a certain group, and not someone’s thoughts, ideas and associations, which are protected as free speech.

He used the example of a man who may be a known white supremacist and even maintains a blog where he spews out racist ideologies. However, if this same man assaults someone who is a part of a protected class, his existing associations and writings cannot be considered as evidence for a “hate crime,” as those are protected under the First Amendment.

“You can’t even consider speech,” Thatcher said.

Still, the assault charge the man would face would could be modified under Thatcher’s bill if investigators are able to tie the man’s words and writings to the specific incident. This would better establish that the crime was meant to “send a message” to the group the victim belongs to, and not necessarily the victim only.

“I’m interested in the messaging of the crime,” Thatcher said. “The crime is not about a single person but the message it sends to a community.”

Opposition to the bill has included worries over an individual’s freedom of speech being violated, Thatcher said. His bill does not go after someone for “thought crimes.”

“You’re not being judged for your thoughts or your feelings,” he said.

Another facet of pushback has involved the question of why modifiers are needed in the first place.

The Libertas Institute, a libertarian think-tank based in Lehi, states on its website that “the motives involved in a crime are not important to the action itself.”

Libertas continues: “Whether an assault was instigated by the aggressor’s jealousy, drunkenness, anger, or ‘in part’ due to a discriminatory ‘perception’ about the victim’s personal characteristics is immaterial. Taxpayers should not be required to subsidize higher incarceration rates in pursuit of misnamed ‘social justice.’”

Utah originally passed hate crimes legislation over 20 years ago. However, advocates have long said the current law is useless and unenforceable.

“Advocates point out that in Utah, it’s hard for prosecutors to convict people who’ve committed hate crimes,” Equality Utah, an LGBTQ advocacy group, states on its website. “Just like any other law, Utah’s current hate crimes law does prosecute crimes like assault or theft. But the law doesn’t acknowledge when these crimes are motivated by bias or hate.”

The current law also doesn’t have the words “bias” or “prejudice” in its language, Equality Utah states.

“Our current laws don’t work,” Thatcher said.

Further support for the bill has been voiced by the Rev. Oscar Solis, bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Salt Lake City, as well as several other faith leaders in the state. They shared their support for Thatcher’s bill through a letter sent to the Legislature.

The letter cites the early history of the LDS church during a time when its members were persecuted for their faith and ultimately driven west where they built what would become Utah. Church founder Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum Smith were also described as victims of a hate crime due to being killed because of their faith.

“The not-so-subtle message to all others of those same race, ethnicities and religions is simple: you don’t belong here, go somewhere else. That was the same message Mormons got from 19th century mobs in Missouri and Illinois: Joseph and Hyrum Smith were murdered because of their religion.” the letter states.

“I really, really hope people listen to (Solis),” Thatcher said.

The bill has yet to be heard by a Senate committee. The LDS church has not yet issued any statement regarding Thatcher’s bill.

"Brianna Brochu is charged with criminal mischief and breach of peace for harassing her roommate. (Mark Mirko/The Courant via AP, Pool)

A white former University of Hartford student accused of harassing her African-American roommate was not charged with a hate crime, a turn in the case which angered the local civil rights community.

Activists wanted prosecutors to add a hate crime charge to the criminal mischief and breach of peace charges against Brianna Brochu, 18, for her attack against Chennel Jazzy Rowe, her roommate at Hartford.

However, prosecutors did not add the additional charge, NBC News reported , and Brochu rejected the allegation race was a factor in the harassment.

She told the Republican-American she did foolish, stupid acts, but insisted Im not racist. Brochu told police Rowe was rude to her and posted videos online of her snoring to make fun of her, the Hartford Courant reported

I think that when its all said and done, what youre going to see is that there was nothing racist that motivated this, said Brochus lawyer, Tom Stevens. These were two students who were placed together ... who didnt like each other ... and it escalated.

But Abdul-Shahid Muhammad Ansari, president of the NAACP Greater Hartford Branch said at the hearing he and other NAACP members are not happy with the decision.

She should be charged with a hate crime, he told NBC. We made our feelings known and will continue to do so, letting the community know and elected officials know as well.

Brochu was expelled from the university after her alleged harassment was exposed. Police say Brochu wrote on Instagram she rubbed used tampons on Rowes bookbag and put her toothbrush where the sun doesnt shine. She also called Rowe a Jamaican Barbie, put moldy clam dip in her skin-care products and spit in her coconut oil, according to NBC .

In a Facebook Live video detailing the alleged harassment, Rowe said she developed extreme throat pain, but doctors couldnt come up with a diagnosis. She requested a room change from the university and was moving her belongings on Oct. 17 when Brochus Instagram message surfaced, according to the Hartford Courant.",1
"Westchester County District Attorney Janet DiFiore announced that Scott Yandrasevich (DOB 2/25/1964) of 11 Abbey Lane, Danbury, Connecticut, was arraigned today on an eleven indictment charging him with:   Between April 10th, 2007 and August 20, 2012, the defendant, who was the General Manager of the Rye Golf Club, located at 330 Boston Post Road, in Rye, New York, stole approximately $342,120 from the Club and the City of Rye by knowingly submitting false invoices to the City of Rye for fictitious employees over this approximate four and a half year period.  The club is a Rye City owned non-equity membership club.  The defendant accomplished this larceny by setting up and effectively controlling a staffing company called RM Staffing for the purposes of billing the City of Rye for services provided to the Club.  The defendant submitted false bi-weekly invoices on RM Staffing stationary listing individual(s) who were falsely described as working in Administration, Restaurant and/or Operations at the Club, when in fact no such person(s) worked for the Club.  In total, these fraudulent invoices were submitted during a span of over one hundred pay periods and the City of Rye paid out approximately $342,120 to RM Staffing for these fictional services.  After RM Staffing received these stolen monies, said stolen monies were ultimately transferred back to the defendant, who used said funds for his own personal use.  The City became aware of financial irregularities, hired outside counsel who further investigated and forwarded those findings to the District Attorneys office. Bail was continued at $10,000 cash or bond.  The defendants next court date is May 21st, 2014.  He faces a maximum sentence of fifteen years in state prison.  Assistant District Attorney Brian Conway, Deputy Chief of the Public Integrity Bureau is prosecuting the case.",0

"The trial began on Jan.6 after more than two years of delays, which D.C. Superior Court Judge Russell Canan said Muth deliberately caused to avoid trial. Muth has purposely fasted on and off, forcing his hospitalization. Mr. Muths absence here is of his own making, Canan said during a Jan.7 trial session. Muth watched and listened to the trial from his hospital bed using videoconferencing technology. According to the Washington Post, Muth was asked if he wanted to testify via videoconference on Tuesday but refused. Muth, looking thin and frail with his hands folded on his stomach and a sheet pulled up to his chest and handcuffs on the bed rail next to him, said he did not want to testify, the article said. Read full coverage by the Washington Post here. At the start of the trial on Jan. 7, prosecutor Glenn Kirschner said that Muth had a history of abusing Drath and pointed to several instances of domestic violence, including a 1992 court conviction that Muth had beaten Drath, blackening her eyes. This homicide… this murder was a long time coming, Kirschner said. Kirschner also pointed to Muths drunken state the night of Draths murder, signs that Drath had been dragged to the bathroom where she was found dead, Google searches by Muth on the night of Draths death for extradition to Mexico, flights to Iceland and crossing the Canadian border, and an allegedly phony modification to Draths will. Muths attorney Craig Hickein said that Kirschners claims were simply a theory and that his material was not evidence that Muth was involved with Draths death. Hickein pointed to a lack of DNA evidence and Muths cooperation with police. Albrecht Muth didnt hide; he didnt flee; he didnt need to, Hickein said. If convicted of Draths first-degree murder, Muth faces life in prison. Check back here for updates on the lawyers closing statements and the jury decision.",0

"The bomb caught the countrys attention, but wasn’t the first time Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center had been targeted.

On a recent Saturday, one week after a bomb was detonated inside the Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington, Mohamed Omar stood outside the mosque. Traces of the blast and messages of support still remained on display.

As he thought back to that fateful day, Omar, executive director of the center, could only thank two things for his surivival: God and the brick wall that stood between the room where the explosion occurred and the couch where he napped as he waited for the morning prayer.

“If that wall wasn’t made of bricks,” said Omar, pointing to the now windowless conference room that once hosted important guests, “it would have been over for me.”

The bomb caught the country’s attention, but wasn’t the first time the mosque had been targeted. Its congregation has been subjected to death threats and intimidation before, including several incidents where people stood outside the mosque, shouting racial and anti-Muslim slurs at worshipers entering or leaving the center, said Omar.

Such events have become increasingly common occurrences in Minnesota. And in the wake of the Bloomington bombing incident, which Gov. Mark Dayton called “an act of terrorism,” mosque leaders in Minnesota are increasingly talking about ways to improve their practice of documenting and reporting hate incidents to the police — a practice that hasn’t been common up to now.

“We’re a new community, very fragile and vulnerable,” Omar said. “If something happens, calling the police would be the last thing to come to mind. We’d think twice because we don’t know what’s going to come out of that.”

Rise of anti-Muslim incidents

Though anti-Muslim violence has long existed in the United States, especially after 9/11, it’s become more widespread over the last 18 months, especially as anti-Muslim and anti-immigration rhetoric became a regular part of the 2016 presidential campaign.

Since the election, Omar said, people have come to the Islamic center’s parking lot area with their cars, yelled anti-Islam and racial insults, and drove away. One of those incidents, however, was more than just screaming racial slurs. “A man came and threatened to bomb the place,” Omar said. “We asked him why. He said ‘You’re bringing the country Sharia law.’”

Around the same time, the Islamic Da’wa Center in St. Paul also received similar threats — some of which the mosque reported to the law enforcement. “There have been many hate incidents targeting our mosque,” said Hassan Mohamud, who heads the center. “One day, there was a poster posted on the door. It had insulting messages about the Prophet Mohammad.”

MinnPost photo by Ibrahim Hirsi Mohamed Omar: “We want everybody in the community to take these threats seriously.”

Mohamud Farah, the executive director of Masjid Al-Rawdah in south Minneapolis, said the mosque hasn’t gotten any form of threats or anti-Muslim messages, though he’s been personally subject to racial harassment on the streets. One of those incidents, Farah said, happened just a week ago on Lake Street. As he waited at a red light, a motorist next to him unleashed racial slurs and spat towards him. “It happened in broad daylight,” he said. “It was really scary.”

Reporting anti-Muslim bias

Even as anti-Muslim incidents have increased across the state, however, mosque leaders and victims are often reluctant to report to police.

There are many reasons for that, and one of them has to do with culture, Omar said. Some Muslim immigrants, for example, came from places where threats and intimidation have always been part of their lives. “For me, it never made sense to report a threat,” he added. “I always thought that if someone threatens you, you just tell them get out of here” and move on.

Like Omar, Farah said that it’s rare that members of the Muslim community — especially Somalis — report verbal assaults, except when there is physical abuse involved. “I didn’t report what happened to me at the traffic light,” he added. “It just didn’t come to me.”

Omar and other mosque leaders want to change that. That’s why Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center and Islamic Da’wa Center are organizing classes that would provide imams and community members training on how to respond to harassment and threats.

“We want everybody in the community to take these threats seriously,” Omar said. “They don’t have to wait until something happens to them … because the main reason we report such threats is to prevent a potential danger.”

Through the training, leaders also hope to change a commonly held perception in the community: that 911 operators and police officers will mark their contact information if they call for help more than three times. “They believe that their homes or centers would be designated as a crime scene,” Omar said. “So they try their best to avoid making it to the list.”

The training is also meant to educate undocumented immigrants about ways they can report threats — and to dispel the common myth and misconceptions that they’ll face deportation if they report crimes or testify in court. “These kinds of conversations are more important now than ever,” Mohamud said. “We are living in difficult time, and we need to equip the community with the right tools.”",1

"Another act of vandalism has been reported at the Islamic Center of Davis.

On Monday, the Davis Police Department was informed that a bicycle parked at the Russell Boulevard mosque had its tires slashed sometime between 1 and 1:30 p.m. Saturday.

“We’re following up on it, trying to get surveillance video,” Lt. Tom Waltz said of the vandalism, which has been classified as a hate crime.

The night before, someone tossed cut-up computer printer paper containing text from the Quran, the Islamic sacred book, from a moving car in front of the Islamic Center while adults prayed inside and children played outdoors.

So far it’s unclear whether the two acts are related, and Waltz said there are no new developments in the paper-strewing, which police consider a hate incident. Anyone with information about possible suspects is asked to call Davis police at 530-747-5400.

Also unknown is whether they’re connected to a Sacramento incident in which a burned Quran was attached with handcuffs to a chain-link fence in the parking lot of the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department, which is next door to the Masjid Annur Islamic Center in South Sacramento.

All occurred a week after Davis resident Lauren Kirk-Coehlo was sentenced to five years’ probation for smashing windows, vandalizing bikes and draping raw bacon, a prohibited food for Muslims, at the mosque back on Jan. 22.

"PoliZette PC Madness: Student Investigated for Mocking ‘Barbarian’ Terrorists Administrators and peers accuse law student of blatant Islamophobia for Facebook post critical of ISIS

A law student at the prestigious University of Edinburgh in Scotland has been put under investigation by university administrators for an alleged “hate crime,” after writing a Facebook post critical of the Islamic State.

Law student Robbie Travers was accused by a peer of “putting minority students at risk and in a state of panic” — for celebrating a successful U.S. air strike against ISIS targets.

“I’m glad we could bring these barbarians a step closer to collecting their 72 virgins,” Travers wrote on Facebook in April following the airstrike.

[lz_jwplayer video=DYA3oz6n]

In response to Travers’ post, Edinburgh student Esme Allman filed an official complaint with the university for what Allman charged was “blatant Islamophobia” that was “putting minority students at risk and in a state of panic.”

Allman is a self-identified “womanist” and proponent of “intersectionality,” an ideology that says identities can “intersect” — that is to say, they effectively combine — to make an individual more oppressed by the dominant culture.

“I am a self-proclaimed feminist and womanist from inner-city London, and have a strong interest in intersectionality,” Allman writes in her 2017 election manifesto for the position of the Edinburgh University Student Association’s (EUSA) Black & Minority Ethnic (BME) Officer.

“As a BME student, I value inclusivity as well as building and preserving safe spaces for us,” Allman continues. “Creating a truly intersectional campaign is incredibly important to me and my first job will be to work alongside the other liberation groups to ensure EUSA are fully representative of our views.”

Intersectionality holds, for example, that a black woman is more oppressed than a white woman because she is black, and more oppressed than a black man because she is also a woman. Likewise, a transgender black woman would be more oppressed than a black woman because she has the additional oppressed identity of being transgender.

“This view has been endorsed by the National Union of Students in the past. It’s completely wrong, but I’m sure many believe it, and, sadly, there are many who go further and actively support ISIS in the U.K.,” said Ben Harris-Quinney, chairman of The Bow Group, the U.K.’s oldest conservative think tank.

According to an update on Facebook Travers posted Monday evening, more charges have been leveled against him by students he says are ideologically motivated because of his journalistic efforts exposing far-left anti-Semitism on campus.

“An update into the University of Edinburgh investigation into me: I now stand accused of ‘lying about anti-semitism’ and ‘radicalisation amongst BME students,” Travers posted on Facebook. “I am absolutely heartbroken that after hard years of work in exposing and writing about anti-semitism, my work in exposing malignant and repulsive Jew hate is now branded a ‘lie.”

[lz_related_box id=”834447″]

“Worse, not a single piece of tangible evidence has been provided to support this claim. Lawyers I have engaged now believe this malicious report into me may be motivated by anti-semitism and desired to silence an individual, myself, who has previously exposed Edinburgh students noting that ‘gassing Zionists’ would be ‘too good for them,’ and using racist slurs such as ‘Zio,” he wrote.

Harris-Quinney says Travers’ experience is indicative of the Left’s campaign to intimidate opposing voices on college campuses.

“What we have seen over the past few years across campuses — the closing down of debate, the persecution of those who hold challenging views, and the sanitization of the University experience — represents a real threat to the future of our civilization,” he told LifeZette. “Free speech should be a cornerstone of any university’s philosophy, and students should be allowed to think and say as they please, even if their views are considered controversial.”

“What we have however, is a situation where even uncontroversial and common views are being censored,” Harris-Quinney said. “If British universities are unable to act as a forum for even basic levels of debate and thought, they must fail to achieve the higher thought that previously made them the envy of the world.”

On Wednesday, May 31, visitors at the National Museum of African American History and Culture found a noose in the Segregation Exhibit, only a few days after a noose was found hanging on a tree outside the Hirshhorn Museum on Friday, May 27. Museum Directors have called the crime a “deplorable act of cowardice and depravity” meant to depict America’s Jim Crow years where African Americans were routinely lynched by mobs of white Americans.[i]

This crime is only the most recent in a long line of hate crimes by extremists emboldened by President Trump’s election last fall. On April 4, 2017, a butcher in New York City handed his African American deliveryman a noose to be used should he feel “any stress” and offered to assist him in using it.[ii][iii] On the American University campus, bananas were hung in nooses on the night of May 1st, meant to illustrate African Americans as monkeys.[iv] In March 2017, the State Attorney’s Office in Florida was mailed a noose meant for an African American attorney.[v] On May 22, an African American Bowie State University student was stabbed to death by another student who was a member of the Alt-Reich: Nation Facebook group.[vi] Of course, hatred is not exclusively reserved for African Americans; authorities have recorded numerous instances of hate against Muslim, Hispanic, Jewish, and LGBT communities.[vii] Attacks which directly reference support for President Trump have run rampant since his election: a Muslim student at San Diego State University was attacked in November 2016 by men screaming about Trump and Muslim hatred.[viii] Trump was slow to address hate crimes in the United States, and after a long-awaited, watered-down speech addressing anti-Semitism, the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect called his statement “a Band-Aid on the cancer of anti-Semitism.”[ix] The two nooses found on the Smithsonian grounds are attacks not only linked to each other, but also a part of a greater context, and a hatred that exposes itself with President Trump’s tacit approval.

This last act was not a prank. It was a hate crime and should be treated as such. Only months after its opening, this museum has proven itself extremely popular. You cannot simply walk up to the museum and enter. You must purchase tickets online, often three months in advance. Same-day passes are offered at 6:30 AM, but are usually sold-out almost immediately. This crime was premeditated, meant to evoke chaos and fear, and gain as much exposure as possible. Crimes of this nature are a sad reminder that this nation has a long way to go in addressing racism and bigotry.

President Trump promised to “Make America Great Again.” Is this the “Great America” he perceived, where entire segments of our population are forced to live in fear? President Trump needs to take a break from Twitter, and use his influence as President to make a statement acknowledging these acts as crimes and urging an immediate halt to this hateful spread of violence.

As the national discourse on race, religion and sexual orientation became increasingly heated in 2017, the number of hate crimes in California jumped significantly for the third consecutive year.

According to an annual report from the state Department of Justice, released Monday, hate crimes reported by law enforcement agencies rose by 17.4 percent from 2016 to 2017. That follows double-digit increases in 2015 and 2016, after six years of steady decline.

The number of hate-crime incidents in 2017 increased in every major category — race, religion and sexual orientation. African Americans and gay men were most likely to fall victim to hate crimes.

African Americans were targets in 27.6 percent of 2017 hate crimes, with gay men the victims in 15.7 percent.

However, Latinos or Hispanics were increasingly the subjects of hate crimes, with a 51.8 percent increase over 2016 as debate raged over illegal immigration and a wall at the nation’s southern border.

Now Playing:

Representatives of Bay Area anti-discrimination groups said the statistics were significant and daunting but unsurprising, given the current political and social environment.

“This is a disturbing rise in hate crimes,” said Nancy Appel, senior associate director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Central Pacific Region. “The numbers have been going up in recent years, but this is a significant increase across categories.”

The Rev. Amos Brown, president of the San Francisco branch of the NAACP, blamed the increase in hate crimes on President Trump, saying his remarks, in speeches and on Twitter, have made discrimination and hate acceptable.

“This president has emboldened those who are perpetrators of hate with his rhetoric, his vulgarity and with his outright abusive language attacking people from Caribbean Islands and from Africa,” he said. “It begins at the top.”

Hate crimes based on religion also rose — by 21.1 percent compared with the prior year. Anti-Jewish incidents increased by 26.8 percent, while crimes against Muslims rose by 24.3 percent.

Hate crimes in 2017 included a vicious attack on a Sikh man in Richmond who was beaten and whose hair was cut with a knife by two white men. The Sikh faith requires that men’s hair remain uncut and wrapped in a turban. Also, a mosque in Davis was vandalized, its windows broken and its handles wrapped in bacon.

The surge in hate crimes comes as overall crime statistics show a small increase — of about 1.5 percent — in the violent crime rate per 100,000 people and a decrease of 2.1 percent in the property crime rate.

The report also showed that the state’s homicide rate decreased from 4.9 to 4.6 per 100,000 population from 2016 to 2017. The arson rate increased 10.7 and the rape rate rose by 6.9 per 100,000 population.

"CLOSE State Senators Greg Taylor and John Ruckelshaus, from opposite sides of the aisle, are hoping to pass hate crime legislation in Indiana, Monday, August 28, 2017. Robert Scheer/IndyStar

When the most recent effort to pass hate crimes legislation in Indiana fizzled in the Indiana Senate earlier this year, a pair of lawmakers — one a black Democrat, the other a white Republican — made a promise to one another.

They would not let the conversation end. They would meet to work on a bipartisan bill for next year. And they would do it at Starbucks on the border of their urban and suburban districts.

On Monday, nearly six months later, Sens. Greg Taylor and John Ruckelshaus made good on their promise.

Taylor, an attorney who represents the near northwest side of Indianapolis, told his white colleague what it was like to grow up black in the small, primarily white city of Marion — and about the frustration he has experienced in trying unsuccessfully to pass a hate crimes bill for the past four years.

Ruckelshaus, a businessman who represents Washington Township and parts of Hamilton County, told his black colleague what it was like to father a quadraplegic son — and about the challenges he faces in convincing his fellow Republicans, mostly white and many from rural areas, that hate crimes legislation is necessary.

The next David Duke: Indiana white nationalist isnt stopping with Charlottesville

It was an unlikely bipartisan meeting on a polarizing topic, just a few weeks after a violent white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., where a participant drove his car at high speeds into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing a woman and injuring others.

The events in Charlottesville brought Taylor back to the day in February when Republican opposition effectively killed the latest effort to pass hate crimes legislation in Indiana, one of only five states without such a law.

On that day, Taylor made an impassioned speech lamenting the measures defeat. One statement in particular echoes eerily when viewed through the lens of Charlottesville.

“I just hope that one day we open up our eyes, Taylor said. I hope it’s not after something dramatic happens — and I’m telling you, it’s on the horizon.”

Sitting with Ruckelshaus on Monday at a Starbucks at 56th and Illinois streets, Taylor reflected back on his speech in February.

Some of us saw this coming, he said. It shouldn’t take a young lady dying for us to come together and put this together. While I’m happy we’re moving forward, I wish that premonition hadn’t come true.

Ruckelshaus, who supported the legislation last year, said the violence and openly racist and anti-Semitic displays in Charlottesville could be a game changer for hate crime legislation in Indiana, especially given that white supremacist Matthew Heimbach, one of the rallys top promoters, lives in Indiana.

I think Charlottesville brought it to the forefront, Ruckelshaus said. I don’t want to say it’s easier to sell to my caucus, but it’s more omnipresent in front of them, whereas they didn’t see it necessarily in their backyard. Now seeing what happened in Charlottesville, it’s out there. So let’s get to work.

But it will likely be tough work. Attempts to pass a hate crimes bill have failed for years.

Most recently, a measure authored by Sen. Susan Glick, R-LaGrange, would have allowed judges to impose tougher sentences for crimes motivated by race, religion, sex, disability, gender identity or sexual orientation.

But the measure has faced stiff opposition, primarily from conservative Republicans from rural areas. They argue that hate crime laws create special protected classes that treat victims of similar crimes differently.

The bill passed the Senate in 2016 but did not get a hearing in the House. It was revived again this year but failed to get enough support in the Senate. The measure died in February on the same day a bomb threat was issued to the Indianapolis Jewish Community Center.

For Taylor, the failure to pass hate crimes legislation comes down to this: Many lawmakers in the Republican majority have not given proper weight to the experiences of their minority colleagues.

During Mondays meeting at Starbucks, Taylor recounted an experience growing up in Marion, a city of 30,000 people about 50 miles northeast of Indianapolis.

One day, his grandmothers white employer dropped her off at Taylors home. Taylor, then age 8 or 9, ran up to the car, excited to see his grandmother.

I made the mistake of going to the driver side and ... putting my hands on the side of the car, Taylor said.The lady smacked me and told me, Get your black a-- hands off my car.

The young Taylor cried and received a stark lesson from his grandmother.

She said, There are going to be mean people and there are going to be nice people. She just showed you she’s a mean person, so now you know that you can’t do certain things around her.

Taylors wife, Danielle, is white. They sometimes get strange looks, but on a few occasions, theyve endured more explicit actions, he said.

I’ve experienced people spitting on my car, for example, he said. I’ve experienced my in-laws having things like shaving cream and raisins put on their car when I spent the night at their house.

Ruckelshaus said it is important for lawmakers to hear and learn from one another.

The beauty about this, if that is even a word that is applicable to this, is that I get a chance to work with Sen. Taylor and Rep. Porter and Cherish Pryor who obviously have a perspective on life that I, as a white male, have never experienced, he said.

Over coffee on Monday, Ruckelshaus shared his desire to protect his son, Jay, who became quadriplegic after a diving injury that injured his spine in 2011.

His son has not experienced discrimination because of his disability, but we’ve seen other people who have been discriminated against, and other people who have been in positions where they’ve had hate thrown at them because of their disability. Ruckelshaus said. And that’s another reason I’m fighting for this bill.

He said he recognizes that he has more work to do than Taylor, given that opposition to the bill has come from Republicans. He also acknowledged that Taylor and other Democrats have been pushing this issue for years.

Theres got to be respect from our side on that, he said.

Taylor said the respect is mutual.

John puts himself in situations very few legislators do, he said. He shows up to places where he might not be comfortable. I have no choice but to do that because I’m in a state that’s predominately on the far right of where I’m at. But John doesn’t have to do that.

Their coffee shop meeting — the Starbucks Caffeinated Bipartisan Bias Crimes Summit, they jokingly called it — might not be enough to move the ball forward on hate crimes legislation.

But its a start, they said.

Ruckelshaus, who previously served in the House, said he hopes to use his previous relationships to reassure his Republican colleagues on the other side of the issue at the Statehouse.

One strategy, he said, will be to pitch the legislation as an economic development issue.

We have companies today that make decisions about coming to states — especially technology companies — based upon the quality of life and how they treat citizens, he said.

The legislative session doesnt begin until January, but there are already signs that some Republicans might be more receptive this year.

In the past, House Speaker Brian Bosma and other Republicans have questioned the need for the legislation. They argue that judges already have the discretion to consider a criminals motivation in sentencing.

But after Charlottesville, Bosma told Fox 59 its time to clarify the law to dispel the misconception that hate-related crimes cant already be considered by a judge in sentencing.

Repeated efforts by IndyStar to get a comment from Bosma for this story were unsuccessful.

House Courts and Criminal Code Committee Chairman Thomas Washburne, who declined to hear the bill last year, said he would consider the legislation if the will of the House and Senate is to do it.

But the Evansville Republican maintained that such legislation doesnt do anything because judges can already consider bias in sentencing.

He said a felony is a felony no matter why you commit it, and if lawmakers start making a list of who’s protected under bias crime legislation, “there’s no end to the list.”

“We all agree that when crimes are committed out of hate for people’s unchangeable characteristics, I mean that’s just awful, he said. I think all Hoosiers agree with that. Fortunately, the law is already there.”

Gov. Eric Holcomb could play a key role in the debate if he threw his weight in one direction or the other. But whether he will do so remains unclear.

I’m working with my staff to understand exactly what current legal protections already exist under state law, he said in a statement. As I’ve previously indicated, I’ll consider recommendations from lawmakers if changes are needed. I will roll out my legislative agenda before Organization Day later this fall.

Senate President Pro Tempore David Long said he has supported the legislation in the past and would do so again.

As Taylor finished his coffee on Monday, he cast the coming debate on hate crimes as an important part of a national conversation.

We are a microcosm of this country, he said as Ruckelshaus nodded in agreement. If we want to see the country come together, we have to first show through our actions that we come together.

"On Monday May 21st, Joseph Caleca pleaded guilty to leaving the scene after causing injury in the 2014 hate crime involving Indian-American Sandeep Singh.

Singh, who wears a turban, was critically injured after Caleca called him a “terrorist” and told him “go back to your country” before running him over in his pick up truck on a public street in Queens, New York, July 30, 2014.

The truck dragged him for 30 feet and Singh was hospitalized with severe injuries.

The Sikh Coalition represented Singh and worked with law enforcement officials, his family and the Sikh community to ensure that the assailant was identified and that the attack was investigated and prosecuted as a hate crime, the organization said in a May 30 press release.

Caleca, who has been in prison for the past 17 months, was sentenced to one year already served and was released from prison based on custodial credits while awaiting trial.

“Nobody should have to go through what I have endured, but my hope is that by exposing this bigoted violence we will continue to work together to eradicate hate,” Singh is quoted saying in the press release, adding, “While I’m disappointed that the formal hate crime charge was dropped during the plea agreement, I’m relieved that there is finally closure in my case and I am deeply thankful for the Sikh Coalition’s support and relentless advocacy.”

“A hate crime enhancement is not to impose a harsher penalty, but to acknowledge that Sikhs remain targeted. The best way to combat the problem of hate in America is to have it recognized,” said Senior Staff Attorney, Julian Darwall. “While we recognize that the hate crime charge was not formally sentenced in this case, we applaud Sandeep’s courage in standing up to hate and telling his story as we continue our efforts to hold those accountable in similar cases across America,” Duvall added

In order to appear more credible, the scammers may even provide information such as a badge number and the name of an actual federal judge and courthouse address. Victims are told they can avoid arrest by paying a fine using a reloadable credit card and are urge to call a number to provide their own credit card information to initiate the process. The U.S. Marshals Service does not call anyone to arrange payment of fines over the phone for failure to appear for jury duty or any other infraction.

"Detroit firefighters got a kick in their turnout pants this weekend while fighting a fire in an area that has seen almost a dozen fires in a three-day period. Someone stole important firefighting equipment – a pair of saws valued at about $2,000 each – while the firefighters from Ladder Company 22 were battling the blaze, the Detroit Free Press reports. Firefighters use a chainsaw to breach the roofs of buildings to allow hot air and superheated gases to escape. The larger saw, known as a K-14, is used to cut open metal doors often found on commercial buildings. We parked the rig and fought the fire, Firefighter Jeremy Mullins told the Free Press. When we came back and opened the compartment, they were gone. ... It was easy pickings. Its very frustrating. Ive put in a lot of effort to get things like that for my firehouse and other firehouses to make sure they have what they need. To have them stolen, its a slap in the face. Its not the first time such a theft has occurred, according to a story on the Detroit Fire Departments legacy website. A similar theft occurred in January 2013. Firefighters had left the firehouse at 6830 McGraw briefly to grab a bite to eat at a nearby restaurant. When they returned, the chainsaw and K-12 saw were missing. The K-12 was recovered at a local flea market, but the chainsaw was never found. It was later replaced through a donation by the National Firefighters Endowment.

"PORTLAND, Ore. – The man accused of threatening a Muslim couple, days after the deadly MAX stabbing, says he did it because of fear and ignorance.

Portland police said 49-year-old Frederick Nolan Sorrell was arrested on Friday, July 7.

Bias crimes detectives investigated the incident in May, which led to an arrest warrant for Sorrell. Investigators said he made verbal threats to the couple and pointed his hand at them like a gun.

Court documents say he unlawfully, intentionally and because of his perception of the victims race, color, religion and national origin, caused alarm by threatening to inflict serious physical injury upon them.

“I yelled at them, I said, Take that off. Go back to your country if you want to wear that. Yes, I did,” Sorrell told KATU News after his court appearance Monday, adding hes never seen anyone in a burka before. Ive never seen where it’s [niqab]. I’ve seen other hijabs, colorful and I smile at them. I think they are very colorful and I don’t hate Muslims. I don’t have anything against Muslims. I was scared when I saw it.

As for the allegations that he pointed his hand to look like a gun, Sorrell said he was simply pointing.

“It was pointing, like pointing to everyone else around me who I was yelling at, cause yeah, I probably looked like a raving lunatic. I have no doubt about that,” he said.

Sorrell then admitted the only thing he knows about the Muslim faith is what he sees and reads on media and social media. When asked why he did not take an opportunity to learn about the Muslim faith Sorrell said, “because of my ignorance.”



“Everything I see in black that is causing all these inflictions [sic] in the world like ISIS, Antifa, the face covered up, the KKK with their white hoods, I would have done the same thing. You don’t do that here,” he said. “I don’t hate you people. I’m just scared of some of the things I see. Like everything black like the Grim Ripper, its affiliated with death.”

Hes also accused of threatening to cause substantial damage to the victims property. He says hes now afraid for his own life.



“If the victims want to sit down and talk. I would love to sit down and have an open conversation with them and have a very objective open mind,” said Sorrell. “[Id] apologize. I just don’t know them and all I know is fear-based information.”



A judge ordered him to not have any contact with the victims. Hes also not allowed to be on Facebook.

Sorell is no stranger to the law. Records show he was convicted of rape in Multnomah County in 2001.

"Hate crimes in New York City were stubbornly flat in 2017, sustaining almost all of 2016’s double digit election year increase and hovering about 9 percent above the decade average. Even with the slight 1.7 percent dip from 345 to 339, 2017 remains the fourth highest year for hate crime in the city since 2002, as various targeted groups like Jews, African-Americans and Muslims experienced significant increases in attacks. In contrast, crime overall in the city is down to levels not seen since the 1950s, with a 5.4 percent drop last year alone, the fourth consecutive annual decrease in a row.

New York, owing to its size, reports the most hate crimes of any city in country, but its final numbers also buck the trend of other large cities like Philadelphia; Washington, D.C., Seattle and Phoenix that are heading for significant increases, as those places await completed tallies. Previously, hate crimes in the city rose 12.4 percent in 2016; much more than the 4.6 percent national rise, propelled by a massive spike in the weeks following the presidential election. For the nation as a whole, the election time fourth quarter of 2016 saw a 26 percent spike from the previous year and had the highest number of hate crimes since 2008. New York City also experienced a precipitous increase following election day 2016.

Over two thirds of hate crimes last year in the city were almost evenly split between Brooklyn, the most populated borough and Manhattan, the most crowded. About 60 percent of New York City hate crime in 2017 targeted religion, as anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim hate crimes rose by double digits. The most frequent targets for hate crime in New York in 2017 were Jews, Gays, Muslims, and African-Americans, with all except Gays experiencing large increases. In comparison, the five most frequently targeted groups nationally were African-Americans, Gays, Whites, Jews and Latinos in 2016. About two in three 2017 New York hate crimes were property damage or harassment, while around 20 percent were assaults.

Anti-Semitic & Anti-Muslim Cases Hit Multi-Year Highs And Account for Over Half of All NYC Hate Crime

The 150 anti-Semitic hate crimes in 2017 accounted for 44 percent of the city’s overall annual tally, despite the fact that Jews account for only 18 percent of the city’s population. Anti-Semitic hate crime rose ten percent in 2017, for the third straight annual increase. New York City, home to more than 1.5 million Jews, has the largest concentration of them of any city in the world, with slightly over one quarter of American Jews residing in New York State alone. Of the nation’s largest cities with 2017 breakdowns, Jews were consistently among the top three most targeted groups, and they topped preliminary tallies in Chicago and in Philadelphia as well, where they were tied with African-Americans.

In 2016, the latest year with national police data, anti-Semitic hate crimes rose three percent and twenty percent of those crimes occurred just in New York City according to the FBI. Jews accounted for 11 percent of all hate crimes nationally and slightly over half of all religious based hate crime in 2016. Jews constitute only about two percent of the American population. Anti-Jewish hate crimes are down nationally over the last decade, but have seen an upsurge more recently. A wave of over 150 bomb threats mostly emanating from Israel early last year contributed to increases in many places. Even as groups like the Anti-Defamation League have shown increases in anti-Semitic “incidents,” including non-criminal ones, in their data over recent periods, they also show a decrease in assaults and shifts of bigotry to the Internet.

Hate crimes against Muslims in New York City rose as well, further reflecting a national trend of an increase in religious hate crime. Anti-Muslim hate crime rose 16 percent in the city, from 31 to 36 incidents, the second consecutive increase. Nationally anti-Muslim hate crimes almost doubled from 2014 to 2016 according to the FBI, as both assaults, and their proportion of victims surged, though numerically anti-Semitic hate crime is still the most prevalent type of faith-based hate crime. In 2016, Muslims constituted 5 percent of all hate crime victims in the U.S., but in New York in 2017, they were the third most frequent target at 11 percent of all hate crimes citywide. Reflecting a trend seen in many major cities, hate crimes were three times as likely to be committed on the basis of religion in New York, as they were in the nation as a whole as religion-based attacks become more common.

Non-Religion Hate Crime

The Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual community were the second most frequently targeted group last year with 45 incidents, or 13 percent of the total despite a significant decline of 41 percent from the previous year. Anti-African-American attacks rose from 18 to 33, after experiencing a similar decline the previous year. The city’s sole hate homicide was the horrific March sword slashing murder of a 66 year old African-American man, Timothy Caughman, who was randomly attacked in Manhattan by a Maryland white supremacist.

While it’s too early to forecast what the precise national trend for 2017 will be, one thing is certain, in many of the nation’s largest cities like New York, hate crimes remain elevated with Jews, Gays, Blacks and Muslims being the most frequent target as hate crimes.

"The four young men accused of attacking a gay couple on South Beach face stiffer penalties after prosecutors charged them Thursday under Floridas hate-crime enhancement law.

The group was charged with aggravated battery committed with prejudice, which means each could face up to 30 years in prison if convicted of the attack that took place during Miami Beachs annual gay-pride parade.

Police say the attack happened in April after one of the victims accidentally bumped into 21-year-old Juan Carlos Lopez near a bathroom area near Ocean Drive and Sixth Street.

Lopez and his companions, Luis M. Alonso Piovet, 20; Adonis Diaz, 21; and Pablo Reinaldo Romo-Figueroa, 21, began to call the victims maricones, an anti-gay slur in Spanish, police said.

"A hate crimes bill that enhances prison sentences for criminals who physically assault LGBT people – and protects several other classes of people – received a hearing in the Georgia House on Monday.

The measure – House Bill 663 from state Rep. Karen Bennett – was vetted during an hour-long hearing before a subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee. The bill from the Stone Mountain Democrat is one of three hate crimes bills before lawmakers. Senate Bill 316 is a companion bill and was introduced along with it by the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus in early January. The third, House Bill 660, was introduced on Jan. 4 by state Rep. Meagan Hanson, a Brookhaven Republican.

One of the motivations that we have in this bill is that it sends a message that no crime is acceptable. However, if youre going to go after our citizens because of differences and because of hate that you host in your heart and target certain individuals, we want to send the message that Georgia is not going to tolerate it and because of that we want to impose higher enhanced penalties, Bennett (top photo) said during the hearing.

The bill – sponsored by state Reps. Calvin Smyre, Sandra Scott, Carolyn Hugley, James Beverly and William Boddie, all Democrats – spells out longer sentences for crimes targeting people based on race, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin and physical disability. It provides for enhanced sentencing for simple assault, aggravated assault, simple battery, battery, aggravated battery and criminal damage to property in the first and second degree.

Bennett said the bill provides additional tools to prosecutors to persecute criminals that provide offenses in this area.

No doubt that these types of criminals and offenses occur but without a law on the books, they are limited in terms of the power and authority they have to actually persecute individuals based on a hate crime, Bennett said.

Jeff Graham, executive director of Georgia Equality, said the legislation would help local law enforcement agencies across Georgia better report woefully inadequate data about hate crimes. Currently, law enforcement agencies are not required to track hate crimes or report them to the FBI as they must do for other crimes.

Passing LGBT inclusive hate crime legislation is an important step in the right direction in terms of protecting all Georgians from violence and ensuring that our states reputation as a good place to visit, live and do business remains intact, Graham said.

Opportunity to begin punishing Christians

Religious conservatives spokes out against the legislation, airing concerns that it could be used to turn their anti-LGBT views into crimes.

The focus of crime legislation needs to be on the act itself and not on criminalizing beliefs. You see hate crimes legislation seeks to criminalize beliefs as well as actions, creating in essence a form of thought crime, said Mike Griffin, a lobbyist for the Georgia Baptist Mission Board.

It eventually ends up being an opportunity for individuals to begin punishing Christians who just simply may just peaceably be able to voice their moral opposition to various sexual behaviors not in any way intended to harm anyone whatsoever. Just being able to express ones biblical beliefs can eventually, were concerned, that ends up being hate and it has been said that thats what it is and its not, Griffin added.

Tanya Ditty (second photo), state director of Concerned Women for America, said the bill would create a multi-tiered system of justice that highlights government preferred victims.

While the bill might look good on the surface because nobody likes hate crimes, it does violate the Constitutional concept of equal protection under the law, Ditty said.

When considering H.B. 663, I do believe that it plays into the false narrative that there is a hate crimes epidemic. The data does not support this claim, she added.

Paul Smith – the founder of Citizen Impact, which advocates for religious freedom legislation and against same-sex marriage – also argued that the legislation could be used to silence anti-LGBT pastors.

We believe that hate crimes legislation could, even though it is well intentioned, could be used to intimidate pastors, pastors who believe the biblical position on homosexuality and other things, intimidated from preaching from Romans Chapter 1, or other types of messages – that the long arm of the law and the heavy hand of the government could be used to silence and intimidate pastors, Smith said.

Georgia is one five states in the U.S. without a hate crimes bill.

In 2004, the Georgia Supreme Court dumped the states hate crime law. The measure called for enhanced prison sentences for crimes sparked by bias or prejudice. The court tossed out the law, calling it unconstitutionally vague because it did not include specific categories, such as sexual orientation. Lawmakers stripped out the categories before passing the measure in 2000.

Former Sen. Vincent Fort, who sponsored the original legislation, later tried and failed to pass another hate crime measure in 2007. Fort joined with Sen. Nan Orrock and former Mayor Kasim Reed – then a state senator – to propose the bill on the 10th anniversary of the Otherside bombing. The Midtown gay bar was bombed by Eric Robert Rudolph on Feb. 21, 1997.",1

"Students, faculty discuss hate crime prevention after swastika found in Simmons

Suggestions include mandatory diversity training for student leaders, collaboration between political clubs

Simmons residents found a swastika drawn in chalk on a fifth floor hallway wall Oct. 25. MIT campus police classified the incident as a hate crime, according to an email from Head of House Ellen Essigmann to residents.

In response, Vice President and Dean for Student Life Suzy Nelson hosted an event open to the entire MIT community Nov. 3 called Standing up for One MIT. The purpose of the event was to discuss “ways we can ensure our residence halls, classrooms, and community spaces are places that celebrate kindness, understanding, and respect,” according to an email that Nelson sent to the student body.

After Simmons residents reported the swastika to the Simmons House Team and Area Director Kristen Shannon, the Bias Response Team (BRT) conducted an initial assessment and coordinated a response plan. Simmons Head of House John Essigmann informed all residents of the incident in an email the same day. Rabbi Michelle Fisher SM ’97 also emailed the Simmons Jewish residents separately, according to Nelson.

In a follow-up email that Ellen Essigmann sent to all residents Oct. 27, she invited residents to a community open house that took place later that day. “A few members of the House Team will be there to listen, to support, and to provide information on where to go to receive additional help,” Essigmann wrote in her email.

The MIT police determined that a “timely warning” notice was not necessary. “It has to reach a certain threshold to become a community-wide alert,” Nelson said in a phone interview with The Tech.

Nelson emailed the Undergraduate Association (UA), Dormitory Council (DormCon), and Graduate Student Council (GSC) leadership a draft of her email about the Standing up for One MIT event Oct. 31. She asked them to revise it and individually sign their names. “I thought it would have far more impact if it were a broader message from the student leaders and me,” Nelson said.

UA, DormCon, and GSC leaders were present at the event, where they discussed ideas for combatting hate crimes on campus.

DormCon President Yuge Ji ’18 suggested mandating diversity and inclusion training as requirements for student leaders, like those in the UA. Ji later toldThe Tech that she only would support highly encouraged, rather than mandatory, training.

“It’s difficult to see how important the training is until after you do it,” she said. “It’s especially important for student leaders, who are the ones making decisions and communicating with the student body.”

UA President Sarah Melvin ’18 agreed with the idea of training for all student leaders. The UA had previously brought MIT’s diversity and inclusion officer Judy “JJ” Jackson to give a talk during their fall retreat, Melvin said in an interview with The Tech.

Melvin also thought that more academic programs could advocate for diversity and inclusion, such as “a HASS elective focused on learning about different cultures, or a freshman seminar in order to have more dialogue with peers about identity.”

UA Vice President Alexa Martin ’19 proposed collaboration among the political clubs. “There’s room for political clubs to work with each other to create events where students are able to talk openly and understand each other’s views better,” Martin said in a phone interview with The Tech.

The administration has already taken steps to promote diversity and inclusion. The Academic Council Working Group on Community and Inclusion was formed in December 2015 in response to the sets of recommendations that the Black Students’ Union and Black Graduate Students’ Association published addressing racial and mental health issues.

Based on the recommendations, the administration implemented a two-hour diversity program during Freshman Orientation week starting in fall 2016. The Division of Student Life, libraries, and all departments also each developed mission statements about diversity, according to Nelson.

Nelson plans to reach out to more students through their living groups. “Even at study breaks, there can be meaningful conversations that bring these issues of bias and prejudice to the broader community,” Nelson said. “This is the responsibility of all of us, not one office. We all have to take the responsibility for change on an individual and collective level.”",1

"Indifference is ‘Dangerously Contagious Virus’ that Is the Root of Hatred

by Pope Francis

Descriptive Title Pope Francis Address to International Conference on Responsibility of All in Fight Against Anti-Semitism Description Pope Francis met with the participants in the International Conference on the responsibility of states, institutions and individuals in the fight against anti-Semitism and anti-Semitic hate crimes on January 29, 2018, in the Vatican. The conference, held in Rome at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, was organized in cooperation with OSCE, with the support of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) and in collaboration with the Union of Italian Jewish Communities and the Foundation Contemporary Jewish Documentation Center. Publisher & Date Vatican, January 29, 2018

Dear friends,

I offer you a warm welcome and thank you for your presence here. I am grateful for the noble aim that brings you here: to reflect together, from varying points of view, on the responsibility of States, institutions and individuals in the struggle against anti-Semitism and crimes associated with anti-Semitic hatred. I would like to emphasize one word: responsibility. We are responsible when we are able to respond. It is not merely a question of analyzing the causes of violence and refuting their perverse reasoning, but of being actively prepared to respond to them. Thus, the enemy against which we fight is not only hatred in all of its forms, but even more fundamentally, indifference; for it is indifference that paralyzes and impedes us from doing what is right even when we know that it is right.

I do not grow tired of repeating that indifference is a virus that is dangerously contagious in our time, a time when we are ever more connected with others, but are increasingly less attentive to others. And yet the global context should help us understand that none of us is an island and none will have a future of peace without one that is worthy for all. The Book of Genesis helps us to understand that indifference is an insidious evil crouching at man’s door (cf. Gen 4:7). It is the subject of debate between the creature and his Creator at the beginning of history, as soon as the Creator asks Cain: “Where is your brother?” But Cain, who has just killed his brother, does not reply to the question, does not explain “where”. On the contrary, he protests that he is autonomous: “Am I my brother’s keeper?” (v. 9). His brother does not interest him: here is the root of perversity, the root of death that produces desperation and silence. I recall the roar of the deafening silence I sensed two years ago in Auschwitz-Birkenau: a disturbing silence that leaves space only for tears, for prayer and for the begging of forgiveness.

Faced with the virus of indifference, the root of hatred, what vaccine can we administer? The Book of Deuteronomy comes to our aid. After a long journey through the desert, Moses addressed a basic counsel to the Chosen People: “Remember your whole journey” (Deut 8:2). To the people longing for the promised future, wisdom was suggesting one looks back, turning one’s glance to the steps already completed. And Moses did not simply say, “think of the journey”, but remember, or bring alive; do not let the past die. Remember, that is, “return with your heart”: do not only form the memory in your mind, but in the depths of your soul, with your whole being. And do not form a memory only of what you like, but of “your whole journey”. We have just celebrated International Holocaust Remembrance Day. In order to recover our humanity, to recover our human understanding of reality and to overcome so many deplorable forms of apathy towards our neighbour, we need this memory, this capacity to involve ourselves together in remembering. Memory is the key to accessing the future, and it is our responsibility to hand it on in a dignified way to young generations.

In this regard, I would like to mention a document of the Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews, whose twentieth anniversary of publication we celebrate this year. The title is eloquent: We Remember: a Reflection on the Shoah (16 March 1998). It was Saint John Paul II’s fervent hope that it “would enable memory to play its necessary part in the process of shaping a future in which the unspeakable iniquity of the Shoah will never again be possible” (Letter, 12 March 1998). The text speaks of this memory, which we Christians are called to safeguard, together with our elder Jewish brothers: “However, it is not only a question of recalling the past. The common future of Jews and Christians demands that we remember, for ‘there is no future without memory’. History itself is memoria futuri” (We Remember, I).

To build our history, which will either be together or will not be at all, we need a common memory, living and faithful, that should not remain imprisoned in resentment but, though riven by the night of pain, should open up to the hope of a new dawn. The Church desires to extend her hand. She wishes to remember and to walk together. On this journey, “the Church, mindful of the patrimony she shares with the Jews and moved not by political reasons but by the Gospel’s spiritual love, decries hatred, persecutions, displays of anti-Semitism, directed against Jews at any time and by anyone” (Nostra Aetate, 4).

Dear friends, may we help one another in turn to grow a culture of responsibility, of memory and of closeness, and to establish an alliance against indifference, against every form of indifference. The potentialities of information will certainly be of assistance; even more important will be those of formation. We need urgently to educate young generations to become actively involved in the struggle against hatred and discrimination, but also in the overcoming of conflicting positions in the past, and never to grow tired of seeking the other. Indeed, to prepare a truly human future, rejecting evil is not enough; we need to build the common good together.

I thank you for your commitment in all of these matters. May the Lord of peace accompany you and bless every one of your good intentions. Thank you.

"NASHVILLE, TN — A Murfreesboro man is facing up to five years in prison after confessing in federal court Friday that he received disability payments from the U.S. Veterans Affairs (VA) Department while working at a full-time job. Edmond Deslatte, 46, a Navy veteran, pleaded guilty to making a false statement to a federal agent in connection with an investigation into his disability benefits, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Middle District of Tennessee. Deslatte received about $148,000 in disability payments under false pretenses, the U.S. Attorneys Office said in a statement. In the plea hearing Friday before U.S. District Court Judge Aleta Trauger, Deslatte admitted that he made a false statement during an April 2011 interview with a special agent with the VAs Office of Inspector General, the federal prosecutors said in the statement. At the time, he was receiving 100% disability benefit payments from the VA, although he had been working full-time. Deslatte said he falsely told the VA agent that a medication prescribed for his medical condition had rendered him disabled and unable to work. He also admitted that he had not been taking the medication, as he had told the agent, the prosecutors said. Deslatte said in court that he misled the agent in an effort to keep receiving disability payments from the VA. But in May 2014, a VA physician determined that Deslatte did not suffer from the medical condition that had supposedly rendered him disabled, and the VA subsequently terminated Deslattes disability payments, the prosecutors said. Along with a possible prison sentence, Deslatte faces a fine of up to $250,000. He is scheduled to be sentenced by Trauger on Jan. 19.",0

"(NBC News) The Chicago man seen in a viral video berating a woman for wearing a shirt bearing the Puerto Rican flag has been charged with felony hate crimes.



Cook County States Attorney spokeswoman Tandra Simonton said Friday Timothy Trybus, 62, is charged with two counts of felony hate crime.



Video shot on June 24 shows Trybus repeatedly yelling at 24-year-old Mia Irizarry for wearing a Puerto Rican flag shirt, asking if shes a U.S. citizen and saying youre not going to change us, you know that? and the world is not going to change the United States of America.



Puerto Rico is, in fact, part of the United States and Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens.



The video showed a responding police officer doing little to stop Trybus or remove him from the picnic shelter, reserved by Irizarry, where the confrontation occurred. That officer has since resigned.

"× Harris County DA charges white man with hate crime: “I hate n—– and I’m gonna kill me one today”

HARRIS COUNTY, Texas — The Harris County District Attorney’s Office has accused a white resident of committing a hate crime against a black man. It is possible the suspect is mentally unstable or has a “deep-seated animosity toward African-Americans,” prosecutors said in a release.

James Scott Lee II, 32, was scheduled to go before a Harris County judge Thursday morning to face an aggravated assault with a deadly weapon charge, but he did not appear because he is undergoing a psychiatric evaluation.

“It can be difficult to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a person is motivated by racial hatred, but in this case, the defendant’s own words supply the evidence to charge him with a hate crime,” First Assistant District Attorney Tom Berg said.

The suspect attacked the victim both verbally and physically Wednesday by allegedly unleashing a racial epithet while trying to stab the man, prosecutors said. Officers said Lee also in possession of brass knuckles at the time of his arrest.

“I hate n—– and I’m gonna kill me one today,” Lee was quoted as saying during the attack in a court document. Prosecutors said the victim escaped his alleged attacker by jumping into a car and locking the door.

Prosecutors said Lee has a history of violence, having been convicted of domestic assault and violation of a protective order.

Investigators said Lee, who authorities identified as white, chose his victim based on race. In response, the office said it has added “a rarely used hate crimes enhancement” to the charge.

Prosecutors have requested Lee be held on $250,000 bail, which is more than eight times the normal amount for an aggravated assault case.

If convicted, Lee could face five years to life in prison, instead of two to 20 years.",1

(JTA) — A former police commissioner in France called for a probe of three officers for failing to save a Jewish woman who was killed by a Muslim man in her home while they were waiting for backup outside her Paris apartment.

Sammy Ghozlan, a retired commissioner and head of the National Bureau for Vigilance Against Anti-Semitism watchdog group, told officials and family members of the victim, Sarah Halimi, that an internal review was necessary.

French Jewish leaders criticized authorities’ handling of the investigation into the killing of Halimi by her neighbor, whom neighbors said had called her “Satan” and shouted “Allahu akbar” before throwing her to her death from her third-story window.

The suspect, Kobili Traore, was placed under psychiatric evaluation as per his temporary insanity claim though he has no history of mental illness.

A draft indictment against him published by the Paris Prosecutor’s office did not mention a hate crime, prompting the CRIF umbrella group of French Jews to criticize the judiciary and what CRIF said was indifference by the media.

During the attack, three armed police officers arrived at the apartment before Halimi’s defenestration but decided against breaking into the apartment while waiting for backup, an investigation by BNVCA revealed, Ghozlan said.

“The police officers’ conduct suggests they had suspected a terrorist attack in progress, rather than a neighborly dispute,” Ghozlan said. “If this is the case, and there is reason to believe the attack was terrorist in nature, than this case is not being treated accordingly. It is very unusual,” he added.

Ghozlan also said he feared that the officers may have refrained from taking action for fear of triggering violence or other forms of unrest through an altercation with a Muslim suspect, a scenario which in 2006 prompted riots across France, featuring the burning of cars and buildings.",1
"In-depth news and talking heads waltzed over country music to lead the Chico radio market last fall.

Northstate Public Radio (KCHO-FM 91.7) and KPAY-AM 1290 tied for first in the share of total listeners, based on Arbitron Inc.’s ratings for fall 2005.

For the past year, country music ruled the highly segmented radio roost in the twice-yearly surveys.

The Blaze (KHSL-FM 103.5) was king in the spring but shared third place with Club 967 (KZAP-FM 96.7) in the fall. Country station KALF-FM 95.7 was first in fall 2004 but came in fourth last quarter.

Joe Oleksiewicz, KCHO’s program director, said the high placement is good news which he attributes to the station’s lineup. He noted that “Morning Edition” is the station’s best-ranked program, often ranking at or near the top compared to other morning programs.

“I’m impressed that the overall numbers are so good,” he said.

Northstate Public Radio is operated by Chico State University.

Noncommercial radio ratings aren’t listed alongside commercial stations but the data is the same, according to Arbitron spokeswoman Jessica Benbow. She said Arbitron provides commercial data to be used to help sell advertising. Noncommercial radio data is licensed to the Radio Research Consortium.

Benbow said many public radio stations appear to have a high market share, but didn’t have firm information.

“I believe it happens often,” she said.

KCHO’s No. 1 position appears to be unique among many Northern California radio markets although San Francisco’s KQED-FM 88.5 is the second-highest rated station in its market.

Chico community station KZFR-FM 90.1 ranks ninth. In Redding, KCHO’s sister station KFPR-FM 88.9 checks in at eighth. Capital Public Radio in Sacramento has two stations — KXPR-FM 88.9 and KXPR-FM 90.9 — which rank 11th and 12th there.

Nationally, KCHO is 16th on the consortium’s top 30 ranking of public radio stations based on their hold of the local market. Only one California public radio station — KCBX-FM 90.1 in San Luis Obisbo — has a larger piece of its local market.

The commercial news-talk format appears to fare better in San Francisco and Sacramento with KGO-AM 810 and KFBK-AM 1530 topping their respective cities’ charts.

Dino Corbin, general manager and co-owner of Deer Creek Broadcasting, said it’s great to have No. 1 bragging rights, but stations look at more specific data to target advertisers. Deer Creek owns KPAY, The Blaze and four other stations in Chico.

“Although that’s a nice fun thing, that doesn’t mean anything in our world,” Corbin said.

Arbitron’s publicly available data reports listeners older than 12 years who listen to the radio some time between 6 a.m. and midnight everyday. Radio stations pay Arbitron for more specific information breaking the numbers down based on certain time periods and a listener’s age and buying habits.

“Ratings — you can slice the bologna a lot of different ways,” Corbin said.

Looking at KHSL’s decline, Corbin said ratings for specific radio stations can swing from season to season. He said the station’s drop isn’t as great in its key demographic and it remains very highly ranked for women ages 18 to 49.

Corbin said Arbitron will begin averaging the ratings between two different periods to provide a more accurate picture. Arbitron collects its data by having people record their listening in diaries. The number of diaries and survey frequency depends on the market’s size. Arbitron collected 544 diaries in its twice-annual survey of Chico, the nation’s 199th largest radio market.

“The sample that we have is reflective of the population in that particular market,” Benbow said.

Although KPAY competes with Northstate Public Radio for a share of total listeners, Corbin said KPAY’s offerings of conservative talk shows don’t directly face-off with Northstate Public Radio’s mix of news and classical music.

KCHO can’t publicly compare its ratings to others, but Oleksiewicz is able to determine that younger, male listeners tend to listen to KCHO’s news programming while older, female listeners tend to skew towards classical music. In addition to “Morning Edition,” weekend fare such as “Car Talk” and “A Prairie Home Companion” are also popular.

Northstate Public Radio uses its ratings alongside pledge drives and listener feedback to determine how its programming is doing. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting and others use the ratings to determine KCHO’s level of funding.

“It’s part of the mix,” Oleksiewicz said.

"CLEARLAKE (AP) — A California man is facing hate crime and other charges after police say he stabbed a black man with a machete after yelling racial slurs over the holiday weekend.

Police in Clearlake, about 80 miles (128 kilometers) north of San Francisco, say they responded to an apartment complex Saturday night after people reported someone yelling racial slurs in the parking lot and later attacking the victim with the knife.

Police say the 34-year-old suspect, Anthony Hammond, went back into his apartment and an hours-long standoff began. He eventually came out of the apartment and was arrested.

In addition to a hate crime count, Hammond is charged with aggravated mayhem, battery and assault. He’s being held on more than $1 million bond.

Attorney information for Hammond couldn’t be located online.

"MARTINEZ — Moments before they were sentenced to prison for beating and stabbing a Sikh man while cutting off his hair, two Texas residents heard from their victim.

Maan Singh Khalsa, 41, stood at a podium a few feet away from his attackers, Colton Leblanc and Chase Little, who listened from inside a courthouse bullpen. Khalsa spoke of the physical and emotional trauma he suffered.

The Richmond resident was attacked by three men at a Richmond intersection on Sept. 25.

Khalsa was stabbed in the hand so deeply that his finger needed to be amputated, and his eye was swollen shut from the beating. Having his turban yanked off and hair cut was “humiliating,” he said. Later, he encouraged his attackers to learn about other cultures.

“I still consider you my brothers as human beings,” Khalsa said. “I hope one day you will consider me your brother too.”

Leblanc and Little, who are cousins, pleaded no contest Thursday to charges of felony assault with a hate crime enhancement, each receiving a sentence of three years in state prison as part of a plea deal. The hearing brings to a close a case that received national attention, both due to the brutal nature of the attack and the fact that prosecutors said from the beginning that Khalsa had been targeted because of his faith; authorities have speculated the two mistook his turban as a sign that he was a Muslim.

“It will take many years, maybe the rest of my life, to heal from this attack,” Khalsa said. “Just recognizing it as a hate crime is the first step in healing for me.”

Though sentenced to three years, Little and Leblanc could be released in about 18 months with good behavior. Both were given about 50 days credit for time served. They did not speak, other than saying “yes, your honor” when asked if they accepted the terms of the plea.

Ironically, the day Khalsa was attacked, he had spent the day helping raise money for a local nonprofit that educates the public about the Sikh faith, according to testimony. When he stopped at a traffic light, he felt a thud, and turned to look. Someone in a pickup truck next to him had thrown an empty beer can into his car.

Khalsa testified that he got out of his car and tossed the can back, telling the car’s occupants, “I think you forgot something.” Little became enraged and started screaming at Khalsa through an open window while the car’s other occupants held him back, one of the truck’s occupants testified.

After following him to another intersection, Little and Leblanc punched him 10-15 times through an open window, pulled his hair out of the car, and began to hack at it with a knife while screaming “Cut his (expletive) hair,” Khalsa testified at the preliminary hearing. When he put his hand out to stop them, his pinky finger was cut so badly that doctors were forced to amputate the digit.

The attack sparked national outrage, but also greatly affected the local Sikh community, said Satinder Malhi, a Sikh parishioner who attended Thursday’s hearing.

“This has also impacted me personally; I’m a proud practicing member of the Sikh faith and if this could happen to him it could happen to me,” Malhi said. “Unfortunately, hate crimes are nothing new to the Sikh-American community.”

Sikh-Americans often are inadvertent victims of Islamophobia, and the first homicidal hate crime that followed the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks targeted a Sikh man. A group called the Sikh Coalition, which rallied around Khalsa’s case, estimates that about 99 percent of U.S. residents who wear turbans in public are Sikh.

“Whether they were mistaken about his nationality or religion is immaterial. They perceived him as being non-Western, of a different faith, and therefore continued to target him in a far more aggressive, egregious fashion than what is already considered reprehensible conduct,” prosecutor Simon O’Connell said.",1
"Samuel Woodward is charged with murder in the killing 19-year-old Blaze Bernstein, a University of Pennsylvania student who went missing this month while visiting his family in Orange County. Prosecutors say Woodward stabbed Bernstein 20 times and then buried his body in a Lake Forest park, where it was found days later.

Bernstein was Jewish and gay, and police are investigating his killing as a possible hate crime.

Woodward is scheduled to be arraigned in Orange County Superior Court on Friday.

Relying on “three people with detailed knowledge of Woodward’s recent past,” the investigative news website ProPublica said Woodward was a member of the group Atomwaffen — which has been tied to other killings and a bomb plot in recent months — and traveled to Texas to attend the group’s three-day training camp.

Group members at the camp were trained in firearms and hand-to-hand combat, a former Atomwaffen member told ProPublica. The individual, who watched Woodward shoot at the camp, described him as skilled in handling handguns and assault rifles. ProPublica said it obtained photos of Woodward and other group members “making straight-armed Nazi salutes while wearing skull masks.”

Atomwaffen’s commitment to violence makes it more dangerous than other groups that have emerged from the recent wave of white supremacists, according to experts on right-wing extremism quoted by the news site. And unlike other new white nationalist groups, Atomwaffen embraces Nazi imagery and openly celebrates Adolf Hitler and Charles Manson.

The group was estimated to have about 80 members, but its ranks have grown since the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Va., last year, the former member told ProPublica.

"Egyptian immigrant Mohamed Ali Abdelmoatty Kenawy, who was attacked three weeks ago in what appeared to be a hate crime, works at his food stand in Rios Copacabana neighborhood (AFP Photo/Apu Gomes)

When video went viral of a racist attack on a Muslim street food vendor in Rio de Janeiro, Brazilians wondered gloomily: had their country also been swept up in a global wave of xenophobia?

The answer — a flood of love transforming the humble vendor into a folk hero and, on Thursday, the recipient of a Rio state award — was a heartwarming no.

SPONSORED

But the truth may be a little more complicated.

It all began August 3 when Mohamed Ali Abdelmoatty Kenawy, 33, was manning the cart from which he sells Arab-style meat pies and hummus in the thronging center of Copacabana.

Suddenly a thick-set, bald man carrying two sticks appeared, screaming at Kenawy, who came to Brazil three years ago and has since become universally known as “the Syrian refugee.”

“Get out of my country!” yelled the assailant. “I’m a Brazilian and my country is being invaded by these miserable human bombs who kill children!”

Thin, with neat dark hair and glasses, Kenawy did not attempt to fight back, merely picking up food that had been spilled when his cart came under attack.

The incident might have got even uglier, except that among the growing number of bystanders was 19-year-old Beatriz Bastos de Souza, who intervened, and then began filming on her mobile phone.

“The man started to kick the cart and then started to kick and punch Mohamed,” she said Thursday. “There were three or four of them, not just one, and I went into the middle saying, ‘Please stop.”

Deeply depressed, Kenawy avoided work for the next two days. “That man didn’t break my cart,” he told AFP. “He broke my happiness.”

Bastos de Souza, however, left determined to do something.

After Kenawy refused her pleas for him to file a police complaint, she showed officers her video of the fracas.

“They said, ‘Delete it, nothing will come of it,” she explained.

So Bastos de Souza, who works in a travel agency, sent the video to Brazil’s biggest news organization, Globo.

They also didn’t respond. But the video made it to a smaller news outfit and all of a sudden, “my video was everywhere,” she said.

The effect was extraordinary.

Soon Kenawy was doing a sit-down interview on Globo. Thousands of people organized on Facebook to buy his pies and Rio Mayor Marcelo Crivella personally handed him a hard-to-get vendors’ license.

On Thursday, Rio state legislature voted to make Kenawy an honorary citizen.

“I knew Brazilians were kind, but after this, wow,” Kenawy said in amazement. “I can’t express my feelings.”

– ‘Different Brazils’ –

Kenawy has now become a byword in the Brazilian media for tolerance — the Syrian war survivor who, when confronted with violence, declined to strike back.

“He displayed the desire for peace and prosperity that is shared by all those seeking refuge in Brazil,” said Rio state lawmaker Wanderson Nogueira, who sponsored the municipal honor for Kenawy.

Barely five minutes go by at Kenawy’s Copacabana corner without passersby or drivers shouting out “Congratulations, Mohamed!” or stopping to pose for a photo.

But for starters, Kenawy is not a refugee from Syria.

Although his family has Syrian roots, he is an Egyptian citizen and moved in search of a better economic future when his restaurant had to close.

In Brazil, he didn’t even apply for asylum, instead obtaining a permanent residency card after marrying a local woman with whom he now has a three-month-old son.

“I wasn’t in a war,” he said.

What he is, is an archetypal poor, hard-working, ambitious immigrant.

In Rio, he started selling pies from a tiny table, then the cart.

Now he dreams of a food truck.

The anti-Muslim assault may not necessarily have been exactly what it appeared to be either.

Although brutal and racist in nature, the motive may have been more to do with a turf struggle between street vendors, according to local media.

Bastos de Souza said Kenawy had upset a smalltime “mafia.”

And one of the many people milling around Kenawy’s cart said it was unfair that the newcomer had taken a corner previously held by locals.

“The Brazilians get thrown out, is that fair?” asked the man, who did not want to be identified.

But whatever the details, the Egyptian’s fairy tale story has delighted Brazilians.

Buffeted by recession, bloody crime and corruption, they’re glad to be reminded of their better angels.

“I think what happened was a portrait of the different Brazils — the welcoming Brazil and the prejudiced Brazil,” said singer Juli Mariano, 50, who demonstrated support by buying a pie Thursday.

“And I think the welcoming version won.”",1

"There were more than 940 reports of potential bias incidents involving the targeting of Muslims between April and June, according to a report released by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) on Monday. Of those, the organization determined 451 stemmed from anti-Muslim bias, which contributed to a 91 percent increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes during the first half of the year as compared to the same time period in 2016.

Nonviolent and nonthreatening instances of harassment accounted for 16 percent of the incidents involving Muslims between April 1 and June 30, while outright hate crimes—in which violence or a physical altercation was involved—accounted for 15 percent. Incidents in which Muslims were inappropriately targeted by the FBI made up 12 percent of cases.

People were targeted at their places of residence in 17 percent of the reports, while 14 percent involved Muslim who were on walking the streets or driving their cars. Another 13 percent faced anti-Muslim bias while flying or traveling by bus or train. About 33 percent of incidents took place at a mosque or Islamic center, and 9 percent occurred at schools.

Of the incidents reported, CAIR identified triggering factors for 358, including a victim’s ethnicity or national origin—32 percent—and preconceived notions of a victim being a Muslim—20 percent. Fifteen percent of incidents were triggered by the presence of a headscarf or hijab. Forty-six percent of the people targeted were from Middle Eastern and North African countries.

Of the number of crimes identified to be based on anti-Muslim bias, the CAIR report said 126 had been investigated by federal agencies between April 1 and June 30.

Although the CAIR report did not cite President Donald Trump’s rhetoric toward Muslims as a factor in the increased anti-Muslim bias in the U.S., a previous report conducted by researchers at California State University’s Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism found that bias crimes against various minorities and religious groups were up some 20 percent since Trump’s election win in November. The majority of the crimes documented were against Muslims and individuals recognized as belonging to the LGBT community.

On multiple occasions during his campaign, Trump made harsh statements regarding “Islamic terrorists” and promoted a stronger vetting system to identify immigrants with “ties to radical ideology.”

"BROOKLINE, MA — The decomposing body of a 67-year-old woman has been found in a cluttered Brookline home, the Norfolk County District Attorney confirmed to WHDH 7News. The station reports two sisters lived together in the home on Clinton Street, and that after one died, the other sister apparently continued to live in the house with the body. Brookline Police told WHDH foul play is not suspected, and that they were notified when a relative visited the home and found the body. Read the full story from WHDH. Image via Shutterstock",0
"The New York Times front page Monday featured a beautiful and powerful story — as one top journalist described it — on the 20th anniversary of James Byrd Jr.s racially motivated dragging death in the East Texas town of Jasper.

Emotional and compelling, the piece is expertly written and filled with riveting details.

It even contains several references to faith.

So why am I about to give this story — which I mostly liked and really hoped I could praise — a negative critique? The simple answer is that the Times, in an otherwise excellent piece of journalism, fails to answer basic questions tied to religion.

Up high in the story, the newspaper hints strongly at a religion angle when it mentions church and notes that Byrds family forgave his killers:

JASPER, Tex. — Sometime after church but before dinner, Sgt. James Carter of the Jasper County Sheriff’s Office knocked on the front door of James and Stella Byrd’s home. He stepped into the living room, removed his white cowboy hat and bowed his head. Then, with a somber look on his face that the Byrds still remember years later, he delivered the news that their son James Byrd Jr. was dead.

The horrific circumstances surrounding his death they would learn later: Chained by his ankles to a pickup truck by three men, he had been dragged three miles, murdered before the sun rose that Sunday morning 20 years ago.

“I just knew something was terribly wrong,” Betty Boatner, 63, one of Mr. Byrd’s younger sisters, whispered as she sat on a picnic bench at a memorial park now named in his honor. “It’s such a small town that we had already heard the rumors that a black man was found dead, but we didn’t know who it was. Until the knock on our door.”

The family forgave Mr. Byrd’s three killers long ago and made peace with Jasper, the small East Texas town where they have lived for three generations. But as the nation faces a spread in bias crime incidents, the family wants to ensure the public remembers one of the worst hate crimes of the 20th century. In the years since Mr. Byrd’s death, both state and federal hate crime laws bear his name.

As I kept reading, I expected — or at least hoped — that the Times would elaborate on the familys forgiveness of the killers and the reasoning, which I suspected would include religion, behind it. But that explanation never comes.

Later in the story, faith enters the equation:

Jasper’s faith community — black and white ministers — worked together to ease racial tension. The Revs. Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson Jr. arrived. At one point, members of both the Ku Klux Klan and the New Black Panther Party rushed into town for protests. It was a spectacle built upon the fractured fault line of race.

“We thought this place was going to burn,” said the Rev. Ronald Foshage, pastor of St. Michael’s Catholic Church and three other small churches in the community, and a Byrd Foundation board member.

“It was a terrible, terrible time.”

How did the faith community work together to ease tensions? The Times doesnt say.

Keep reading, and theres this reference to faith:

Mr. Foshage and the Byrd family’s pastor at the time, the Rev. Kenneth Lyons, traveled the nation talking about Jasper, hate crimes and the role faith played in reconciliation.

Specifically, what was the role that faith played in reconciliation? The Times doesnt say.

In a story with so much attention to certain details, its strange that the paper doesnt see a need to elaborate on the role of religion — be it in the family forgiving the killers or faith helping in the reconciliation.

Yes, its a powerful story. But sadly, its also haunted by holy ghosts.",1

An allegedly intoxicated man, whose harassment of a woman wearing a Puerto Rico flag shirt at a Chicago park last month was captured on video, has been charged with felony hate crime counts, a spokesperson for the Cook County prosecutor’s office said.

Timothy Trybus, 62, is charged with two felony counts of hate crime, Cook County States Attorney spokeswoman Tandra Simonton said.

A man identified as Trybus is seen in a video accosting Mia Irizarry, 24, at the Caldwell Woods forest preserve in Chicago on June 14. Because of the Puerto Rican flag shirt Irizarry is wearing, the man in the video asks if she is a U.S. citizen and says youre not going to change us, you know that? and the world is not going to change the United States of America.

The harasser didnt seem to realize that Puerto Rico is, in fact, part of the United States America.

Irizarry had a permit for the space, officials said, and she says in the video she was there for a birthday party.

Felony hate crime is a class 3 felony, and carries a possible sentence of 2 to 5 years, but probation is also an option, Simonton said. She would not comment on whether prosecutors would seek probation or jail time in the case.

Trybus had also already been charged with misdemeanor assault and disorderly conduct. Those counts remain, but they could be dropped because the hate crime charges are the more serious, Simonton said.

It was not clear if Trybus had an attorney and a home phone number for him could not be immediately found. Trybus is scheduled to appear in court on a bond hearing on Friday, Simonton said.

Timothy Trybus is seen in this mug shot released by the Forest Preserves of Cook County.

The video of the exchange sparked outrage, and even Puerto Ricos governor, Ricardo Rosselló, weighed in and called it appalling and he said a Puerto Rican woman was brutally harassed by a bigot while an officer did not interfere.

On Wednesday, Patrick Connor, a Forest Preserves of Cook County police officer who was being investigated for allegedly failing to act during the harassment resigned on Wednesday, and the county board commissioner on Thursday apologized and called the incident truly appalling, gut wrenching, and a real wake-up call to everyone.",1

"Days after new data reported that anti-Semitic hate crimes have increased in New England by about one third over last year, a state task force created in the 1990s to combat hate crimes will be revived Monday.

Gov. Charlie Baker is planning to sign an executive order re-establishing the Governors Task Force on Hate Crimes and then swear in its members with Secretary of Public Safety and Security Daniel Bennett on Monday afternoon.

The task force was first created by Gov. William Weld in 1991 and codified by Gov. Paul Cellucci in 1997 to advise the Governor and the Secretary of the Executive Office of Public Safety on issues relating to the prevalence, deterrence, and prevention of hate crimes in the Commonwealth.

Last week, the Anti-Defamation League released new data reporting 132 anti-Semitic incidents in New England from Jan. 1 through Sept. 30 this year. That amount already exceeds the total for all of 2016 and represents a 32 percent increase over the same period last year, ADL said.

Of the 132 total incidents, which include harassment, vandalism, school incidents and threats made against Jewish institutions, 117 or about 89 percent occurred in Massachusetts, a 44 percent increase over 2016, according to ADL.

Anti-Semitism is sadly becoming a daily reality for thousands of Massachusetts residents, ADL New England Regional Director Robert Trestan said in a statement. When hate hits 58 cities and towns, all of us have a responsibility to step up and take action.

It is unclear who will serve on Bakers iteration of the task force or whether this group will have a specific charge. The executive order signing and swearing-in is scheduled for 4 p.m. in the governors office.",1
"DARIEN, CT — Three Darien residents reportedly were victims of separate bank fraud cases, prompting investigations by local police. In the first case, reported on June 7, a 51-year-old man lost $2,482.05 from his bank account in a larceny via wire fraud. The victim in this case reported that he had wired $2,482.05 from his [Citibank] bank account on 06/07/2017 to a Luis King who was using a United Bank of Charleston, SC bank account, wrote Darien police in a statement. The victim reported that he had been in contact with a Cory Hopper via texts and emails concerning an apartment rental, purportedly located at 101 Park Square in Stamford, over approximately a months time. The correspondence was the result of a Craigslist posting advertising an apartment rental. The victim stated he decided to wire the money on 06/07/2017 as he was being pressed for time by Cory Hopper on potentially losing the apartment rental. After wiring the money, the victim decided to call the leasing office at 101 Park Square in Stamford directly and found that there was no Cory Hopper or Luis King employed or known to anyone there. He also learned that Stamford PD had been notified by other potential victims of this apparent scam as well. The victim then called his bank in an effort to stop the wire transfer. The investigation is ongoing, and both banks have launched their own investigations, according to police. It was not disclosed if the victim was able to successfully stop the wire transfer. Once again, the Darien Police Department strongly cautions our residents to weigh all aspects of any online or wire transactions thoroughly and to fully consider all potential transactions with a high level of due diligence, wrote police. Sending or wiring money sight unseen or transacting business with unknown parties over the internet is many times a likely recipe for a significant loss. In the second case, reported on June 8, a 38-year-old resident reported to police that numerous transactions totaling $500 were fraudulently charged to his Wells Fargo Bank account, in what police described as a case of identity theft. Fraudulent charges were made at Target, Amazon and Paypal, wrote police. The resident did not suffer any monetary loss as the bank is reversing the charges and have opened their own investigation. There was no evidence of local criminal activity. Finally, on June 11, a 38-year-old Flushing, NY woman was arrested on numerous fraudulent credit card charges after she allegedly tried to use fake credit cards at a Peoples United Bank branch on Heights Road, according to Darien police. Officers were dispatched to the scene at about 11:15 a.m. after bank security notified police that a woman was trying to use fake cards at the banks ATM. Upon arrival, officers observed a white female, wearing a black shirt and red pants, in the ATM vestibule, wrote polie. The female was asked to step from the vestibule area. She was wearing what appeared to be a dark wig and dark sunglasses. The suspect, Gabriela Enache, was extremely nervous and would not answer basic questions posed by responding officers as to what she was doing at the bank and where she was coming from. Officers observed that Enache was holding an open wallet containing a large amount of cash and a large number of credit and/or gift cards. Ten Visa and American Express branded cards were recovered that, through the assistance of members of the Connecticut Financial Crimes Task Force, were confirmed to be fraudulently cloned cards. Arrested was Gabriela Enache who was charged with the following: Police also recovered more than $1,500 from Enaches wallet, all in twenty dollar bills which is the specific denomination dispensed by most ATM machines. Enache was held in lieu of a $150,000 bond and is scheduled to appear in Stamford Superior Court later this month. The investigation into this incident is continuing. Image via Shutterstock",0

The leader and deputy leader of Britain First – the far-right Facebook page, cum-shouty street team, cum-historically disastrous political party – have been jailed for 18 and 36 weeks respectively.

Paul Golding, 36, was found guilty of one count of religiously-aggravated harassment, while 31-year-old Jayda Retweeted By Trump Fransen was found guilty of three counts of the same charge.

The pair were arrested on the 10th of May, 2017 in relation to their unique style of campaigning against the defendants in a trial at Canterbury Crown Court – three Muslim men and a teenager, who were eventually convicted and jailed for raping a 16-year-old girl in a flat above the 555 Pizza takeaway shop in Ramsgate, Kent.

Both Golding and Fransen were convicted on a charge of religiously aggravated harassment for an incident at the takeaway on the 5th of May. Fransen banged on the shops windows and doors, the court heard, and screamed paedophile, rapist and foreigner while two children and a man – none of whom were directly related to the case – were inside.

Fransen was also convicted on another charge of harassment after turning up at a house she mistakenly believed to be owned by another defendant, and on a third charge for visiting the home of defendant Tamin Rahmani and shouting racist abuse through his door.

During the rape trial, Britain First distributed propaganda leaflets and uploaded videos pushing their agenda. Sentencing Golding and Fransen at Canterbury Crown Court, Judge Justin Barron said, I have no doubt it was their joint intention to use the facts of the case [in Canterbury] for their own political ends. It was a campaign to draw attention to the race, religion and immigrant background of the defendants.

Judge Barron added that the duos words and actions demonstrated hostility towards Muslims. This, of course, came as no surprise: Britain First has made its name through travelling the country, visiting mosques and harassing Muslims.

In case youre still not sure where youve heard of them, the group has also made the news for: picking up a dismal share of the vote in the 2016 London Mayoral elections, being roundly told to fuck off by the residents of towns where they have held demonstrations, and for that time US President Donald Trump retweeted three anti-Muslim videos posted by Jayda Fransen, one of which was shown to be fake news.

Attorneys in the trial of a man accused of a December hate crime at a Simi Valley mosque laid out their case to a Ventura County Superior Court jury on Thursday.

Marco De La Cruz, 27, of Simi Valley, is charged with assault with a deadly weapon with a special allegation of hate crime and with stabbing one of the worshipers at the mosque.

Members of the mosque next to a shopping center on Erringer Road pleaded with De La Cruz and his companion, John Matteson, to leave the area after tempers flared when one of them was told he could not use a restroom, Ryan Sheahan, a deputy district attorney at the Ventura County District Attorneys Office, told jurors in his opening statement Thursday.

Im going to ask you to find Mr. De La Cruz guilty of a hate crime, Sheahan told jurors as the defendant sat next to his attorney, Damon Jenkins, of the Ventura County Public Defenders Office.

The victim, Anisureham Shahnawaz, of Anaheim, testified Thrusday that he was stabbed on the night of Dec. 10, 2016, after a service at Jamia Al-Raazi Islamic Center of Simi Valley.

Worshipers told Simi Valley police that De La Cruz and Matteson walked from a nearby liquor store to the mosque.

Shahnawaz was inside the mosque when he said Matteson stepped inside asking if he could use the restroom.

I told him, No, sorry were closed. You cant use the restroom, Shahnawaz said from the stand on Thursday.

Shahnawaz and others said Matteson then walked outside where De La Cruz was waiting. They said Matteson was clearly upset and yelling profanities at mosque members, many of whom were out in the parking lot after the Saturday night services.

You guys need to leave the country; were going to kill all you guys, Shahnawaz said, recalling some of the anti-Muslim slurs that Matteson and De La Cruz are alleged to have used against congregants that night.

Shahnawaz also testified that De La Cruz told the crowd outside: What kind of place is this? You cant use the restroom. Youre always causing problems.

The argument soon escalated into a fight, Shahnawaz said, when Matteson began throwing punches at him.

I pushed him away from us, but he came at me again, Shahnawaz said. He said he then wrapped one of his arms around Mattesons head. Both men then went down and wrestled on the ground, he said.

I felt punches and kicking, Shahnawaz said, noting at one point he could see De La Cruz approaching him and Matteson.

While Shahnawaz said he never saw De La Cruz holding a knife, others in the crowd said they did.

Shahnawaz said Matteson and De La Cruz soon fled the area after learning that police had arrived.

Shahnawaz said he then lifted up his shirt.

I saw blood coming out, almost as if water was coming out of a glass, he said.

Shahnawaz had been stabbed on the right side of his lower abdomen. He was taken to Los Robles Hospital & Medical Center in Thousand Oaks, where he was treated for the serious stab wound.

Police found and arrested Matteson on a nearby street that same night.

He is charged with a hate crime and faces four counts of disturbing the peace by fighting. Matteson is scheduled for an arraignment June 14.

Patrick Zayicek, a detective with Simi Valley police, said De La Cruz was arrested five days later at his Simi Valley home.

De La Cruz is being held in Ventura County jail on bail of $110,000. His trial will resume at 9 a.m. Friday.

"A grand jury in Maryland returned a hate crime indictment against a white University of Maryland student charged with fatally stabbing a black student at another college in May, the prosecutor said.

Sean Urbanski, 22, had already been charged with murder and faced a potential sentence of life in prison in the fatal stabbing of Richard Collins III, a student at Bowie State University who had been commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Army.

Collins was visiting friends at the University of Marylands campus in College Park when he was killed.

Prince Georges County States Attorney Angela D. Alsobrooks said Tuesday that the grand jury returned an indictment on an additional charge of hate crime resulting in death after digital evidence was found on Urbanskis phone and in other places.

Collins was a few days shy of graduation when he was killed.

The hate crime addition means Urbanski could face a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole, plus 20 years. Alsobrooks said prosecutors would seek the maximum penalty.",1

"A Brooklyn rapper accused of screaming homophobic slurs at ​fast-food ​chicken patrons and slashing two men because he thought they were gay has been charged with assault as a hate crime.

​​

Little known rapper “Mousey Baby”​ ​–​ ​real name James Thomas​ ​– was arraigned on the charges Wednesday before Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Danny Chun, who held him on $150,000 bail.

Thomas, 32, barged into a Fulton Street Crown Fried Chicken on May 5, and started hurling vitriol at a number of men inside the restaurant, who had recently left the nearby Langston Club, according to authorities.

The Prospect Heights man then allegedly slashed one man across the face and fled the fast-food joint, but ran into two other men leaving the night club, known for its predominantly gay clientele.

Thomas pushed one of the men down, pulled out his knife, and stabbed the third man twice in the torso and once in the shoulder as he attempted to help his friend, prosecutors said.

He fled on foot before cops could arrive.

“In Brooklyn, everyone, regardless of their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender or religion must be able to safely walk the streets without fear of being senselessly attacked,” Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez said, adding the incident was “particularly egregious as he attacked three innocent people simply because he perceived them to be gay.

Thomas is scheduled to return to court in May.",1

"The Reno GBTQA Community Center (OUR Center) was the site of a vandal who smashed a window and door causing an estimated $7,500 to $10,000 worth of damage.

Panic in the community was quickly thwarted after it was reported the assailant(s) had actually shot into the building, but the quick thinking of many community members including Paco Lachoy of The Reno Gay Page took to social media to correct the reports.

Board President Jeromy Manke said in a presser that he was somewhat in shock, adding, “Witnesses in the building said a man in what appeared to be a ski mask approached the building and yelled ‘Get Down’ and then hurled rocks at the windows sending glass everywhere.”

According to Menke, the incident happened early Tuesday evening on January 2, at about 7 pm while people were still inside.

Reno Police Department spokesman Tim Broadway reports that four rocks were found, three taken in as evidence.

“Right now, we are investigating the incident as a destruction of property,” Broadway said. “We are in the early stages of the investigation. But the search is on for the person(s) responsible.”

Investigators are asking adjacent businesses for any CCTV footage that may help in the arrest of the vandal(s). At this time, it cannot be determined if the crime was fueled by hate because the sexual orientation of the perpetrator(s) is unknown.

People who were inside the building at the time of the incident fell to the floor and took cover wherever they could before calling police. There were no injuries reported according to The Reno Gay Page.

“We will be open as usual,” Manke said. “This won’t deter our mission to serve, to build, to strengthen the community.”

A Facebook video assessment was taken by Northern Nevada Pride Marketing Director YeVonne Allen of the damage, it is quickly going viral, garnering 20k views and 500 shares in hopes someone will come forward with a lead in the case.

Allen dictates her concern that even in her small community this type of incident can still happen, she says in the video, “…it sort of goes to show then even in what we think is progressive Reno, that we are getting so much better, so excepting, that there are people with so much hate in their hearts out there.”

The community is in shock and saddened that this could happen in what is supposed to be free of danger, “We wanted OUR Center to be a safe place,” said Manke.

Insurance may replace some of the broken items, but OUR Center relies heavily on community donations and they are asking for the communitys help to replace the windows.

"The former Main Line commissioner who was recently hit with federal child pornography charges on top of locally-filed charges was ordered to jail ahead of his trial Monday. Philip Ahr, who served as a Radnor Township Commissioner until late 2017, was ordered to be jailed until his upcoming trial Monday by U.S. Magistrate Judge Marilyn Heffley after the 67 year old turned himself in to federal authorities, Philly.com reports. Ahr remained free on bail for the child pornography-related charges filed against him in Delaware County until he was ordered to the Federal Detention Center in Philadelphia Monday. The news about Ahrs federal charges broke last week after an indictment was unsealed. The federal indictment charges Ahr – whose online monikers allegedly were DaddyX and DaddyXX – with two counts each of distribution and attempted distribution of child pornography and receipt of child pornography, as well as one count of possession of child pornography. The incidents leading to the charges span from 2013 to 2017, according to the charging document. These federal charges add to the 130 total charges related to child pornography filed in Delaware County, which are 10 counts of disseminating child pornography, 50 counts of child pornography possession, 60 counts of criminal use of a communication facility, and 10 counts of attempted dissemination of child pornography. Should Ahr be convicted, he faces up to a five-year sentence. His federal trial date has yet to be set. Ahr, of the Rosemont section of Radnor Township, was arrested Oct. 11 by Delaware County authorities following the announcement of a county-led investigation of unknown origin targeting Ahr in late September. He later resigned as the Radnor Township Board of Commissioners president, a position he was elected to in July 2017. However, he maintained his seat as the townships Ward 7 commissioner. Then in early November, Ahr resigned his role with the board entirely, leaving his seat vacant and forcing the township to appoint an interim commissioner.

The day started as a celebration of love but ended with hate and terror for 25-year-old elementary school teacher Brandon Soriano.

Soriano tells CBS2’s Ali Bauman he was just about to pick up food on his way home when two strangers attacked, totally unprovoked.

“Whatever anger they had they took it out on me,” Soriano said.

The victim was left with a busted lip and large, raised bruises around his head after he says his attackers approached him Sunday around 10 pm at the corner of 37th Avenue and 84th Street in Jackson Heights.

Soriano says one of them yelled an anti-gay slur then beat him to the ground and knocked him unconscious.

“I don’t know them from a hole in the wall,” he said. “Never spoke to them before.”

Soriano says he was celebrating the Queens pride parade hours earlier. He adds the block was bustling that night, and the area usually feels safe.

“Getting your butt kicked for the same reason you went to pride, just crazy,” Soriano said.

When he regained consciousness, police had arrived but his attackers were gone. His family says they hope they find the suspects soon, while Brandon says if he sees them again he’d cross the street and walk the other way.

He says the attack hasn’t left him scared or angry. Rather, he says he feels disillusioned.

“Homophobia is real and it’s annoying,” He said. “Definitely annoying.”

The NYPD’s Hate Crime Task Force is investigating the assault. Officers have been searching the block for surveillance images but police had not yet released a description of the suspects.",1
"A lesbian couple and two children were found dead in their home in upstate New York on the day after Christmas.

According to the Times Union, police believe the victims were murdered on December 21.

The bodies of Shanta Myers, 36, and her partner, Brandi Mells, 22, Jeremiah “JJ” Myers, 11, and Shanise Myers, 5, were found in their Troy apartment on December 26. The women, who got engaged last year, were found bound with their throats slashed. JJ and Shanise were two of Myers three children.

Prosecutors have charged two men with the crime. Justin Mann has been charged with three counts of second-degree murder and one count of first-degree murder, while James White has been charged with four counts of second-degree murder, the Times Union reported.

At a press conference on Wednesday, Troy Police Chief James Tedesco described the murders as an act of “savagery” and said that evidence at the crime scene suggested that the killings were “not a random act.”

Equality NY, a group that advocates for greater LGBT rights, said in a tweet that it was “heartbroken and angry.”

“One of our LGBTQI families, mom, girlfriend, and two children, were found brutally murdered in Troy, NY,” the group messaged. “We are heartbroken and angry.”

Neighbors and friends created an impromptu memorial for the victims, leaving candles and stuffed animals at the base of a tree outside their home.",1

(EDGE) A building owned by a gay couple from South Carolina was burned to the ground last week and the men are calling the incident a hate crime.

Tim Griffin and his partner Neil Griffin, from Pageland, S.C., woke up at 2 a.m. Friday morning when they smelled fire and smoke. But by the time the fire department arrived, the building was 80%, 90% gone, Tim Griffin told local news station WSOC-TV. The newly built 3,000-square-foot building was going to host the Miss Pageland Pageant beauty contest.

It went down just like that, he added. The men also said they lost all their pageant supplies, records and about 1,000 gowns they were storing.

The couple also said they believe the fire was motivated by hate. The men explained they have recently received violent threats on social media.

This town is dealing with a lot of hate right now, Tim Griffin said. This has just got to stop.

Pageland town officials confirmed to WSCO-TV that the couple requested law enforcement to investigate the online threats. Pageland Police Chief Craig Greenlee said law officials have labeled the fire suspicious but not a hate crime. Officials have yet released a cause of the fire.

Tim Griffin said the fire was suspicious as the building did not yet have electricity, adding there was only one car parked outside the building and that there was nothing combustable stored inside.

We cant take it anymore, emotionally and physically, Tim Griffin told WSCO-TV. Well go. Were done.

The building was going to be used for the annual Miss Pageland pageants, which would have served as a rehearsal space and a place for local kids to hang out. The men planned to have a pool table and a movie screen in the space.

New Now Next reports the Griffins apparently have issues with a few of Pagelands leaders. Tim Griffin has made several posts on Facebook since the fire. In one post, he accuses councilwoman Elaine Robertson and her family of posting comments about harming us, shooting us, running us out of town -- calling us fags, child molesters, child-porn distributors, threatening Neils job and on and on.

He added that after reporting the threats to authorities, they did nothing.

The couple have, however, thanked local police and many other in their community for their support. Find Tims posts below.

"Battle Creek police are investigating an alleged hate crime after a man says he was the victim of an attack at an area liquor store. 24-year-old Derrick Kilbourn, who is gay, has gained attention on social media after posting about his experience.

Kilbourn says he and his mother stopped at Sams Discount Party Store on Dickman Road when he noticed someone staring at him as we went to enter the store. When he returned to his car, Kilbourn says the man and two others came up to him and started harassing him using homophobic slurs and threatening to beat him up and drag him through the mud. The situation escalated when one of the men punched out the back window of his car.

An officer who responded to the scene initially told Kilbourn to simply file the car damage with his insurance company. The Battle Creek Police Department says they are now investigating the case as a hate crime and are trying to identify the suspects through surveillance video.",1

"Civil rights advocates in Oregon are angry with the ACLUs defense of so-called alt-right groups and their planned pro-Donald Trump free speech rallies in the wake of reported white supremacist Jeremy Joseph Christians alleged brutal murder of two men.

Pro-Black Lives Matter community activist Teressa Raiford of the Dont Shoot Portland organization said she fears there will be more violence and bloodshed if the groups are allowed to demonstrate as planned on Sunday, June 4.

Counterprotests are also planned, but Raiford said she wont be there.

I dont want anybody being killed or murdered because of my presence, Raiford said in a phone interview Wednesday. The police will allow us to be assaulted, abused and murdered. Weve been attacked by the police and white supremacists during the entire time weve been protesting since 2014.

Christian shouting in court Tuesday Beth Nakamura/AP

In court Tuesday, Christian shouted, Free speech or die, Portland! during his arraignment on murder charges.

You got no right to safe space! he yelled at the courtroom gallery where Micah David-Cole Fletcher, 21, his lone surviving victim, sat listening with neck stab wounds visible for all to see, a reminder of the violence that often follows when hate speech goes unchecked.

Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler has opposed the demonstrations, reaffirming on Monday that city government will not grant protest permits to the alt-right event organizers, who instead have applied to protest in the citys Schrunk Plaza park space, which Wheeler says is controlled by the federal government.

In a Facebook post Monday, Wheeler asked federal officials to deny the white nationalists protest permits given the tragic events that just occurred.

Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler AP

Our City is in mourning, our communitys anger is real, and the timing and subject of these events can only exacerbate an already difficult situation, Wheeler wrote on Facebook.

In spite of the uproar, organizer Joey Gibson told the local Tom and Curley radio show on Monday his group Patriot Prayer is proceeding with its rally.

The ACLU — which has frequently made headlines in 2017 for its efforts against many of President Donald Trumps statements and policies, especially regarding his failed Muslim travel ban — is defending Gibson and his followers on First Amendment grounds, even if it leads to more violence.

Local ACLU legal director Mat dos Santos reaffirmed the organizations position on Twitter Monday.

A pattern of violence

The ACLU and NAACP are often allies on many issues, but according to Portland NAACP President Jo Ann Hardesty, this isnt one of them.

As soon as you start preaching hate to the point you start physically endangering people, that is unacceptable, Hardesty said in an interview Wednesday.

She pointed to the recent pattern of violence involving white supremacists attacking people of color.

On March 20, a self-avowed white supremacist stalked and fatally stabbed Timothy Caughman in New York City just for being black.

On May 22, another suspected white supremacist fatally stabbed African-American Richard Collins III in Maryland.

Alt-right protesters clashed with counterprotesters in New Orleans in May in defense of Confederate monuments and hosted a tiki-torchlit rally in Charleston, Virginia, for the same reason.

In fact, since 2016, the alt-right has contributed to a 20% spike in major city hate crimes and an 86% spike in anti-semitic incidents nationally.

Raiford said white nationalists in Portland have video-recorded and created digital profiles of her and other Black Lives Matter activists, sharing their records with other Aryan groups to target black activists, some of whom have had their homes vandalized or been physically assaulted.

They go everywhere we go, Raiford said. Theyve threatened me on social media using Twitter. They called me mama bear at a school board meeting. The police told us we cant worry about being threatened because they have a right to be in the same space. Weve had kids filing complaints finding swastikas on desks and they do nothing.

Oregons racist past and present

Despite its liberal reputation nationally, Oregon is a state with a storied history of white supremacy that clearly lives on today.

Founded by southerners in 1859, the state once banned African Americans from living there, according to Newsweek. During the 1920s, Oregon boasted the nations highest per capita Klan membership.

Hardesty says this is the historical context the ACLU needs to consider.

In a state where white supremacy was the founding doctrine, we have to make sure we dont let that take hold ever again, she said.

But Hardestys progressive ally Jamie Partridge, a labor organizer with Portlands International Socialist Organization, disagreed with her.

His group is one of 35 organizations planning the Portland Stands United Against Hate counterprotest Sunday afternoon.

In the current political climate, especially considering whos in the White House, our organization believes its dangerous that the state can use free speech suppression to suppress our side, Partridge said in a phone interview Wednesday.

We need to show [white supremacists] through the power of the people that the people of Portland, the people of this country, are opposed to them and their racism, Partridge said. We shouldnt rely on government permits to discourage them.",1

"Hate Crimes

Hate (or bias) crimes have a wider effect upon a community than random crimes. While we all feel sympathy and compassion for victims of random crime, we don’t usually take it “personally” or become fearful ourselves. However, the reaction to hate crimes is often different because victims of hate crimes are selected based upon one’s belief, right or wrong, that the victim merely belongs to a group of people he or she dislikes. As such, other members of that targeted group often react strongly with outrage and fear, and worry about their own future wellbeing.

Westchester County District Attorney Anthony A. Scarpino, Jr. believes in the thorough investigation and strong prosecution of these despicable acts of violence. The Bias Crimes Unit is a Vertical Prosecution Unit that is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all such crimes occurring within the county and bringing the perpetrators to justice. If you are a victim of a hate crime, call 911 and tell the police that you believe you are the victim of a hate crime. If you have any questions, or need any additional information, contact the Hate Crimes Unit of the District Attorney’s Office at (914) 995-4172.",1

"National Coalition of Anti-Violence Projects Releases A crisis of hate: Report on LGBTQ Hate Violence Homicides in 2017

Highest number Ever Recorded: 52 Hate Violence Homicides Targeting LGBTQ and HIV affected people Recorded in 2016, A 86% Increase From 2016

New York, NY - January 22, 2018 - The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP) today released their annual national research report on hate violence targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) and HIV-affected communities. In August 2017, NCAVP recorded the highest number of anti-LGBTQ homicides in their 20-year history of tracking and released a mid-year report to raise awareness of this disturbing increase. Since the release of that report in August of 2017, the number of reported homicides continued to increase, reaching a total of 52 reported anti-LGBTQ homicides in all of 2017 – the highest number ever recorded and an 86% increase from 2016.

Said Beverly Tillery, Executive Director of the Anti-Violence Project (AVP): This report is a wake-up call for all of us. Our communities live in an increasingly hostile and dangerous climate, after a year of anti-LGBTQ rhetoric and policies coming from the White House, Federal government agencies, state and local sources and in our communities across the country. Anti-LGBTQ violence has long been a crisis, but NCAVP has watched the escalation of violence this past year with great concern. I urge everyone to read the stories and look at the photos of the 52 individuals lost to hate violence in 2017 – they are our friends, family, co-workers and fellow LGBTQ community members. NCAVP will continue to say their names and re-commits to doing all we can to prevent hate violence and support survivors. We must bring more attention and action to deal with this epidemic of violence and work across all of our diverse communities to protect those most vulnerable and stand up to the hostile forces that have created this unacceptable climate of hate.

Report summary:

The victims of these hate violence related homicides have overwhelmingly been transgender women and queer, bi, or gay cisgender men,

There was a significant increase of reports of homicides of queer, bi, or gay cisgender men, from 4 reports in 2016 to 20 reports in 2017,

For the last five years NCAVP has documented a consistent and steadily rising number of reports of homicides of transgender women of color, which continued into 2017,

In 2017, NCAVP collected information on 27 hate-violence related homicides of transgender and gender non-conforming people this year, compared to 19 reports for 2016,

22 of these homicides were of transgender women of color; and

Of the total number of homicides in 2017, 71% (n=37) of the victims were people of color:

31 (60%) of the victims were Black, 4 (8%) were Latinx, 2 (4%) were Asian, and 1 (2%) was Native.

The full report can be found here: https://avp.org/Crisisofhate and contains additional information and a narrative of each case recorded.

"BOCA RATON, Fla. - After an investigation, Palm Beach County Sheriffs Office said Wednesday that it doesnt believe a recent assault on a Muslim student was a hate crime.

The case garnered national attention after a video of the fight was published on social media. The video shows a group of teenage girls beating a 14-year-old West Boca High School student.

Deputies said they interviewed the suspects about the Dec. 21 fight at Sunset Cove Amphitheatre Park. They also met West Boca Raton High School officials.

“All participants agreed the fight was over a boy and a video that was circulated, the sheriffs office said in a statement. All parties agreed to meet and to fight and a specific location and time. There is no evidence of a hate crime.”

The sheriffs office said the girls could face charges of simple battery.

The girls father, Shakeel Munshi, had said earlier that his daughter was targeted because she is Muslim.

Omar Saleh, a civil right attorney for the Council on Islamic Relations, said his organization has accepted the findings of the sheriffs office, but said the assault is still disturbing.

Whether it was over a boy or religiously motivated, based on what weve seen on the video the actions are atrocious, Saleh said.

"Betsy Devos has appointed Candice E. Jackson, an attorney and author, as the acting head of the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights. Jackson, who was officially appointed as deputy assistant secretary, will only serve as acting head until Devos nominates an official assistant secretary, a role that requires Senate confirmation. However, Jackson’s views are still a troubling sign of Devos’ priorities.

Jackson is not particularly high-profile in the policy world, with limited experience in civil rights law (surprise, surprise). Her most recent high-profile action was bringing Bill Clinton’s accusers to a presidential debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton. However, ProPublica has recently published some of her quotes, and…she’s argued against both feminism and affirmative action, and called the women who accused Donald Trump of sexual assault and harassment “fake victims.” Given that her office is entrusted with enforcing Title IX and civil rights law in educational institutions, these views are very troubling.

While an undergraduate at Stanford, Jackson wrote for the conservative Stanford Review, founded by Peter Thiel. After discovering that a section of her calculus class which “provided students with extra help on challenging problems” was reserved for minority students, she wrote, “I am especially disappointed that the University encourages these and other discriminatory programs. We need to allow each person to define his or her own achievements instead of assuming competence or incompetence based on race.”

(I could go on about the many ways that reverse racism doesn’t exist, but instead I’ll point you to this excellent resource at The Root, which sums it up succinctly.)

Jackson also wrote of affirmative action, “As with most liberal solutions to a problem, giving special assistance to minority students is a band-aid solution to a deep problem. No one, least of all the minority student, is well served by receiving special treatment based on race or ethnicity.”

On feminism, Jackson wrote in her senior year, “Women have the same opportunities as men to advance their careers, raise families, and pursue their personal goals. College women who insist on banding together by gender to fight for their rights are moving backwards, not forwards.”

In fairness to Jackson, she was quite young when she wrote these op-eds. It’s entirely possible that she’s matured since then, and no one deserves to be treated as if their teenage views are the bedrock of their lifelong political commitments. Since her university days, she has at least argued against over-criminalization over at Reason. She has also written a book about the women affected by Bill Clinton’s alleged sexual harassment and assault, Their Lives, and advocated for them. Jackson is herself a rape survivor, so these issues are certainly personal to her.

However, she has also doubled down on a lot of her conservative views. She worked for the conservative legal group Judicial Watch and praised a professor who called the 1964 Civil Rights Act “monstrous.” In that same 2005 book about Bill Clinton’s victims, she criticized existing sexual harassment laws for causing men to “self-censor themselves to avoid being accused of sexual harassment” and ignoring “the reality that unwanted sexual advances are difficult to define.” After a number of women accused Donald Trump of sexual harassment and assault, she wrote on Facebook that they were “frankly, fake victims” who lied for “political gain.” Given her vocal support for Bill Clinton’s accusers, this was a disturbing about-face.

I recommend you read the full ProPublica story for a look at all her views.

Commenting on Jackson’s appointment, Liliana Garces, who is a co-director of the Center for Education and Civil Rights at Pennsylvania State University, said, “I am deeply troubled that someone who has held an idea of reverse discrimination will be holding this role…Statements about reverse discrimination reflect a particular ideology that is detrimental to how we go about addressing racial inequality.”

Theodore Shaw, the director of the Center for Civil Rights at the University of North Carolina School of Law, said, “I hope that she’s not going to be an adversary to the civil rights community, and I hope that the administration is going to enforce civil rights laws and represent the best interests of those who are affected by civil rights issues.”

However, like the rest of us, he admits that this appointment “doesn’t leave me with a feeling of confidence with where the administration might be going.”

"Travel advisories warn you to carefully consider visiting certain places. Reasons typically range from severe weather to government instability, from civil war to terrorism.

The US State Department issues such advisories on a regular basis. Earlier this month it warned Americans against traveling to Somalia because of widespread terrorist and criminal activity, including kidnappings, bombings and murders.

Last week, the NAACP issued a travel advisory of its own, warning people of color that their civil rights could be violated in the state of Missouri.

The advisory, issued by the Missouri NAACP State Conference and endorsed by the national organization, is the first of its kind in the civil rights organizations 108-year history. Individuals traveling in the state are advised to travel with extreme CAUTION, the advisory says. Race, gender and color based crimes have a long history in Missouri.

Why the Show Me state? Why now?

A Jim Crow Bill

Rod Chapel Jr., Missouri NAACP State Conference president, said Senate Bill 43 -- a new state law making it more difficult to sue for housing or employment discrimination -- coupled with a long history of civil rights violations and discrimination forced the action.

Senate Bill 43 drastically shifts the burden of proof from defendant to plaintiff in employment and other discrimination cases, Gerald Early, chair of African and African American Studies at Washington University in St. Louis, wrote last week.

Before, a plaintiff had to show that race or gender bias was a contributing factor to dismissal, Early said.

Under 43, the plaintiff must prove that bias was, in effect, the sole reason that explains the treatment he or she received.

The Missouri NAACP State Conference calls it a Jim Crow Bill.

It says that you cannot sue the individual that harassed or discriminated against you, Chapel said. Thats a first. Thats different.

The ACLU of Missouri praised Chapels visionary leadership during this shameful act in Missouris history.

We are saddened the Missouri Legislature chose to continue its mistreatment of people of color and women by passing Senate Bill 43, ACLU executive director Jeffrey Mittman said in a statement.

Senate Bill 43 guts the Missouri Human Rights Act -- a piece of legislation that was both innovative, inclusive and modeled what our democracy should champion: equal rights for all.

The legislature passed the controversial bill in June. Gov. Eric Greitens signed it into law. Greitens and other supporters said the law puts Missouris standards for lawsuits in line with other states.

None of those other jurisdictions say that individuals that discriminate and harass other folks have immunity, Chapel said.

The governors office has not commented on the advisory, but acknowledged that Greitens met with passionate advocates on both sides of the issue.

The Missouri Division of Tourism has not responded to requests for comment.

Discrimination and looming danger

The NAACP advisory -- which the organizations St. Louis County branch opposed -- cited several incidents in Missouri as examples of discrimination and looming danger for people of color who venture there.

Among them is the case of Tory Sanford, an African-American man who died in a Missouri jail cell in May after getting lost and running out of gas on a drive to Memphis.

Its unclear why Sanford, 28, was taken into custody. However, he was involved in two altercations with jail personnel in his cell, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley told CNN affiliate WKRN. His death is under investigation.

In May, Missouri state Rep. Rick Brattin came under fire for saying on the House floor that theres a distinction between homosexuality and just being a human being -- a statement an editorial in The Kansas City Star called deplorable.

In 2015, the University of Missouris president and chancellor stepped down after African-American students accused school leaders of not adequately addressing racism on the overwhelmingly white Columbia campus.

Hate crimes

The NAACP also cited hate crimes as grounds for issuing the travel advisory.

Srinivas Kuchibhotla, 32, died after he was shot at a bar outside Kansas City in February. The Indian man was having an after-work beer with a friend in Olathe, Kansas, when Adam Purinton allegedly shot him and two other men.

The gunman reportedly shouted Get out of my country before opening fire.

Purinton was indicted in June on federal hate crime and other charges.

The suspect was arrested hours after the shooting at an Applebees restaurant in Clinton, Missouri, about 70 miles away from Olathe. Purinton reportedly told a bartender, who made a 911 call, that he had shot two Iranians.

The shooting raised worries among Indians and other communities about possible violence against foreign workers in the US.

In November, about 200 students at Ladue High School in St. Louis walked out of class to protest incidents in which African-American students were assaulted with racial taunts and a hot glue gun, CNN affiliate KTVI reported. Facebook posts by the mother of one student showed burns he received when poked with a hot glue gun.

In 2016, there were 98 hate crimes committed by 135 people in the state, according to a report by the Missouri State Highway Patrol. Compared to the year before, the figures represent a 3.9% decrease in hate crimes, but a 15.3% increase in known offenders.

Most offenses had a bias of anti-race/ancestry, the report said.

Police profiling and violence

The NAACP also noted tensions between police and minority communities in the state.

Michael Brown, 18, who was black, was shot and killed by white Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson in August 2014.

The shooting sparked outrage and protest across the country. Many protesters saying they felt that Ferguson was a reminder that the American criminal justice system doesnt treat blacks and whites the same -- and that young black men in particular are often killed with impunity.

Demonstrators took to the streets later when a grand jury chose not to indict Wilson -- burning buildings, looting shops and destroying cars. In more than 150 cities, protesters blocked bridges and tunnels, spilled into roadways and disrupted that years holiday shopping.

An investigation by the Justice Department brought no charges against Wilson, who argued he shot Brown in self defense as Brown charged at him.

In February 2016, the federal government sued Ferguson after the city council voted to change the terms of a deal on police reforms.

Negotiations on reforms to the police force and municipal court system began after a 2015 Justice Department investigation found that the Ferguson Police Department discriminated against African-Americans, targeting them disproportionately for traffic stops, use of force and jail sentences.

The NAACPs travel advisory also cited a state attorney general report that found African-American drivers were 75% more likely to be stopped and searched than white drivers.

Were looking for a way to truly move Missouri forward ... Its a travel advisory. We dont have power to put a travel ban on anybody. Were just saying if you come, you should think about this, the NAACPs Capel said.",1
"White supremacist James Harris Jackson revealed details of his plan to massacre black men in New York City during a recent jailhouse interview.

Trump sent his AG out to scare whites about immigrants. Of course, no word about the murderer James Harris Jackson, a white citizen. pic.twitter.com/Ru3mGgGdFS — Chad Smith (@chadssmith) March 27, 2017

No need to wonder if the white supremacist who stabbed a black man to death in New York City last week feels any remorse — he doesn’t.

In an exclusive Rikers Island jail interview conducted by the New York Daily News with murderer James Harris Jackson, Jackson said that his only regret about killing 66-year-old Timothy Caughman is that he would rather have killed “a young thug” or “a successful older black man with blondes … people you see in Midtown,” or “these younger guys that put white girls on the wrong path.”

Read More Timothy Caughman: The Man Who Was Killed For The Crime Of Being Black

“I didn’t know he was elderly,” Jackson, 28, reportedly said of Caughman, as if to suggest that if he had known that detail, he would have spared his life.

Adding insult to injury, Jackson said he intended his killing of Caughman to be a test run before carrying out a larger plan with more bloodshed, but he never got around to finishing the job.

“I got depressed. ... I saw it was too late. It’s irreversible,” he said, adding, “I didn’t want to put my family through any more pain” — never mind the grieving relatives of the innocent man whose blood is on his hands.

While the killer admitted that his “typical liberal Democrat” family didn’t raise him to be racist, he claimed to have had his first racist thoughts at just 3 years old. He said the ideal era in U.S. history is “1950s America,” which is when Jim Crow was very much in full swing.

Jackson said that by carrying out these killings, he sought to discourage white women from interracial relationships. He stated that he thought if he killed enough black men that white women would start to think, “Well, if that guy feels so strongly about it, maybe I shouldn’t do it.”

“The white race is being eroded. ... No one cares about you. The Chinese don’t care about you, the blacks don’t care about you,” he reportedly said.

After taking a bus from Baltimore to New York City with the premeditated agenda to kill black men, Jackson said he still doesn’t understand why he’s facing hate crime charges.

“I don’t hate anyone I don’t think is on my level,” he said.

To say that this man is deranged would be an understatement. Although the circumstances are heartbreaking and reprehensible, the one slightest glimmer of light in this ordeal is that this deplorable being is off the streets.

"State Rep. Meagan Hanson (R-Brookhaven) said she will file a hate crimes bill in the General Assembly Jan. 3, noting Georgia is one of only five states in the country without such a law.

The proposed law would add enhanced punishments for crimes committed against protected classes of people based on race, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, mental disability and physical disability, Hanson said. Those are the same classes protected under the federal hate crimes law passed in 2010, she said. The final bill is still being tweaked, she said, and complete details are not yet available.

“It is an interesting political time right now … in the midst of what happened in Charlottesville,” Hanson said in an interview on why she decided to sponsor the bill.

In August, white supremacists marched in the streets of Charlottesville, Va., and waved Nazi flags while chanting against Jews and other minorities. A woman protesting the white supremacists was killed.

Hanson said she was convinced it was time to sponsor a bill after meeting and working with local leaders of the Anti-Defamation League, a national advocacy group pushing for state hate crimes legislation. She said she has also talked to prosecutors and to Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Vernon Keenan who support such a bill.

“It’s shocking that Georgia doesn’t have this [hate crimes legislation] on the books,” she said.

The FBI defines a hate crime as one committed with the “added element of bias” against someone because of who they are who someone thinks they are. For example, if someone spray paints a racial slur on a black church, that could be considered a hate crime, or if someone beats up someone because they are gay, that could also be considered a hate crime.

A person convicted of a hate crime typically has added punishment, such as a longer prison sentence, known as “penalty enhancements.”

At one time, Georgia had a hate crimes law. In 2000, the General Assembly passed a bill calling for enhanced punishment for crimes committed due to “bias or prejudice.” The state Supreme Court in 2004 threw the law out, however, calling it “unconstitutionally vague” for not specifying biases, such as a crime committed against someone because of their religion or sexual orientation.

Hate crimes legislation has been raised in the General Assembly several times over the years, but has never gained serious traction. Hanson said she understands passage of such a bill is an uphill battle.

“I am not unaware of the struggles this bill faces,” she said. “We are taking it one step at a time.”

Those struggles basically fall along party lines, she said.

“I believe both sides of the aisle find this to be a partisan issue,” she said. “To me, it’s good policy and should be non-partisan. It saddens me a little bit that this is a partisan issue.” She said state Rep. Wendell Willard (R-Sandy Springs) has said he will sign on to her bill.

Last year, when Hanson faced Taylor Bennett for House District 80, which includes Brookhaven, some of Sandy Springs and Chamblee, she came under fire by some activists for what they called anti-transgender tweets.

With gender identity included as a protected class in her bill, how does Hanson plan to respond to potential criticism for her past statements?

“I used the word ‘tranny’ in 2011. I didn’t know it was a bad word then. I don’t use it today,” she said. “All I can say is sorry.”

The other tweet called out an AJC tweet for a story about two transgender teens who fell in love.

“[The story] was just about a normal, every day thing that happens. They were trying to sensationalize something that is normal,” she said.

She said she was never contacted about the tweets and was not given the “benefit of the doubt” by her detractors. She said she is supportive of LGBT issues and opposes “religious liberty” bills.

“My record speaks for itself,” she said.

She noted Georgia Equality, an LGBT advocacy organization, is one of the organization’s supporting her bill.

She faces re-election in 2018.",1
"An Indian national who was wounded in a racially charged shooting in an Olathe, Kan., bar that resulted in the death of his friend told detectives that the shooter asked the pair if their “status was legal” before he started shooting, an affidavit released on Monday reveals.



According to CBS News, the FBI is currently looking into the shooting, which left Indian national Srinivas Kuchibhotla dead and Alok Madasani injured, as a hate crime. A third victim, Ian Grillot, was also shot and injured when he reportedly tried to intervene in 51-year-old suspect Adam Purinton’s rant.

According to CBS News, a detective noted in the affidavit that Grillot and another person had asked Purinton to leave Austin’s bar and grill that evening. The network notes that some of the affidavit has been redacted, but the document did specifically note that Madasani told detectives that Purinton asked whether the Indian men’s “status was legal.”

Both Kuchibhotla and Madasani worked as engineers for wearable-technology company Garmin in Olathe.

Purinton was reportedly escorted from the bar but returned some 30 minutes later with a handgun. Madasani said that he heard people around him saying, “He’s back and he has a gun!” before he was hit in the leg.

Witnesses also said that Purinton yelled, “Get out of my country,” before opening fire.

Surveillance cameras at the bar recorded both the initial confrontation and 30 minutes later, when Purinton allegedly returned to the bar and started shooting.

Purinton is currently being held in a Johnson County, Kan., jail with a $2 million bond on murder and attempted murder charges.

"UPDATE, 9:30 P.M. Nov. 7 -- Tip leads to arrest of suspect in beating of gay teenager

MUSKEGON HEIGHTS, MI - Police are pulling out all stops to find the people who beat a teen and stripped him naked because he is gay and then posted a video of the assault on Facebook.

The hate crime occurred the evening of Saturday, Nov. 4, in the city of Muskegon Heights, said Police Chief Joseph E. Thomas Jr.

They beat him up because hes gay, Thomas said.

Through analysis of the video, Thomas has identified a suspect and is asking the publics help in locating him.

The 18-year-old suspect is Trevon Lee Godbolt, who also is known as Trevon Lee Taylor, Thomas said. His last known address was in the city of Muskegon. There is a $500 reward for information leading to his arrest.

The disturbing video shows the 17-year-old being beaten while at least one other person is using a phone to video record. The victim asks his attacker to please stop, as the suspect identified as Godbolt repeatedly asks Why you on this gay s---? The victim is repeatedly called derogatory terms as he is beaten.

At the end he is forced to strip naked and is allowed to run off. Women can be heard laughing and yelling catch him.

Thomas said he believes in addition to Godbolt, there was another man and two women involved.

Were going to be investigating this fully, Thomas said. All participants are going to have a hard time.

The victim was lured to the area of Edgewood School where he was assaulted, he said.

The prosecutors office has authorized two counts against Godbolt: unarmed robbery and unlawful imprisonment. They carry harsher penalties - up to 15 years -- than assault, Thomas said.

The prosecutors office also reviewed an ethnic intimidation charge or some other hate crime, but the state does not have a criminal statute covering assaults based on sexual orientation, according to a press release from Muskegon County Prosecutor D.J. Hilsons office.

Thomas said he had contacted the FBI, which has expressed an interest in pursuing the case federally.

Were not going to let this go. Were going to hunt him down, Thomas said of Godbolt.

Thomas said he received a phone call at 8:30 p.m. Nov. 4 from a citizen saying a naked man was in front of a church at Summit Avenue and Howden Street. A responding officer found the teen walking into a home in the area, he said.

He was going into his aunts house and he was in the nude, Thomas said. He was naked.

The victim was incoherent and taken to the hospital for treatment, the chief said.

The following morning, Nov. 5, the chief was sent a copy of the video that was posted on Facebook.

We join the community of Muskegon County in expressing our outrage over this senseless act of violence, the press release from the prosecutors office states. We will work to protect this particular victim and any other victim that is targeted because of his or her sexual identity or orientation.

Anyone with information about Godbolts whereabouts is asked to call 911 or Silent Observer, (231) 72-CRIME. Tips also can be left on the website www.silentobservermuskegon.com.",1

"On April 18, a man shot three people dead in Fresno, California.

Okay, okay: on April 18, a black man shot three white men dead in Fresno.

Fine: on April 18, a black man who supported black nationalist movements shot three white men dead in Fresno.

FINE: on April 18, a black man named Kori Ali Muhammad, who supported black nationalist movements and Black Lives Matter, shot three white men dead in Fresno, and yelled “Allahu Akbar!” as he did it.

Muhammad was a militant black nationalist who wanted to kill white men, and he did. One was a trainee at a power company. Another was carrying groceries. The third was in the parking lot of a Catholic charity. Last week, he shot another white man, a 25-year-old security guard at a Motel 6.

This would have been the first domestic terrorist attack since Trump was elected, except it’s not being investigated as a terrorist attack. That’s right: Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer said the incident had “nothing to do with terrorism in spite of the statement [Muhammad] made.” The Fresno police department called the FBI in to help, who are also not treating the shooting as an act of terrorism. The shooting is being treated as a hate crime.

On top of it, AP didn’t report in its breaking story that Muhammad shouted “Allahu Akbar.” Instead, they translated it to English, saying he “shouted ‘God is great’ in Arabic.” (That’s technically not quite accurate: “Allahu akbar” translates to “God is greater” or “God is the greatest.”)

Yes, America: you can shout “Allahu Akbar!” as you’re murdering white people and still not be a terrorist.

After the attack, “Allahu Akbar” was trending on Twitter, and it was the most frightening, hateful thread I’ve ever seen on there. Plus, it was trending higher than “Fresno,” the thread for the shooting itself. And even that thread was appalling. Here are the first tweets that popped up when I clicked the “Fresno” hashtag on Twitter:

















And one got personal:

This seething Islamophobia isn’t news. But now it’s become a threat. I allowed myself to articulate yesterday what I’ve felt for months: many Americans want to radicalize jihadists in the United States just as bad as ISIS does. They want more attacks. They want a reason… Oh, what they’d give for a reason… But why wait when you can bait?

If you’re not scared, you’re not paying attention.

You can shout “Allahu akbar” as you’re murdering people and still not be a terrorist

I know what Muhammad shouted. I am well aware, thank you, and I forgive you from jumping to the conclusion that this was terrorism. Given what we hear, especially in hateful alternative reality crawlspaces of the internet and from the rectal mouth of our President, the reaction makes sense on the surface. But I analyze terrorism every single day. It’s my job. And this wasn’t jihadist terrorism. This was a hate crime.

The FBI defines terrorism as “the unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.” But this attack (again, in spite of “Allahu akbar!”) wasn’t motivated by religion or politics or to further political or social objectives. The Fresno police and the FBI, who aren’t treasonous liberal snowflakes, agree: the shooting was motivated simply by hate for white people, specifically white men.

Muhammad, according to his father, believed there was a battle coming between whites and blacks. He posted a bunch of black nationalist stuff on Facebook, and, yes, some of it included “Allahu Akbar” next to extremist, hateful language.

But Muhammad has much more in common with other killers, white killers, than he does with jihadists. After all, Muhammad let non-white, non-men go unharmed. Jihadists don’t do that. They kill indiscriminately. If a Muslim doesn’t subscribe to the batshit jihadist belief that the Koran compels them to kill non-Muslims, that Muslim is a non-Muslim and will also be killed.

Check out the case of Benjamin Smith, a member of the neo-Nazi “World Church of the Creator” who, over Independence Day, carried out drive-by shootings on random minorities in Illinois and Indiana. This was treated as a hate crime, not terrorism.

Or Buford Furrow, who shot up a Los Angeles Jewish Community Center with a semi-automatic the same year. He wasn’t charged with terrorism either.

How about Dylann Roof? He murdered nine black people in a Charleston, SC, church because they were black and he wanted to start a race war. The media and, yes, black people were indeed up in arms about that racially motivated massacre. Roof was convicted of murder and 12 counts of hate crime charges. He’s unrepentant and even in the face of his sentencing maintains those people deserved to die for being black. But he was never charged with terrorism. Plus, it took five days for federal prosecutors—led by (black) attorney general Loretta Lynch—to even charge Dylann Roof with hate crimes.

Muhammad was facing hate crimes within an hour of his arrest. Dylann Fucking Roof? Black attorney general? Five days.

And this hateful killer supported Black Lives Matter. That does not make it a white hate group. I fully support Black Lives Matter and I love white people. Does that make Black Lives Matter a white love group?

What’s more, Fresno police believe Muhammad was homeless. He’s been in and out of jail. In 2005, he was arrested for selling cocaine and possessing an illegal gun. Court papers at the time said he appeared mentally unstable: he was having hallucinations and he’d been hospitalized two times for mental health problems. He appeared to have psychosis. Before that, he’d been convicted twice on fraud charges and also had a DUI.

Is this a jihadist? No. It’s a fucking crazy, mentally disturbed black supremacist. Check out his insane rap video. Check out the video where he threatens to kill white people—not because he wants to kill non-Muslims in the name of Allah, even though he speaks in Arabic and says “Allahu Akbar,” but simply because he’s a crazy black supremacist who wants to kill white people. He’s very explicit about this.

If you’re not frightened, you’re not paying attention

The warning that our former President, Mr. Barack Hussein Obama, and our current military commanders, including General H.R. McMaster, Trump’s National Security Advisor, have always given us is to not associate terrorists with Islam. That’s exactly what the terrorists want, we say. Jihadist groups such as ISIS use that narrative as propaganda. There’s tons of evidence that this radicalizes people and helps convince grassroots terrorists, who are inspired by ISIS but not connected to them, to attack Americans.

Here I would like to take the opportunity to annoyingly point out to my Islamophobe brothers and sisters that Kori Ali Muhammad is as American as you or I. Even this were a jihadist attack, the “travel ban” would do exactly nothing to stop it, or attacks like it. The problem is at home.

I used to be comfortable making that argument against the travel ban. It’s a solid argument. But I’m afraid it’s also a naive argument. Here’s the response today: If the problem is at home, then we have to ban Muslims from coming here and take Muslims out of America.

The truth is now clear: many Americans want to radicalize Muslims just as badly as ISIS does. They want this for the same reason, too: to justify a war between America and Islam. Many of your fellow American citizens are looking for a reason to deport, arrest, and kill Muslims, even (sometimes specifically) Muslim-Americans. They’re more than willing to uncork all of the bilious madness that’s been boiling inside their self-selected pressure-cooker monomedia helmets. Any reason will do, and they are self-selecting the facts, writing a fictional war story, and isolating themselves.

Is that strategy terrorism? It sure is.

The hatred is viral, and it’s growing more intense and more widespread. No? Do your research. Go to alt-right sites and forums. Read alt-right and militia group publications. My bet, we have about a year to get this under control, but I don’t think we can. Especially with Donald Trump at the top of the world, who has shown a terrifying willingness to ignore this problem entirely.

But this is only the first mass shooting carried out by a Muslim on Trump’s watch. And it’s small and isolated: four people over the course of a week. (Look out, America! Here comes Sharia law!) We haven’t seen a jihadist attack in America since October. Imagine what would happen if we have two more of these attacks in the next six months.

I don’t think it’s crazy—though it seems sadly cliched by now—to say that this mass, viral hatred on the part of impassioned minority members of the majority is exactly what incubated the holocaust. The reality of America today is that unchecked, uncensored hate speech is socially acceptable in public. More than that, actually: It’s mandated now, because Donald Trump won the presidency with a minority of the popular vote. “We had to be nice because of Obama,” so it goes. “Now look out.”

In the age of information self-selection, where you can simply click the facts that bother you away, how do you stop this? We race to compartmentalize a worldview before facts can shoot holes in it. The only facts that matter are the ones that immunize your worldview. But I’m not being PC, and I’m not apologizing for or defending terrorist violence: This wasn’t terrorism, according to the law, and you saying it was does not make it so. It only makes it worse.

“Allahu akbar!” isn’t evil. It’s the call to prayer. Imagine if white Christian murderers shouted “Thy kingdom come, thy will be done!” before they killed someone. It’s not a terrorist phrase, and it’s not the battle cry of Islam, though yes, evil people use it like that. But 99.999% of the time, Allahu akbar leads to something beautiful.

America, let’s not become the evil we deplore: Make Allah Akbar Again!",1

"FAR ROCKAWAY, QUEENS -- A group of Queens gang members could face years behind bars for turning neighborhood streets into war zones, attempting to shoot rivals that crossed into their territory and then bragging about it on social media, prosecutors said. A Queens County grand jury indicted nine members of the Wildmeda Crips Gang in Far Rockaway for allegedly plotting to shoot rival gang members in four failed murder attempts between 2015 and 2016. The defendants in this case are accused of turning neighborhood streets into violent war zones, where families and children are endangered simply by walking the streets of their community, said Queens District Attorney Richard Brown. A yearslong NYPD investigation into the gang members - who range from 20 to 29 years old - uncovered phone conversations in which top-ranking associates ordered subordinates to kill or injure rivals and get weapons to keep their territory free of rival gangs, according to the charges.

They referred to a guns as a situation, jawn, thoty, whoopty and b---h, charges state. The Wildmeda Crips targeted members of the 70Gs, SOS, Edgemere Bloods, Flammers and any other gang that crossed into their territory surrounding the Ocean Bay Housing Development, prosecutors said. They allegedly used guns, beatings and intimidation to maintain tight control over the area. Six of the nine gang members were arraigned Thursday on the 52-count indictment. Two others, including high-ranking member Kamel Cardwell, are already behind bars. Cops are still searching for the ninth member. If convicted, each faces maximums of 15-25 years in prison for the murder plots. Lead photo via Shutterstock.",0
"ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is proposing changes to the states hate crimes law following the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.

The Democratic governor announced Tuesday that hell introduce legislation making it a hate crime to riot or incite a riot that targets a specific class of people protected by anti-discrimination laws.

If approved by state lawmakers, Cuomos proposal would enhance criminal penalties for rioting that targets people because of their race, color, national origin, ancestry, religion, gender, age, disability or sexual orientation.

Cuomo says that while peaceful protests must be allowed, New York will not tolerate violence and discrimination.

He also wants to expand the human rights law to ensure public school students are covered following a court decision that schools were exempt from the law.",1
"MILWAUKEE, WI — Dramatic surveillance footage recorded in a Milwaukee George Webb restaurant captured a waitress heroic actions as she fended off an attacker by pulling a gun on him. And now that attacker - Raphael C. Calhoun, Jr. - has been arrested and charged in the crime with substantial battery. If convicted, Calhoun faces up to 18 months behind bars in addition to any fines he may face. According to the criminal complaint, Milwaukee Police were dispatched to the George Webbs restaurant on the evening of Friday, June 29 on a report that a man went behind the counter and assaulted a waitress. When police arrived, they talked with restaurant staff, who said that Calhoun became upset with the amount of time that it was taking for his food to be ready. When Calhoun demanded a refund and was not given one, the report states that he went into the kitchen of the restaurant, walked through it, and punched a waitress in the face. Police said the woman was treated at St. Lukes Hospital and was diagnosed with a severe concussion and sustained a laceration to her upper lip, and a bruise on her arm. In video that was released by the restaurant, a second waitress is seen pulling a gun from her apron and pointing it at Calhoun. He stops in his tracks and slowly retreats as the woman trains her gun on him and refuses to back down. According to the report, Milwaukee Alderman Bob Donovan, who was made aware of the incident which happened in his district, helped to release the footage in hopes of catching the suspect. Reports stated that the woman who pulled the gun had a concealed weapon permit. She quit her job that night. The restaurant released the following statement to ABC News. We were alerted to an incident that took place at our Mitchell Street location on June 29 and are working directly with the injured employee, store manager and franchise owner to review the events. The safety and security of our employees and patrons is our top priority.

"SOMERVILLE, MA – A 28-year-old man from Somerville was killed in the devastating weekend fire in an Oakland warehouse. Micah Danemayer was among 10 people authorities identified late Monday as victims. Danemayer, an electronic musician who performed under the name Paralycyst, was at the Ghost Ship with his girlfriend, 26-year-old Alana Jen Kane. As of Monday night, Kane remained missing.

"BUFFALO GROVE, IL - An 18-year-old man from Mundelein has been arrested in connection to an aggravated robbery incident at the CVS Pharmacy on Dundee Road in Buffalo Grove earlier this year. Buffalo Grove police have charged Sergio Erick Conejo-Valerio with aggravated robbery, according to a report from the Buffalo Grove Countryside. He was arrested on Nov. 9 for the incident that happened on Jan. 28. Previous reports indicate the robbery occurred at about 3:50 a.m. at the CVS Pharmacy, 20 E. Dundee Road in Buffalo Grove. Authorities said the same two suspects from an earlier robbery at a nearby Mobil gas station entered the store and ordered the clerk to open the cash register.

"The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University at San Bernardino reports that hate crimes increased by roughly 20 percent in the 13 largest U.S. cities in 2017 compared to 2016.

Hate Crimes Against Muslims Up 67%

Much of America’s hatred has been directed at Muslims. The FBI reports that hate crimes against Muslims increased by 67 percent in 2015 and by 20 percent in 2016.

President Donald Trump’s xenophobic policies and tweet-rhetoric has effectively legitimized hatred against Muslims and other minorities among a large swath of white America. Last July, the Houston office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) reported that hate crimes against Muslims increased by 91 percent in the first half of 2017 compared to 2016. CAIR attributed the increase “to the Trump campaign and presidency.” The group pointed out that 37 percent of the attacks were directed at children in schools.

Trump Leads Demonization of Muslims

In the April 8, 2018 edition of Truthdig, Chris Hedges, a Pulitzer-prize winning journalist, offered this explanation for the American hatred of Muslims: “Muslims are branded as irrational and inclined to violence and terrorism by their religious beliefs. We attack them not for what they do but because we see them as being different from us. We must eradicate them to save ourselves. And thus we perpetuate the very hatred and counter violence, or terrorism, that we fear.”

In August 2016 Aljazeera reporter, Patrick Strickland, wrote that Texas politicians and law enforcement agencies were slow to respond to growing threat of violence faced by the state’s Muslim population. Alia Salem, the executive director of the Dallas-Fort Worth chapter of CAIR, told the news network that “the [Texas] Muslim community is feeling so threatened right now … All hell’s breaking loose.”

With President Trump’s amped up xenophobic rhetoric of hatred, the situation for Muslims, both here in Texas and across the nation, has worsened.

On March 26, 2018, Univision reported that there have been “dozens of hate-fueled attacks, mostly against Latinos and Muslims, reported at Walmart stores nationwide” in recent months. ProPublica’s Documenting Hate Project found that hate-driven attacks against Muslims and other minorities have also increased at other superstores, like Costco, Target and Sam’s Club.

Hatred lies deep in the American soul. Most Americans understand this.

An October 2017 Pew Research Center study found that 61 percent of the people in this country believe America needs to “continue making changes to give blacks equal rights with whites …”

This racial generosity, however, does not always extend to Muslims. A 2011 Gallup poll found that 52 percent of Americans do not respect Muslims.

Right Wing Fear Mongering Against “Radical Islam”

The President of this country, and his Chief of Staff (John Kelly), have expressed publicly that they do not understand what has been media-dubbed as “radical Islam,” words that have become the dog whistle for bigoted white supremacist.

In a 2013 speech, Gen. Kelly had this to say about Muslims: “I don’t know why they hate us, and I frankly don’t care, but they do hate us and are driven irrationally to our destruction.”

And therein lie the reason for the hate-driven American war on Muslims—white men do not like to be hated but it is an integral component of white men like Gen. Kelly to hate others, and this hatred has reared its ugly head often as the President and General grapple with how to deal with Democratic ideals this nation professes to cherish. The sad truth is that these two leaders are real life expressions of white America’s long-standing hatred of non-whites perceived as a threat to their supremacy.

Islamophobia Byproduct of White Supremacy

As Khaled Beydoun, a law professor and author of the book called American Islamophobia: Understanding the Roots and Rise of Fear, points out: fear and hatred of Muslims and Islam have “deep roots in American history.”

In an April 6, 2018 Vox edition, Beydoun told Alexia Underwood that Islamophobia is actually a byproduct of “white supremacy.”

Still, writing in the February 21, 2018 edition of Huffington Post, Bisma Parvez offered this encouragement: “Muslims in America are just as American as everyone else. We are more alike than different. We have the same hopes and dreams, the same fears and worries.”

That would be the ideal America. But, unfortunately, the President of the United States and the leader of the Western World prefers to promote racial divisions both here and abroad to advance his personal, political agenda.

As long as we have a white supremacist ideology endorsed by our American president and his most trusted advisors, and as long as Fox News continues to legitimize this racist-driven ideology to a significant portion of the white population in the United States, there will be a war waged against Muslims, Latinos, African-Americans and other “others” in this country.

Perhaps this war of hatred will one day end, but not, we fear, in the foreseeable future.",1

The World’s Borough saw the largest increase in reported anti-Jewish acts in the city last year, rocketing to 39 from 11 in 2016, according to the Anti-Defamation League’s annual Audit of Anti-Semitic Incidents.

By Michael V. Cusenza

A bill recently introduced in the Assembly by a borough pol would establish a hate crimes prevention training program for Empire State law enforcement agencies.

According to its sponsor, Assemblywoman Nily Rozic (D-Flushing), the proposed measure directs the State Division of Criminal Justice Services to develop a training program and associated training materials, to provide instruction and information to State and local police forces on the recognition of and response to hate crimes.

Assemblywoman Stacey Pheffer Amato (D-Howard Beach) and Assemblyman David Weprin (D-Fresh Meadows) have co-sponsored the legislation.

“This training is essential to ensure that law enforcement officers are prepared to handle, and hopefully prevent, hate crimes,” Pheffer Amato said this week as she urged her colleagues to quickly approve A.10023. “In a state as diverse as ours, we must lead the fight in hate-crime prevention.”

The bill is under review in the Assembly Committee on Governmental Operations.

Earlier this month, the Anti-Defamation League released an audit that indicated that the number of anti-Jewish incidents reported in the city last year surged by more than 90 percent compared to 2016; and of all five boroughs, Queens saw the largest increase in such acts in 2017, swelling to 39 from 11 in 2016.",1

Asian Americans are watching the cruelty of President Trump’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy with shock and horror as children stripped from the arms of parents seeking asylum are placed in detention facilities as court-ordered deadlines for reunification are missed and a blur of chaos greets cries for information.

But the perception of the cruelty might be different for the Asian Pacific Islander (API) community, which has experience with previous U.S. zero-tolerance immigration policies from the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 to the Japanese American internment camps ordered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt after Pearl Harbor. Their empathy is deep and intersectional, knowing that at least Japanese American children were allowed to stay with their parents behind the barbed wire fences.

“It’s been an extremely difficult time under this administration for LGBT immigrants and racial minorities,” Glenn D. Magpantay, National Queer Asian Pacific Islander Alliance (NQAPIA) executive director, tells the Los Angeles Blade. “The fear mongering that the Trump administration has put out there—and the policies based on fear and hate—is appalling.”

NQAPIA notes that LGBT youth have been particularly impacted by Trump’s policies. “We filed a brief at the U.S. Supreme Court to show how the Muslim travel ban tears apart LGBT Muslim families,” he says. Additionally, “the stakes are higher for LGBT DACA kids” after Trump’s cancelation of DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals). “They won’t just be deported—they’ll be deported to countries that criminalize or persecute LGBTQ people. So it’s not just a deportation—it’s going to jail or torture.”

There are a litany of issues, Magpantay says. “Our community is suffering under this administration.”

NQAPIA is fighting back, “relentless in speaking out,” joining marches and rallies, lobbying Congress about the DREAM Act, suing the administration over the Muslim travel ban and sanctuary cities — “using all the tools in our arsenal to protect the LGBT API community.”

But Magpantay notes that LGBT immigrants harbor what to them seems like justifiable fears, even in sanctuary cities with laws to prevent Immigration Enforcement (ICE) from coming into a home and rounding up immigrants.

“For LGBTQ immigrants, ICE is our hate group,” Magpantay says. In states such as California, Texas and Illinois that have laws to protect LGBTQ people—hate crime laws, domestic violence laws. “We have access to courts, to services. We have rights as LGBTQ people. But when ICE is there – we cannot access those protections because there’s fear.”

LGBTQ immigrants won’t go to court to get a retraining order against an abusive same sex husband. “You have the right to a restraining order—but have to go to court to get it. You cannot do that,” he says. “Or you’re a victim of an anti-gay bashing. You need to go to the police station to file a report. But you think: I’m an immigrant. Will they report me to ICE if I report my gay bashing?”

And, Magpantay says, it doesn’t matter what kind of an immigrant you are. “Those who have lived in this country, loved this country, have worked in the LGBT community have been told you don’t belong. No matter how long you’ve been here, no matter what visa you get, not matter what you have done to build up our LGBTQ community,” he says, “the administration is saying ‘Get away from America,’ again. This administration has policies of hate and scapegoating.”

“This is the greatest fear,” however, is that Republicans will control the three branches of government with no recourse for minorities. “There would be no balance of power and we will suffer from a tyranny under unchecked power,” Magpantay says.

But NQAPIA hopes to enhance their political participation, bringing LGBT Asians from across the US and activists from Japan, China, Vietnam, Bangladesh, India, and Malaysia to strategize, organize and mobilize. The occasion is the organization’s triennial national conference from July 26 to 29 In San Francisco. More than 400 LGBTQ APIs are expected, with international speakers and 100 workshops on racial justice, immigrants’ rights, LGBTQ equality, trans justice, philanthropy, religious acceptance, youth organizing, among other issues.

This is no small matter. Asians are the fastest growing minority in the U.S., according to the Pew Research Center. “The U.S. Asian population grew 72% between 2000 and 2015 (from 11.9 million to 20.4 million), the fastest growth rate of any major racial or ethnic group. By comparison, the population of the second-fastest growing group, Hispanics, increased 60% during the same period,” Pew reported Sept. 8, 2017. “In 50 years, Asians will make up 38% of all U.S. immigrants, while Hispanics will make up 31% of the nation’s immigrant population.”

Meanwhile, “Asian unauthorized immigrants made up about 13% of the 11.1 million unauthorized immigrants who live in the U.S.,” Pew reports.

In September 2013, the Williams Institute estimated that 325,000 or 2.8% of all API adults in the U.S. identified as LGBT. That was five years ago—one reason NQAPIA will fight the “citizen question” on the upcoming census and educate LGBT APIs to come out.

“For too long our needs have gone unmet. For too long, we have been marginalized,” Magpantay says. The conference will help develop ideas on how LGBT APIs can achieve greater fundraising skills and political representation. They’ve seen confrontations before. “We must act with love and solidarity,” Magpantay says. “We must support each other and move together.”

"The Columbus Division of Police say there’s no evidence that a weekend altercation which left a Somali woman’s face injured is a hate crime.

Rahma Warsame’s face is visibly damaged from the incident that happened Saturday in her apartment complex on Pinellas Court in northeast Columbus. Warsame was treated for injuries at a nearby hospital. Police say conflicting witness stories left them unable to determine who the primary aggressor was in the incident that left Warsame bruised.

“There was no indication that there were any kind of threats made or that this was ethnically or any other way biased,” Columbus Police Sergeant Rich Weiner says. “There’s no indication whatsoever that this was a hate crime.”

But Warsame says that’s not true.

“He keep saying ‘Africans you guys go back to Africa. I’m gonna ship you, I’m gonna kill you.’ He was saying that when he was chasing,” Warsame says. “’I’m gonna kill everybody,’ even when policeman was there, ‘I’m gonna kill everybody.’”

Romin Iqbal, the legal director for Council on American-Islamic Relations in Columbus, says law enforcement did not investigate thoroughly, and demands someone be charged.

“Our client simply showed up there to intervene, to stop an argument and got viciously assaulted for that. And that’s not fair,” Iqbal says.

But police say they have done due diligence.

“We did investigate the incident. Officers arrived on the scene, we spoke to multiple people that were involved in the incident,” Weiner says. “Two women were transported to the hospital in stable condition. Others reported that they were assaulted as well but they were not transported.”

Weiner says the injuries were misdemeanors, so it is up to the victims to file charges at the city prosecutor’s office.

A fundraiser through LaunchGood has raised more than $100,000 in support of Warsame, after the incident quickly garnered traction on social media.",1
"A man who walked up to a stranger with a large rock and struck him over the head in downtown Berkeley on Tuesday has been charged with hate crime allegations and two felonies related to the attack, authorities report.

Jeffrey Frazier Pachingger, who is 38 and homeless, told police he hit the victim with a rock “because of ‘an illegal Asian takeover,” according to court papers.

The victim, an Asian man, lost “a large amount of blood” and was taken to the hospital after the attack. Police wrote in court papers that Pachingger, who is Hispanic, said he tried to kill the man “because of his ethnicity and his belief of an ‘Asian takeover.”

Thursday, the Alameda County district attorney’s office charged Pachingger, who already was on probation, with assault with a deadly weapon — a rock — and battery with serious bodily injury. Both counts include a special allegation that identifies them as hate crimes. Pachingger could be sent to prison if convicted.

According to court papers, the victim was at Shattuck Avenue and Center Street at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday and had bent down to unlock his bike when Pachingger “grabbed a rock, walked towards the victim from behind and hit him in the back of the head.”

The man “felt dizzy and thought he was going to lose consciousness,” police wrote, but he managed to run away because he was afraid Pachingger would strike him again.

First responders found the victim on Shattuck Avenue and Berkeley Square. There was a laceration and bruising to his head, and paramedics took him to Alta Bates Hospital for treatment.

Pachingger, meanwhile, walked down to the Berkeley Police Department, several blocks west, and admitted to have hit the man, police wrote. He also made statements admitting to racial animus in the attack, according to court papers.

As of Thursday, Pachingger remains in custody. He is scheduled to enter a plea Friday at the Rene C. Davidson Courthouse in Oakland.

"Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, author of “From #BlackLivesMatter to Black Liberation” and assistant professor of African American studies at Princeton University, was supposed to give an anticipated Town Hall talk on her new book last week. But she was forced to cancel at the last hour due to threats spawned by a Fox News smear campaign.

“I have been repeatedly called ‘nigger,’ ‘bitch,’ ‘cunt,’ ‘dyke,’ ‘she-male,’ and ‘coon’ — a clear reminder that racial violence is closely aligned with gender and sexual violence,” Taylor wrote on her publisher’s Facebook page. “I have been threatened with lynching and having the bullet from a .44 Magnum put in my head.”

The vitriol became so violent and so profuse she feared for her safety and the safety of her family.

Taylor’s longtime friend Jesse Hagopian, a Seattle educator and activist, was supposed to introduce her Town Hall talk. Hagopian was deeply upset to find out about the threats being made against her.

“You know I’ve faced stuff before but this definitely feels like a different moment,” reflected Hagopian who recently settled a lawsuit against the Seattle Police after being pepper-sprayed by an officer unprovoked. “I feel like the incidents of hate crimes are mushrooming and out of control.”

Events like these are becoming disturbingly familiar in these times helmed by a doggedly conservative administration and president who openly insults, abuses and diminishes marginalized people without consequence. The license to brazenly act out hatred has been renewed. It is telling that this scene keeps playing itself out in the so-called progressive Pacific Northwest.

The Pacific Northwest has seen a substantial share of headline-making hate since the nation’s fateful election this fall. In January, the Islamic Center of the Eastside was burned to the ground. In February a bomb threat forced the evacuation of Stroum Jewish Community Center on Mercer Island. Temple De Hirsch Sinai, one of Seattle’s largest synagogues, was vandalized with graffiti denying the Holocaust denial in March.

Last Friday in Olympia, The Evergreen State College was evacuated after a racially motivated death threat. And of course it was only three weeks ago in Portland that a white supremacist harassing two young Black women (one wearing a hijab) fatally stabbed two men who came to their defense.

But these are only the incidents we hear about. Many people are enduring everyday, escalating hate that is never reported or known. Right after the election, for instance, Globalist writer and activist Reagan Jackson was shopping for groceries at her local store when she was repeatedly called the n-word by another shopper.

“He was looking directly at me,” Jackson said of the scruffy white man who targeted her. “Once I looked [back] at him he gave me a big smile like he was so proud of himself for getting to call me a nigger.”

While she did not feel she was in physical danger, Jackson confessed she did feel “dirty” and it took her a while to start shopping in that store again; a place she had been shopping at for five years without incident.

Just a week before inauguration, South Asian author and journalist Ruchika Tulshyan was stopped at Sea-Tac International Airport while traveling alone with her infant son. Being a brown woman Tulshyan is often stopped by Transportation Security Administration for questioning. But this time was different. Officers were suspicious of her sealed bottles of commercial formula and insisted she open them (which would have contaminated the formula so she could not feed or son) — or be pat down. Tulshyan chose the latter and endured a 20-minute public pat down which ended with her in tears.

“They touched every part of my body,” she remembered. “It was a very humiliating experience.”

Rita Meher, founder and director of South Asian film festival Tasveer, said her greater Seattle community is indeed under increasing strife.

Meher said one of her South Asian friends was recently driving a little slower than the speed limit when another driver suddenly blocked him with their car and hatefully upbraided, “If you can’t drive get out of this country! Go back to your f-ing country.”

Meher said another South Asian woman in Fremont was slapped on the street in broad daylight after a stranger chided, “You people drive nice cars, take away our jobs. Go back to your country!”

The evening of Taylor’s canceled talk Hagopian went to his son’s baseball game at Rainier Playfield thinking he would at least relax. But instead he found himself intervening when a police officer began harassing a nearby Black youth suspected of stealing a cellphone.

“The kid is like shaking and crying,” Hagopian said. The police backed down when community members stepped up. But the harassing officer walked away unapologetically.

“Well at least I didn’t handcuff him or detain him,” Hagopian recalled the officer saying.

Hagopian said the incident was terrifying.

Despite the Pacific Northwest’s proud billing of itself as a bastion of left liberal thinking, these devastating incidents easily upend any notion that this region has better racial outcomes than others. It clearly does not. And the situation is not improving.

“From my daily reality the police have not changed in this city,” Hagopian said plainly, adding the Trump administration has made things far worse.

Reagan Jackson is well aware of the bias that has always existed in the Pacific Northwest veiled by the pretense of appearing progressive. The change, she pointed out, is that under the current administration that pretense is dropping.

“There’s this permissiveness: ‘Oh actually I can call you a nigger,’” Jackson said. “‘I’ve been thinking it the whole time but now . . . it’s open season. Fuck you, nigger.’” And like Hagopian, she also believes hate is escalating.

The data does not lie. As recently as 2015 King County, Washington, was the whitest large county to be found across all fifty states. Portland — founded as a racist white haven — is still holding out as the whitest city in the entire nation, obviously by design.

Additionally, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center’s website, Washington state currently has the seventh highest number of reported hate incidents — which is a conservative estimate.

And according to a new data-gathering project by ProPublica, Oregon residents have the highest per capita rate of reported hate crimes and bias incidents of all.

This rise in hate is terrorism against minority communities in Pacific Northwest and throughout the United States.

“There’s so much local terrorism in this country now. It’s our own people who are brainwashed and xenophobic and anti-Muslim,” Meher said.

Tulshyan agreed.

“We’ve seen it play out in so many ways not the least of which is the Portland stabbing.”

Additionally Tulshyan, a founding editor of The Establishment, said overt bias is seeping into the language of liberals and progressives, further legitimizing hatred towards non-white communities in the region.

Last weekend Portland was tense in the wake of the stabbing as pro- and anti-Trump rallies faced off on the same day. This weekend it will be Seattle’s turn as a planned anti-Muslim rally (which moved from Portland after having their permit revoked) will be counter-rallied by Seattle Stands With Our Muslim Neighbors.

Even though the escalating hate is scary, say local leaders of color, it remains more important than ever to center those most impacted and stand resolute in resistance.

“We’ve got to keep pushing [back],” said Hagopian.

“It’s blatant, it’s gross and shouldn’t happen,” Meher said.

Yet, Meher also observed that “people are getting more and more political, starting to speak up about it, when they weren’t political before.”

“I’m not having it,” Jackson said staunchly. “I will do whatever I need to do to assert my rights . . . I’m not interested in being victimized in this way. It’s not American frankly.”

Former University of Hartford student Brianna Brochu, 18. (West Hartford Police Department/AP)

A former student at the University of Hartford has been charged with criminal mischief and breach of peace after bragging online about contaminating her roommate’s belongings with bodily fluids, including rubbing dirty tampons on her backpack and putting her toothbrush “places where the sun doesn’t shine.”

Eighteen-year-old Brianna Brochu appeared in court Wednesday. A judge banned her from the campus in central Connecticut and ordered her not to have any contact with her former dormitory roommate, Chennel Rowe, pending the conclusion of the case, according to the Hartford Courant.

Authorities told the Courant that Brochu, who is white, also faces a hate-crime charge stemming from the alleged actions against her roommate, who is black.

Last month, Brochu allegedly wrote on Instagram that she finally “got rid of her roommate,” whom she referred to as “Jamaican Barbie.”

“After 1½ month of spitting in her coconut oil, putting moldy clam dip in her lotions, rubbing used tampons [on] her backpack, putting her toothbrush places where the sun doesn’t shine, and so much more, I can finally say goodbye Jamaican Barbie,” the post read, according to court records obtained by Heavy.

According to the arrest warrant affidavit, Brochu posted pictures, including one of a bag stained with a “reddish brown substance” that she later acknowledged was “period blood,” one of a food container filled with a milky substance and one of hair extensions with the caption, “This b—- legit bought a box of f—ing hair.”

[Three Dartmouth professors accused of sexual misconduct]

University of Hartford President Greg Woodward said in a letter Wednesday to the campus community that following the “deeply disturbing situation,” Brochu is no longer a student at the school. He said the university took immediate action once it learned about the allegations, notifying campus authorities and the West Hartford Police Department, which opened an investigation on Oct. 18.

Police did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Brochu was arrested Saturday after telling police that she started to lash out at Rowe after she posted videos of Brochu sleeping and teasing her for snoring, according to court documents.

She told police that she did lick Rowe’s “plate, fork and spoon,” rub a used tampon on her backpack and mix Rowe’s lotions together, but she said that everything else she bragged about online was not true, according to the arrest warrant affidavit.

Brochu had not yet been assigned an attorney in the case.

Rowe recounted the ordeal Monday in a Facebook Live video, saying that she had been experiencing throat pain for weeks and did not know why. She told police earlier this month that a nurse had advised her she had a “bacteria present in her throat” and Rowe suspected it was caused by “Brochu tampering with her personal items,” according to the arrest warrant affidavit.

Rowe said in the Facebook video that she learned about Brochu’s social media post when she was approached by a former neighbor and two resident assistants as she was switching dorm rooms.

The university president called the incident “deeply upsetting.”

“One of our students was the alleged victim of bullying and her story was shared across social media,” Woodward said Tuesday in a letter to the campus.

“The incident has brought about accusations of racism, and I want you to know that I hear and share your anger and frustration,” he said. “Acts of racism, bias, bullying, or other abusive behaviors will not be tolerated on this campus. I pledge to do everything in my power to work with our community to address related concerns together.”

Woodward said the University of Hartford “is not exempt from issues facing our society and world” and encouraged others to come forward with concerns.

“We must strive every day to practice understanding, tolerance, inclusion, and grace,” he said. “I know that you will join me in this critical mission.”

The Bowie State University commencement saw the conferral of degrees to nearly 700 students, but it was the one who wasn’t here, whose empty chair was draped with a graduation gown, who was on everyone’s mind.

Richard Collins III was honored at the Bowie State Universitys graduation ceremony just days after he was fatally stabbed while visiting friends at the University of Maryland.

The 23-year-old from Calvert County was murdered, in what police are calling a possible hate crime, while waiting for an Uber with his friends early Saturday morning.

University of Maryland student Sean Christopher Urbanski, 22, of Severna Park, has been charged with first and second-degree murder and first-degree assault in the case.

The first degree presented at Tuesdays Bowie State ceremony was handed to the still grieving but also grateful father of Lt. Collins.

Also honoring the murdered student, a chair was staged at the ceremony with Collins graduation gown.

Collins was a member of Bowie State’s ROTC program and had just been commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in the U.S. Army on Thursday.



A ceremony was also held at the University of Maryland in honor of Collins.

Please call in TODAY, Friday Sept 14th, to Pennsylvania Governor Wolf, state senator and representatives, Lt. Governor Candidate (and Gov. Wolf’s Running Mate) John Fetterman and PA Department of Corrections (DOC) Secretary Wetzel to protest outrageous new punitive DOC policies that will impinge on prisoner’s rights and those of their families.

NPR KATIE MEYER, BYLINE: Last week, Pennsylvania’s corrections department locked down all 25 of its state prisons. Prisoners were more or less confined to their cells 24 hours a day. And though individual prisons have started relaxing procedures somewhat, the lockdown is still in place. Now Governor Tom Wolf says they’re taking another extreme action.

"NORRISTOWN, PA — The officer who shot an armed suspect in Norristown late last month has been cleared of wrongdoing in the incident, following an investigation by the Montgomery County District Attorneys Office. The incident took place on Feb. 27 at around 11:23 a.m. on the 200 block of E. Chestnut Street, where police were called to the scene of a fight. When they arrived they identified one of the men involved, 29-year-old Damar Coleman, who they said they were familiar with. Coleman was holding a gun.

"The Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authoritys bus driver union voted to bring in an arbitrator in connection with the firing of a bus driver involved in a physical altercation with a passenger last year. Artis Hughes was fired Nov. 6 after an altercation witha female passenger that ended with an uppercut. A video of Hughes uppercutting a passenger in Beachwood went viral on the web. The RTA said that Hughes actions were not in accordance with the companys policies, and he has been charged with assault in connection with the altercation. The passenger, Shidea Lane, has also been charged with disorderly conduct. Amalgamated Transit Union Local 268 President William Nix said that the members approved the measure to seek arbitration unanimously. According to the union contract, this arbitration will be binding — so the third partys decision will stand. We would love for him to get his job back, said Nix. He should be made whole. He added that Hughes firing sent a bad message and was followed by other assaults on bus drivers. Anyone who wants to get away with something, you can just go out and attack a bus driver and you wont get caught and you wont get arrested. In October, the RTA reported that there had been 71 assaults on drivers in the past 5 years.

"COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) - Lawyers for the man charged with murder and a hate crime in the fatal stabbing of a black student in Maryland have asked a judge to exclude evidence tying him to a Facebook page called Alt-Reich: Nation.

A new version of a Trump administration travel ban will not stop green card holders or travelers already on planes from entering the United States, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly said. (Volkan Furuncu – Anadolu Agency)

The number of anti-Muslim hate crimes rose 91 percent in the first half of the year compared with the same period in 2016, a leading Muslim advocacy group said Monday.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said the number of hate crimes spiked from the corresponding period of 2016, which was the worst year for anti-Muslim incidents since the civil rights organization began its current documenting system in 2013.

According to the report, the number of bias incidents in the first half of 2017 also rose by 24 percent on year.

“The presidential election campaign and the Trump administration have tapped into a seam of bigotry and hate that has resulted in the targeting of American Muslims and other minority groups,” said Zainab Arain, coordinator in CAIR’s Department to Monitor and Combat Islamophobia.

“If acts of bias impacting the American Muslim community continue as they have been, 2017 could be one of the worst years ever for such incidents.”

The most frequent type of incidents documented by CAIR in the second quarter of 2017 involved harassment, defined as a non-violent or non-threatening incident. The second most common type of bias incidents were hate crimes and involved physical violence or property damage.

CAIR said the most prevalent trigger of anti-Muslim bias incidents in 2017 remains the victim’s ethnicity or national origin, accounting for 32 percent of the total.

“Twenty percent of incidents occurred because of an individual being perceived as Muslim. A Muslim woman’s headscarf was a trigger in 15 percent of incidents,” it added.

The report dataset is drawn primarily from the intakes CAIR conducts each year. With each case, civil rights and legal staff seek to ensure the highest possible level of accuracy.

According to CAIR’s 2016 report, anti-Muslim hate incidents rose over 40 percent compared to 2015, with a 44 percent increase in hate crimes targeting Muslims as well as a 57 percent increase in anti-Muslim bias incidents during that time.

"A 52-year-old man pleaded guilty Tuesday to charges of fatally shooting an engineer from India at a Kansas bar and wounding two others, according to the Johnson County District Attorney’s Office. He had pleaded not guilty in November, according to The Associated Press.

Adam Purinton entered his guilty plea in Johnson County District Court to premeditated first-degree murder in the death of 32-year-old Srinivas Kuchibhotla, an aviation systems engineer and programs manager at GPS maker Garmin.

Purinton also pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted premeditated first-degree murder for injuring Kuchibhotla’s friend Alok Madasani, also from India, and Ian Grillot, who tried to intervene during the shooting at Austins Bar and Grill in Olathe, Kansas, last February, the district attorney said.

“Today’s guilty verdict in the murder of my husband will not bring back my Srinu, but it will send a strong message that hate is never acceptable,” Sunayana Dumala, Kuchibhotla’s wife, said in a statement. “We must understand and love one another.”

Purinton — who still faces federal hate crime charges and possibly the death penalty — is accused of opening fire after using “racial slurs” and yelling “get out of my country,” The AP and Kansas City Star have reported.

It wasn’t immediately clear how or if his plea will affect charges being brought by the federal government.

Purinton’s attorney did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

The district attorney’s office said in a statement that the parties agreed to a maximum sentence on each count to run consecutive to one another and to any sentence imposed in the federal case. Purinton would have to serve 50 years before being eligible for parole, according to the district attorneys office.

Purinton’s sentencing is scheduled for May 4.

A peace walk is planned to honor Kuchibhotla on Friday, which would’ve been his birthday, Dumala said.

“Let us continue to work for peace, understanding and love — the things Srinu stood for and will be his legacy,” she said.

"When Utah Sen. Daniel Thatcher introduced his hate crime bill in last year’s legislative session, it didn’t even get a public hearing.

Now, the Republican senator is hoping a resolution the West Jordan City Council passed Wednesday night could show the Legislature it needs to make changes in 2018 to the state’s current hate crime law, which Thatcher called “literally unenforceable.”

“Last year, we didn’t have the policy conversation,” he said. “Last year, the argument was made that there’s no interest in this issue. Well, I think cities and counties can help us settle that argument. I believe there is interest in this issue. I believe our cities and counties can help us make that clear.”

The city joined groups like the Statewide Association of Prosecutors, the Utah Chiefs of Police Association, the Utah Sheriffs’ Association and others that have already expressed support for the Legislature to act. West Jordan Councilman Dirk Burton said he’s heard other cities may follow suit but said he was unable to substantiate the rumors.

Invoking the protection in the U.S. Constitution of “mankind’s unalienable rights,” the city’s resolution offers support for “providing law enforcement stronger tools to address crime that deliberately targets a victim because of race, religion, sexual orientation, national origin, or disability.”

The resolution passed 5-2, with Councilman Chad Nichols and Councilman David Newton voting in opposition.

“I am grateful that West Jordan looked at an issue where they could easily have said, ‘That’s a state problem,’ and they recognized that, in this instance, West Jordan’s leadership could make a difference,” Thatcher said after the council voted. “They stepped up. They were brave, and I’m proud tonight of West Jordan.”

Equality Utah also has expressed support for legislative action on hate crimes. Troy Williams, the organization’s director, also praised West Jordan and said he hopes its resolution can spur statewide consensus on the issue.

“It’s beautiful that a community like West Jordan can come together and take a stand for love and inclusion and acceptance,” Williams said. “We hope that other cities and counties will follow. The nation is so divided right now on so many issues, but we can all agree that no one should be targeted and no one should be the victim of violence just because of who they are.”

No one has been prosecuted for a hate-based crime in Utah in the 20 years the statute has been in place, Williams said.

Steve Jones, a West Jordan resident, was the only person to speak on the resolution during public comment and expressed concern over changing the state’s current law.

“There’s a law against assaulting people; that should be treated the same regardless of why that individual assaulted,” he said. “To put an extra protection for a handful of items is wrong.”

Thatcher, however, said that concerns about hate crime legislation offering some people protection and not others are unfounded.

“The gentleman who spoke was correct,” Thatcher said before the council. “Any solution that comes forward must offer equal protection under the law. It can’t protect one race and not another. It must protect all races. It must protect all religions.”

Thatcher plans to introduce a hate crime bill in the 2018 Legislature similar to the one he brought in 2017.

His failed to get a hearing. A similar hate crime bill former Sen. Steve Urquhart, R-St. George, proposed in the 2016 legislative session failed in the Senate on a 17-11 vote. Urquhart told The Tribune at the time that he believed opposition from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had ultimately killed his bill.

FBI Hate Crime Statistics from 2015, which contain data from 14,997 law enforcement agencies, show more than 12,700 offenses that year were motivated “by bias against race, ethnicity, ancestry, sexual orientation, disability, gender and gender identity.”

Of the 59 bias-related crimes reported in 2015 to Utah’s Bureau of Criminal Identification, 33 were related to race — with white victims the primary target — and 14 were related to religion, according to past reporting from The Salt Lake Tribune. Ten bias crimes were perpetrated against victims from the LGBT community, data show.

Though Thatcher said Utah has been “very lucky” to have a relatively small number of hate crimes, he said it’s still important for the state Legislature to ensure an enforceable law makes it on the books in case an issue does occur.

“What happens when there is something and we do need enhanced penalties and we can’t apply them?” he said. “What does that do to the peace and the security of our community? If we have an honest-to-goodness, legitimate crime in the state of Utah where we need this law and it doesn’t exist yet, then it’s going to get worse before it gets better. I’d like to head that off.”",1

The post on Saturday came before the accuser publicly revealed her identity.,1
"By James Cullum | jcullum@alextimes.com

Alexandria police are investigating incendiary fliers found posted on utility poles and car windshields Saturday morning in Del Ray and Old Town. City leaders responded swiftly to condemn the fliers, which contained threatening racist and anti-Semitic language.

Alexandria Mayor Allison Silberberg denounced the fliers and those who posted them, saying neither are representative of the city.

“The fliers are horrible and reflect a new low in ignorance,” she said. “The Alexandria Police Department has responded quickly and is investigating. At this point, we do not know who posted the fliers. As the city council and I stated in our Statement on Inclusiveness last November, I would like to say in the strongest possible terms that we denounce hate speech, hate crimes and discrimination in all forms.

“Alexandria is a city of kindness and compassion,” Silberberg continued. “We are a city that is inclusive, accepting and embracing. Diversity is a core value here. We as a community are far stronger than a few fliers, and we will remain steadfast in our commitment to these values, which we hold so dear. Shame on those who have posted these hateful fliers… Such acts do not reflect the values of our beloved community and nation.”

“The signs are obviously very disturbing, but the people who posted them underestimate our neighborhood and our city,” said Alexandria Vice Mayor Justin Wilson. “They will not divide us. We will not give them more attention than they deserve, and instead focus on what brings us together.”

Alexandria police have released no information on the culprits behind the signage, but one of the signs had a mugshot-like photo of C. Christine Fair, an associate professor at Georgetown University, who confronted alt-right leader Richard Spencer at the Sport and Health in Old Town at 209 Madison St., on May 17. Spencer, who denied his identity when confronted by the woman, was later kicked out of the gym while Fair was allowed to keep her membership.

In Del Ray, the posters were found between Commonwealth and Mount Vernon Avenues and East Uhler and East Custis Avenues. It is not clear where the fliers were posted in Old Town.

“It’s still a very initial investigation,” said Alexandria Police spokeswoman Crystal Nosal. “Officers took down fliers that they saw and responded to complaints from residents and the investigation is ongoing.”

Reba Smith Winstead lives in Del Ray and shared the photos of the fliers throughout the community.

“This is not [what] Del Ray is,” she said. “Del Ray is very inclusive, and this type of racist aggression is not who we are.”

Delegate Mark Levine (D-45), called the signage a “shocking wake up call.”

“I have spoken at many protests against Richard Spencer and his disgusting neo-Nazi band of followers,” he said. “My only solace is that I believe they littered our city with this hate-filled trash as a reaction by them to their knowing how unwelcome in Alexandria they are. Hopefully they will soon have enough and leave.”

City Councilor John Chapman said that the city will be tested by the incidents.

“I hope community members will use this outrageous and disturbing incident to form tighter bonds with their neighbors, and hope Alexandria is an inclusive city that won’t be rattled by immature acts of hate,” he said.",1
"A Washington, D.C., man has died following a single-car crash Saturday night in Anne Arundel County that police say was likely caused by the drivers use of alcohol and driving too fast.

"Police said the death of Muslim teen Nabra Hassanen was not being investigated as a hate crime, but instead, as an incident of road rage. Hassanen’s body was discovered Sunday afternoon in a Virginia pond after the teen went missing following an altercation in the early hours that morning.

Hassanen and a group of friends were walking and biking to a nearby mosque after having eaten a large meal before beginning to fast for Ramadan when they were approached by a red car, police said. Darwin Martinez-Torres reportedly got into an argument with the group of teens and drove his car up onto the curb, causing the teens to scatter. In the ensuing confusion, he abducted Hassanen and assaulted her with a baseball bat, police said.

“There was no indication of any racial slurs or any back and forth other than a verbal argument,” Police Lieutenant Bryan Holland said Monday.

After realizing they could not locate Hassanen, her friends contacted authorities. After a subsequent search involving police dogs, helicopters and officers from two counties, Hassanen’s body was found in a pond about three miles from the scene of the original confrontation. Although all the teens present at the time were wearing Muslim head coverings and robes, police said it did not appear as though a hate crime took place.

“Nothing indicates that this was motivated by race or by religion,” Fairfax County police spokeswoman Julie Parker said at a news conference Monday. “It appears the suspect became so enraged over this traffic encounter that it escalated into deadly violence.

Police found Martinez-Torres driving suspiciously near the scene of the encounter. Officers declined to say why they became suspicious of him or what evidence they recovered but arrested him at the scene.

“His anger over that earlier encounter then led to violence when he hit Nabra with a baseball bat,” said Parker.

Many, however, have said they don’t believe the alleged murder was not motivated by religion.

“He killed her because she’s a Muslim – this is what I tell the detective,” said Hassanen’s father, according to the Washington Post. “Why was he running behind the kids wearing Islamic clothes with a baseball stick? Why, when my daughter fell down, why did he hit her? For what? We don’t know this guy. He doesn’t know us. We don’t hate anybody because of religion or color. I teach my kids to love everybody.”

Prominent Muslim activist Rabia Chaudry agreed with Hassanen’s father.

“Road rage. Indeed,” Chaudry tweeted Monday. “If you think for a minute that her appearance had nothing to do with this crime, you’re lying to yourself.”

"Email a copy of Leading French Intellectual Michel Onfray Joins Demands to Recognize Murder of Sarah Halimi as Antisemitic Hate Crime to a friend

One of France’s most prominent public intellectuals has denounced the April 4 murder of Sarah Halimi – an orthodox Jewish pensioner who lived in the Paris suburb of Belleville – as an antisemitic crime, calling on the French authorities to recognize that fact by prosecuting the murderer accordingly.

Michel Onfray, a philosopher, told French newspaper Le Point that he rejected the account of Halimi’s murder depicting it as “not an antisemitic crime, not a crime committed by a Muslim fundamentalist.”

Onfray is one of fifteen leading intellectuals who signed a petition demanding that Halimi’s murder be investigated as an antisemitic crime. The petitioners – who also included the Jewish philosopher Alain Finkielkraut and the feminist theorist Elisabeth Badinter – pointed out that the murder took place at the height of France’s presidential campaign. They argued that the reluctance of the authorities to classify it as a hate crime committed by a Muslim was based on fear that doing so would boost the electoral fortunes of Marine Le Pen, the candidate of the far right National Front.

Halimi – a 66 year-old former kindergarten teacher and widow who lived alone – was murdered in the early hours of April 4 by Kada Traore, a 27-year-old immigrant from Mali. After breaking into Halimi’s apartment, Traore attacked Halimi and beat her ferociously. Her screams alerted neighbors who called the police; on arrival, they heard Traore yelling “Allahu Akhbar!” and “Shaitan!” (Arabic for ‘Satan’). Concerned that a terrorist attack was taking place, they called for anti-terror units to be deployed. But by the time these officers arrived at the scene, Halimi had been thrown by Traore from the window of her third-floor apartment to the ground below.

In the weeks that followed the murder, police enquiries focused on Traore’s mental health rather than his Islamist views, and the possibility remains that he will be deemed mentally unfit to stand trial. Interest in the case on the part of the French media has increased since Le Pen’s defeat by centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron in the May 7 election.

Onfray protested the combination of general silence about the case with the denial of its antisemitic motivation by asking, “How can we kill this poor woman twice?”

“Whenever there is an escalation in terror, there is an escalation in the denial of terror,” Onfray commented.

Traditionally associated with the French left, Onfray’s philosophical work is strongly influenced by anarchism and “hedonism” – which he defined in an interview as “identifying the highest good with your own pleasure and that of others.” An outspoken atheist, among Onfray’s prolific output is the 2007 “Atheist Manifesto: The Case Against Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.”

An uncompromising opponent of theocratic societies, Onfray courted controversy in a 2007 interview, when he said, “I do indeed think a civilization is more worthwhile where little girls are not genitally mutilated, rather than one where their wholeness is destroyed.”",1

"Washington, March 5, 2017: A Sikh man was injured when a masked gunman opened fire at him in front of his house in Washington after telling him “Go back to your own country.”

The victim, who was hit in the arm, survived the Friday night attack, the third shooting of an Indian national in the last 10 days in the US.

The attacks have claimed two lives and shocked the nation.

NewsGram brings to you current foreign news from all over the world.

The 39-year-old Sikh, who has not been identified by name, was working on his car in front of his house in Kent city of Washington state when the gunman described as white, who had his face partially covered, opened fire at him, police said.

“We’re early on in our investigation,” the Seattle Times quoted Kent Police chief Ken Thomas as saying on Saturday morning. “We are treating this as a very serious incident.”

According to KING5 TV, the incident was being investigated as a possible hate crime and police had reached out to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for help.

In the recent spate of attacks, Harnish Patel of Lancaster in South Carolina, was killed on Thursday, and Srinivas Kuchibhotla was murdered on February 22 in Olathe, Kansas.

Another Indian, Alok Madasani, who was injured in the Olathe attack, survived.

Satwinder Kaur, a candidate for Kent City Council, said on Facebook that the latest victim “wishes to remain anonymous at this time. So as a community we should respect that”. She said Kent Mayor Suzette Cooke has reached out to him.

“This incident is such a big deal because hate crimes to this extent do not happen in our community,” Kaur said.

Sikh community leader Jasmit Singh told the Times that the 39-year-old was released from the hospital.

“He is just very shaken up, both him and his family,” Singh said. “We’re all kind of at a loss in terms of what’s going on right now. This is just bringing it home. The climate of hate that has been created doesn’t distinguish between anyone.”

Check out NewsGram for latest international news updates.

According to Singh, Sikh men in area around Seattle have experienced “a kind of prejudice, a kind of xenophobia that is nothing that we’ve seen in the recent past”.

Before the Kent attack, the Sikh Coalition had released an advisory asking the community members to report instances of people “saying hateful things about your Sikh identity”.

In the aftermath of the Kansas attack, the coalition said: “We should not wait until someone gets hurt or killed to report hate incidents.”

Kent is about 30 kms from Seattle and is near the Congressional constituency of Pramila Jayapal, the Indian-origin member of the House of Representatives.

Jayapal tweeted: “Thoughts and prayers to family and entire Sikh community in the wake of horrific shooting. This must be investigated as #HateCrime.”

On Thursday night, Patel was shot outside his house in Lancaster.

Officials do not believe it was a hate crime. “I don’t have any reason to believe that this was racially motivated,” county Sheriff Barry Faile said on Friday.

In the February 22 Kansas incident, an American, Ian Grillot, who tried to stop the shooting, was also shot and injured.

A white Navy veteran Adam Purinton, 51, was arrested and charged with murder in the killing of Kuchibhotla. Purinton reportedly said that he had shot two Iranians.

The hate crime has been condemned by leaders in both the US and India.

In his address to the joint session of the Congress, Trump last Tuesday said: “Last week’s shooting in Kansas city reminds us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms.”

At a news conference in Washington on Friday, Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar said he had discussed the Kent incident with administration and Congressional leaders during his visit.

Jaishankar earlier met Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and House Speaker Paul Ryan.

“What we heard from very high-level, cabinet level that we should regard this as an act of an individual,” he said.

“The American justice system was at work, it could bring the perpetrators of this act to justice. It is being prosecuted as a hate crime.”

Hate crimes have been a part of the American fabric, including in the liberal state of Washington.

In Auburn in 2012, a Sikh taxi driver was attacked by a man who thought he was Muslim. The attacker was sentenced to three years in prison for the crime.

In 2015, Hindu place of worship in Kent, the Sanatan Dharma Temple, was attacked and had its windows smashed and the word “Fear,” painted on it.

Another Hindu temple in nearby Bothell was also attacked.

Neither of these hate crimes were condemned by former President Barack Obama or the media. (IANS)

"In the name of God, the Most Compassionate the Merciful. All praise and thanks belong to God, the Lord of the Worlds. May peace and prayers be upon Prophet Muhammad.

By now, you must have heard about what happened over the weekend.

In Virginia, a man carrying a bat attacked a group of American Muslim teenagers after taraweh prayers, kidnapped one of them, and beat her to death. Later that day, an anti-Muslim bigot in London crashed a van into a crowd of British Muslims outside a mosque just after taraweh prayers.

May Allah SWT (God, Glorified and Exalted) grant instant Paradise to those who were killed, swiftly heal those who were injured, and deliver justice to those responsible for the violence.

If such hate crimes make you sad, angry, or afraid, youre not alone. But American Muslims must not allow sorrow, anger or fear to paralyze us. Nor should we allow hate crimes to scare us out of being proudly and public Muslim.

Indeed, if you visit your local masjid for prayer, do so as often as you want. If you want to grow a beard or wear a thobe, go for it. If you sport a hijab or a flowing abaya, more power to you.

We have every right to be proudly and publicly Muslim anywhere and everywhere, especially our own country. But we must also be safely Muslim. To that end, every Georgia masjid, every Georgia Muslim family, and every Georgia Muslim community should take basic to improve safety and security.

Here are some steps we should take:

1. Masjid Security

Form a safety and security committee to oversee the protection of the masjid.

Use very noticeable high-definition outdoor and indoor security cameras to deter attackers and assist in the investigation of any incident.

Limits entry access to the masjid to TWO doors, but make many exit doors available.

If possible, keep the entry doors to the masjid locked, and require community members to type an electronic passcode to enter the building. This is meant to ensure that an attacker cannot enter the building and assault you from behind while you pray.

Per the advice of law enforcement, appoint at least one or two trusted and licensed community members to carry a concealed firearm inside the mosque so that these guardians can immediately respond to an active shooter.

Develop and practice an emergency evacuation plan.

Hire a police officer to visibly stand guard during Eid and Jumah.

Host an an active shooter response traning for the masjid.

Invite local politicians, law enforcement, churchgoers and others to the masjid for interfaith dinners.

2. Personal Security

Take multiple personal self-defense courses with your family.

Maintain situational awareness. In other words, be vigiant. Watch your back. Look around. This is especially important when entering or exiting a masjid or if youre visibly Muslim (hijab, abaya, thobe, beard, etc). Dont walk around with your eyes glued to your smartphone.

Walk in pairs or groups, especially at night. Better yet, dont go wandering around at night.

Carry personal self-defense items, including pepper spray, a contact taser or even an ink pen. Hold the item in your hand whenever youre walking to and from your car, especially if by yourself, or if in a strange location, or if visibly Muslim.

If verbally harassed in public, do NOT engage with the perpetrator. Get to a public place, or stay in a public place, and call 911 if you feel threatened.

Use personal self-defense items as a deterrent if someone approaches you in a threatening manner. Hold up pepper spray or a taser and warn the person threatening you to stay back. Activate the contact taser, which makes an incredibly loud and disturbing noise, as a warning.

Wear your hijab without pins. That is, wear your hijab in such a way that it will easily come off if someone grabs it. Why? If the hijab is tightly pinned around your head, and an attacker grabs it, the attacker can easily yank you to the ground or otherwise control your movements. But if the hijab is loose, the scarf will slip easily off your head, allowing you to flee.

If you are attacked and if you are unable to escape or use a personal security item, get very loud and fight back without hesitation. Target your attackers eyes, throat and/or kneecaps. You can also go for the groin, but many attackers might expect that.

Bottom line: we can, God willing, do much more to protect ourselves, our families, our houses of worship, and our communities. For more information, watch this video footage of CAIR Georgias 2016 self-defense seminar (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbr0qAqPegY&feature=share). It covers self-defense tips for women, active shooter response scenarios, and home security, among other topics.

Finally, contact CAIR Georgia if you would like to arrange for a self-defense seminar at your masjid or Islamic private school. In the meantime, please continue to be proudly, publicly, and safely Muslim.

May God protect people of good faith, of all faiths, from the threat of violence.

"Newsrooms across the U.S. are collaborating to tell stories and collect data related to hate and bias

Reliable data on hate crimes and bias incidents is scarce. But, what little data is available tells a sobering story: That incidents of hate-based crime are increasing in frequency across the United States.

In Colorado, reporting differs by region on the trends seen in hate crimes and bias incidents — some say incidents are increasing, while others say they are becoming less frequent. But, regardless of where you are, one narrative repeatedly appears: that very few hate-motivated incidents are reported.

In an effort to make incident reporting easier and to tell the stories of those who have experienced hate, bias or discrimination in any form, The Loveland Reporter-Herald has joined a coalition of newsrooms participating in ProPublicas Documenting Hate project.

Documenting Hate is a nationwide effort to collect reliable data on hate crimes and bias incidents. Project participants solicit and verify incident reports to contribute to a national database for use by journalists, researchers and civil rights organizations as they report on the nature and prevalence of hate incidents. Participants also report on incidents and data trends originating from their own communities that they cover.

ProPublica is an independent, nonprofit newsroom based in New York. Other project partners include The Google News Lab, PBS Newshour and The Denver Post, as well as about 70 other U.S. newsrooms, civil rights groups and universities.

A crucial element of this effort is an incident reporting form designed by ProPublica that is now hosted on The Reporter-Heralds website. If you have experienced an act of hate or bias, report your experience using the form embedded below.

The information will be shared with partners in the Documenting Hate project, but no one else will see the information you share without your permission. Law enforcement agencies are not included among the project partners and filling out the form does not mean a report to law enforcement will be made on your behalf.

"WASHINGTON, July 17, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nations largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, today released an update on anti-Muslim incidents in the second quarter (April-June) of 2017.

CAIRs quarterly report indicates that the number of hate crimes in the first half of 2017 spiked 91 percent compared to the same period in 2016, which was the worst year for such anti-Muslim incidents since the civil rights organization began its current documenting system in 2013.

The number of bias incidents in 2017 also increased by 24 percent compared to the first half of 2016.

[NOTE: Bias incidents are defined as cases in which there was an identifiable element of religious discrimination. Hate crimes are criminal offenses against persons or property, or incidents that can be charged as such under relevant state or federal statute.]

http://www.cair.com/images/pdf/Civil-Rights-Data-Quarter-Two-Update-Anti-Muslim-Bias-Incidents-April--June-2017.pdf

The presidential election campaign and the Trump administration have tapped into a seam of bigotry and hate that has resulted in the targeting of American Muslims and other minority groups, said Zainab Arain, coordinator in CAIRs Department to Monitor and Combat Islamophobia. If acts of bias impacting the American Muslim community continue as they have been, 2017 could be one of the worst years ever for such incidents.

The most frequent type of incidents documented by CAIR in the second quarter of 2017 were harassment, defined as a non-violent or non-threatening incident. The second most common type of bias incidents were hate crimes, and have involved physical violence or property damage.

Episodes in which the complainant was questioned by the FBI or otherwise appears to have inappropriately targeted by the agency are the third most common.

The most prevalent trigger of anti-Muslim bias incidents in 2017 remains the victims ethnicity or national origin, accounting for 32 percent of the total. Twenty percent of incidents occurred because of an individual being perceived as Muslim. A Muslim womans headscarf was a trigger in 15 percent of incidents.

The report dataset is drawn primarily from the intakes CAIR conducts each year. With each case, civil rights and legal staff seek to ensure the highest possible level of accuracy.

CAIR recently launched an app to share critical know your rights information and simplify the process to report hate crimes and bias incidents and is urging Muslims to download the app and utilize this resource to stay informed and empowered.

For a quick download of CAIRs civil rights app, click here: http://www.cair.com/app

Community members may also report any bias incidents to CAIRs Civil Rights Department at 202-742-6420, or by filing a report at: http://www.cair.com/report

CAIR is Americas largest Muslim civil liberties and advocacy organization. Its mission is to enhance the understanding of Islam, encourage dialogue, protect civil liberties, empower American Muslims, and build coalitions that promote justice and mutual understanding.

La misión de CAIR es mejorar la comprensión del Islam, fomentar el diálogo, proteger las libertades civiles, capacitar a los musulmanes estadounidenses, y construir coaliciones que promuevan la justicia y la comprensión mutua.

"A salesman who was the principle of a South Jersey company has been sentenced to three years in prison for fraudulently stealing $100,000 from one of his clients and using for his own benefit, U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito announced. Patrick McCullagh, 70, of Georgetown, Kentucky, was previously convicted of wire fraud following an eight-day trial before U.S. District Judge Mary L. Cooper. Cooper imposed the sentence on Wednesday. McCullagh was also sentenced to one year of supervised release and must pay $98,067.82 in restitution. McCullagh was the principle of MidAtlantic Regional Services Inc., a purported insurance company located in Bordentown, according to documents filed in this case and evidence presented at the trial. In 2001, McCullagh was entrusted with money that was entrusted to a client when the clients mother died, authorities said. McCullagh told the client he would invest that money in a way that would preserve the principle while paying the client back in interest. However, McCullagh instead kept the money and used it to forge withdrawal requests so he could steal money from that clients investment accounts, authorities said. He also had his clients account statements diverted from his address. McCullagh also used money from those investment accounts to pay the client the interest he promised, according to authorities. He even told his client that some of the investments were tied-up in legal disputes surrounding a Kentucky property and that he needed money for legal fees, which the victim later provided.

"KANSAS CITY, Mo. – A man allegedly verbally and physically assaulted a Muslim student at Metropolitan Community College – Penn Valley campus in an incident the FBI is describing as a potential hate crime.

The student said she was walking down the stairway when an unknown male voice uttered a derogatory statement toward the woman.

When the woman turned around, she said the suspect struck her in the face, causing her to fall down the stairs.

The woman reported the incident to campus police, who notified the FBI.

In a statement, a Metropolitan Community College spokeswoman says the incident happened on a day that was part of an international campaign to scare and encourage violence against Muslims.

The FBI said Wednesday it’s offering a reward of up to $10,000 leading to the arrest of the suspect in the attack.

"WASHINGTON (TIP): A US Navy veteran, on March 7, pleaded guilty to the murder of Indian engineer Srinivas Kuchibhotla in a racially motivated hate crime at a bar in Kansas City last year that raised fears of growing intolerance in America following President Donald Trump’s tough rhetoric on immigration.

Adam Purinton, 52, pleaded guilty before a Kansas court. He was charged with first-degree murder of Kuchibhotla, 32, and two counts of attempted first-degree murder in the shootings of his friend, Alok Madasani, and a bystander, who chased Purinton after he fled the Austin’s Bar and Grill in Olathe city on February 22 last year.

Purinton, yelled, “Get out of my country”, before shooting Kuchibhotla, who later died from injuries sustained in the attack. Kuchibhotla and Madasani worked as engineers at Garmin, a tech company that makes GPS devices.

Kuchibhotla’s widow Sunayana Dumala welcomed the guilty plea. “Today’s guilty verdict will not bring back my Srinu, but it will send a strong message that hate is never acceptable,” she said.

Purinton sentencing is scheduled for May 4.

Prosecutors alleged Purinton committed offences after substantial planning and premeditation, attempted to kill more than one person in a single criminal episode.

The tragic death of Kedarie Johnson, a well-liked high school junior from Burlington, reinforces the importance of adding transgender protections under Iowa’s Hate Crimes statute. I believe that it is appropriate for the federal authorities to investigate this death as a hate crime and I’m hopeful that all those involved will be punished to the fullest extent of the law.



Growing up LGBTQ in Iowa is tough. As legislators, we must do all we can to support safe schools, safe communities, and offer full protection to LGBTQ students and Iowans who are often marginalized and victimized at increasingly disproportionate levels. Many crimes against LGBTQ Iowans go unreported in our state, because of failures by county attorneys and local police. I call upon the Iowa Legislature to act swiftly and add transgender protections to Iowa’s Hate Crimes statute.

"The FBI, in a report released Monday, said law enforcement agencies nationally reported a five-year high in hate crimes, with 6,121 in 2016. That’s up over 2015, which saw 5,818 such crimes reported, a near 5% increase.

However, 88% of participating law enforcement agencies reported no hate crimes in their jurisdictions, an ongoing challenge for data collection efforts. In comparison, the Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates that an annual average of 250,000 incidents of hate crime victimizations, about 40 times the number reported by the FBI.



The dots on this map represent the agencies that reported no hate crimes in their jurisdictions in 2016. Data from the FBI Hate Crime Statistics, 2016.

The most recent statistics show that 1,747 hate crimes were reported in the last quarter of the year — October through December. That figure is a 25.9% increase over the same period in 2015, when 1,388 hate crimes were reported.



Bias incidents based on religion from 2014-2016. Data from the FBI Hate Crime Statistics, 2016.

The increase further confirms the explosion of bias incidents the Southern Poverty Law Center and other civil rights organizations and journalists reported in the wake of the election.

Also of note was the steady increase in hate crimes over the year that were also likely related to the campaign. Trump campaign rallies were regularly marked by violence and reports of an increase in bias incidents at K-12 schools started during the primaries.

In fact, Trump is facing several lawsuits over his rhetoric at campaign rallies, including one in federal court in Louisville, Kentucky, which alleges that Trump encouraged supporters to remove a diverse group of protestors by yelling “get’em out of here.”

The FBI said 58.9% of victims were targeted because of their ethnicity, race or ancestry bias. Another 21.1% were picked out because of their religious affiliation and 16.7% were attacked because of the offenders’ sexual-orientation bias.

The FBI reported 381 anti-Muslim crimes, up more than 20% from the 301 reported in 2015. Anti-Jewish crimes skyrocketed to 834 reported incidents in 2016, up 16% from the 695 reported incidents the previous year.



Bias incidents by category in 2016. Data from the FBI Hate Crimes Statistics, 2016.

The bulk of reported offenders, 46.3% were white, while 26.1% were black. Nearly all offenders, 83.8% were over 18-years-old.

Most of the hate crimes were crimes against people, which accounted for 4,720 incidents. Crimes against property accounted for 2,519 incidents in 2016.

Alabama reported 12 hate crimes in 2016, with seven coming in Birmingham, three in Hoover and one each in Florence and Foley.

A parks officer has resigned after being criticized for not intervening during last months 14 incident. which was caught on video at a northwestern Chicago park.

In the video, Irizarry pleads for help as a man harasses her and says her shirt is un-American. The officer initially appears to ignore the pleas.

Irizarry said she was celebrating her 24th birthday at Caldwell Woods park when the man approached her and asked her why she was wearing the sleeveless Puerto Rico flag shirt. It also had Puerto Rico written below the neckline.

Irizarry recorded the encounter on her phone, saying she felt threatened, and posted the video to Facebook.

On Monday, Forest Preserves of Cook County, which administers the park, tweeted it was aware of the incident and video, and had launched an investigation.

The Cook County Forest Preserve District police officer, Patrick Connor, resigned Wednesday, and an investigation continues, the agency said.

An attorney for the Illinois Fraternal Order of Police Labor Council, which is representing Connor, said that the video does not look good but cautioned that it may not tell the whole story.

We dont know what was happening outside the video; we dont know what was going on inside his (Connors) head at the time, the attorney, Tamara Cummings, said Thursday. He was looking forward to an opportunity to explain what was happening. However, given the media attention and pressure, he decided to resign.

Given his decision to resign, he wont be offering any additional comment on what might have happened during this situation, she said. Hes very distraught and not happy about having to leave employment much sooner than he intended, but because of the strong reaction from the public and political figures, he thought it would be unrealistic to stay as an officer.

The preserve district police chief, Kelvin Pope, said he didnt know why Connor apparently didnt step in initially.

Pope said that Connor feels he wasnt given a fair shake and that he was very remorseful. But the officer resigned before investigators could ask him what happened during a disciplinary hearing, Pope said at a news conference Thursday.

(Connors) personnel file will reflect that this officer did not resign in good standing, with a note indicating that he left the district with discipline pending, said Arnold Randall, the park agencys general superintendent.

Call for hate crime charges

Cook County Commissioner Jesús Chuy García had called for hate crimes charges against Trybus.

A charge for simple assault or disorderly conduct is not sufficient, García said. We cannot allow that ugly rhetoric to be the norm in Cook County.

Randall, the forest preserves superintendent, said his agency has apologized to Irizarry and refunded the money she had paid for a permit to gather at a picnic table area on the day of the incident.

He said his agency would re-examine diversity training for its officers and other employees.

Its up to each and every one of us to present a better model to demonstrate with our own actions how to treat each other with more respect, he told reporters Thursday. We might start with the fine example presented by Mia Irizarry and her family, who handled this ugly incident with great composure, never stooping to the level of the man who attacked her.

The incident

In the footage, a man can be seen approaching Irizarry saying: You should not be wearing that in the United States of America. He gets closer to her and asks Are you a citizen? Are you a United States citizen?

Irizarry says Puerto Rico is part of the United States and the man approaches her multiple times. She asks a park police officer to help, saying, I am renting this area and hes harassing me about the shirt that Im wearing.

Later she says: Officer, I feel entirely uncomfortable, can you remove ... please officer as the officer is seen walking away from her.

Then she says: Officer, Im renting, I paid for a permit for this area. I do not feel comfortable with him here, is there anything you can do?

The officer can then be seen talking to the man who gesticulates back and tells him to shut the f*** up.

More police arrive and Irizarry says she still doesnt feel safe. The man resumes his abuse, saying: Youre not American, if you were American you wouldnt wear that. You know that right?

A female officer asks to see his ID and can be heard telling him that hes intoxicated, to which he replies, Well thats your judgment. She explains that Irizarry has a permit and she warns him he could be arrested for not being compliant.

You dont come here harassing people, the officer continues. People have just as much right to be here as you and when youre drunk, you dont belong here.

The female officer then speaks with Irizarry, who gives her version of the incident, and the officer explains that they were called to the area after a report a man was choking a woman.

Eventually the first officer on the scene takes notes of Irizarrys account and says he was at the scene due to the separate incident, noting that she was not being attacked though acknowledging she felt threatened.

Irizarry can be heard explaining to the officer that the incident began when she and others had asked the group the man was in if they could move as they had a permit for the area. She said the group politely complied but her Puerto Rico shirt appeared to act as a trigger to the man.

Puerto Rico is a US commonwealth with its own constitution. Puerto Ricans have been American citizens since 1917 and have the right to vote in US presidential primaries but not in presidential elections.

Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly spelled the surname of the police officer who resigned. His name is Patrick Connor.

"MAYFIELD HEIGHTS, OH — A Hawken School teachers husband was held hostage on Monday. The supposed captors wanted a payment to release the man. At least, thats what a scam artist told her over the phone. The teachers husband was fine. She was just the latest target of a scam that claims a persons loved one is being held hostage. The callers say theyve got one of your loved ones and will hold them captive until a ransom is paid. The hope is that victims will be so overwhelmed with panic theyll immediately wire the cash. Sheryl Harris, the director of the Cuyahoga County Department of Consumer Affairs, said the hostage scam was being used on the West Coast a few years ago. It appears the scam has worked its way to Northeast Ohio. We understand people will be scared and concerned for family members, we just want them to start texting family to figure out where the [supposedly affected] person is, she told Patch. They will find out that person is safe and sound. These scammers just want people to be in a panic so they dont think straight. The teacher at Hawken wasnt the only person targeted by one of these scams recently. A Mayfield Heights woman was told her husband had been in a car accident and was refusing to pay for the damages. In response, the womans husband was being held hostage until money was received for the vehicle. If someone is telling you that theres some danger to you or a loved one and a payment will make it OK, that should be a red flag, Harris said. Scammers want to panic you and then give you an immediate solution that will make that problem go away. If folks can remember thats a red flag, we encourage them to text other family members and tell them whats going on. Luckily, the womans husband emailed her while the call was happening. She knew then it was a scam and contacted the police. A 21-year-old Solon man wasnt so lucky. He was traveling out-of-state on April 18 when he got a call from an unknown number. The caller told the man they had his father in captivity and would kill him if they didnt get $900 wired to them. The 21-year-old panicked, went to the nearest Walmart and sent the money. Only after he had sent the money did he reach out to his father and discover he was actually fine, he had never been kidnapped or held hostage. Dont make a payment until you can ascertain the family members whereabouts, Harris said. Do whatever you have to do to get [the scam artist] off the phone and reach out to other people. You can also call the police if you think theres a real threat to your family. Ultimately, the so-called hostage scam is a variation of the grandparent or IRS scams. In all instances, callers are trying to induce panic in their victims. Once the adrenaline is pumping, thinking clearly and cogently becomes more arduous. Thats when mistakes get made. Invariably victims tell us that after they made the payment, they noticed things were amiss. But when youre in a panic you dont see things straight, Harris confirmed. The key to avoid being victimized is to remain calm and to reach out, as soon as possible, to a loved one. Do not make a payment to one of these callers until you have spoken to your loved one.

"WILLIMANTIC, CT — Two eastern Connecticut murder suspects have been brought to the state from Arizona and were to appear before a judge on Wednesday with $1 million bonds on their heads, state police said. Gov. Dannel P. Malloy himself issued the extradition warrant to bring them back to the Nutmeg State. One suspect is Juan Chach, 24, of 136 Pleasant St., Willimantic, who goes by the street name of El Cholo and is also known as Juan Chach-Cahuec, state police said.

The murder took place in Willimantic on Nov. 13 and the two managed to slip away to Arizona despite an intensive manhunt, state police said. Chach has been charged with murder and evidence tampering, state police said. Aperez has been charged with being an accessory to the murder as well as evidence tampering, state police said. State police had identified the victim as Francisco Delacruz-Coj, 32,of 38 Pulaski Court, Willimantic.

"LONG BEACH, CA – A 77-year-old man accused of murdering a Long Beach fire captain and wounding two others at a senior housing complex made his initial court appearance Monday in a wheelchair, but his arraignment was postponed. Thomas Man Kim, who was wearing a hospital gown, did not speak during the brief hearing. A judge agreed to postpone the arraignment until Aug. 15 at the request of Kims public defender, who said she had not been able to communicate with her client due to an apparent medical issue. People who know Kim told a CBS2/ KCAL9 reporter that he is suffering from cancer, has been undergoing chemotherapy and also has a kidney disorder, describing him as very frail. Kim is charged with capital murder and is also facing one count of attempted murder of a firefighter, two counts of attempted murder and one count each of arson of an inhabited structure and explosion with intent to murder in the June 25 killing of Capt. Dave Rosa, who was responding to a report of an explosion at the Covenant Manor senior living facility. Another firefighter, Ernesto Torres, and a civilian who lived in the building were wounded, but survived. Prosecutors will determine later whether to seek the death penalty for Kim, who they allege set off an explosive device in his apartment in an effort to kill a female neighbor who lived above him and with whom he had been feuding. Police said a note that was drafted by Kim led investigators to believe the blast was a murder/suicide attempt. Investigators believe the fire was set as a result of the dispute between Kim and his neighbor, not to draw first responders to the location to ambush them, according to a statement released by the Long Beach Police Department. A search warrant affidavit obtained by the Daily Breeze stated there was an explosion in his (Kims) room earlier and he admitted to officers he has a revolver, and he got scared and started shooting. Kim had burnt hair and clothing when police discovered him while responding to the 11-story complex in the 600 block of East Fourth Street, according to the affidavit. Thousands of mourners gathered at the Long Beach Convention Center last week at a memorial service for Rosa, a 17-year veteran of the Long Beach Fire Department and 45-year-old married father of two sons.Dozens of fire trucks lined the streets outside the Convention Center, and a throng of uniformed firefighters saluted as Rosas flag-draped coffin was slowly driven to the ceremony. The casket was then escorted by pallbearers into the building, led by a color guard carrying flags. Rosas oldest son, Alec, told the crowd gathered at the service that the news of his fathers killing had left him in shock. My dads a fireman. Firemen arent supposed to get shot, he said. The Long Beach Fire Department announced last week that a fund has been established for Rosas family. Information about the fund is available at www.friendsoflbfire.org/police-fire-memorial.

"“When I told my kid that I want to go back and check, they were a bit scared. I said, We cant leave the poor girl alone.’”

A Chinese Australian woman was attacked by a man in Burwood, in the suburbs of Melbourne, which has a large Chinese Australian population.

The Chinese woman, identified only as Lina, said she was waiting near a traffic light outside a shopping mall when a stranger came to her and yelled, “Get out of my country.”

She tried to avoid the Caucasian-looking man and walked away but the man punched her right in the face, which immediately started bleeding.

Chinese Australian punched in the face in racist attack on Sydney street https://t.co/zcgU0B5ksI Burwood plaza. Poor lady — Anna (@spannaforce) March 2, 2017

A witness of the attack, who remained anonymous, said she was driving past the road when she saw the incident. She tried to intervene by slowing down the car and honked to get attention from other drivers, but in return the attacker allegedly started shouting at her and hit her car windows.

“I was thinking that if someone would get out of their car to intervene, I may get out my car too,” she said.

The witness was driving with her children and there was a long line of cars behind her, which forced her to drive away. However, she managed to come back and check Lina, who at that point was bleeding excessively.

“When I told my kid that I want to go back and check, they were a bit scared. I said, We cant leave the poor girl alone,’” she said.

Lina believes the assault was “a severe racial attack.” The anonymous witness also backed Lina’s comments and said, “Even if it is not considered as a racial attack, I think we still need to be concerned. I hope my witness [evidence] can help the Police to fast track the case.”

According to a report, almost 40 percent of racial attacks in Australia occur in public places. A majority of people who witness these racial attacks choose to remain out of it and don’t help the victim.

Priscilla Bryceis, managing director of a nonprofit organization said, “They’re more likely to assist if someone else initiates a response. But also, people can also [sic] remain quiet if they don’t feel safe to speak up or step in, or if they feel unsure of what to do or say to help.”

"BRICK, NJ -- (Updated, 1:45 p.m.) Authorities are seeking the publics help and information in connection with the skull found Tuesday in the Lake Riviera section of Brick Township. Al Della Fave, spokesman for the Ocean County Prosecutors office, said the skull was discovered about 3 p.m. on Tuesday, confirming information that was given to the Brick Patch by a resident who lives in the part of Lake Riviera where the skull was found. Della Fave supplied photos of the skull. The skull was lying just off the road at the edge of a wooded area in the area of Arizona Drive and Old Toms River Road, according to a photo supplied by the resident. Old Toms River Road/Arizona Drive was closed Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday between Beaverson Boulevard and Emerald Drive while authorities searched the woods for anything related to the skull, Brick police said. An initial statement referred to it as a head, but was later clarified as a skull. For years, kids who lived in Lake Riviera rode bicycles in those wooded areas that border Old Toms River Road and behind homes that sit on Arizona Drive, cutting through those woods on their way to Lake Riviera Middle School, which is across Beaverson Boulevard. Old Toms River Road intersects with Beaverson Boulevard at the bend where Beaverson becomes Shorrock Street; once an almost 90-degree turn, the road was reconfigured and the angle widened and a traffic signal was installed at the Old Toms River Road-Beaverson intersection. As of this school year, however, students are no longer permitted to ride bicycles to the middle school because of the volume of traffic along Beaverson, which becomes Shorrock as it turns the corner right near where the search is being conducted. That increased traffic is due in part to the fact that Shorrock now connects directly to the Garden State Parkway at the western end of the road, where it crosses Route 70 by Home Depot. Another resident said there were rumors that a homeless man had been living in one of the wooded spots. Anyone with information regarding this investigation should call the Brick Township Police Department at 732-262-1143 or the Ocean County Prosecutors Office at 732-929-2027.

"LONG ISLAND CITY, QUEENS -- Cash, loaded guns, and a cherry red Lamborghini are just a few of the goodies police uncovered in a drug bust on four Queens traffickers linked to at least two overdose deaths, prosecutors said. They found the rest - including 22 pounds of narcotics - hours earlier inside the ringleaders Brooklyn drug palace prosecutors said. He and three others accused of supplying dealers with heroin, fentanyl and other drugs were arrested in the bust - the result of a yearlong investigation prompted by the two fatal overdoses. Dionne Slay Sharrow, 35, was arrested in his Long Island City luxury apartment after authorities identified him as the groups alleged ringleader, said Special Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget Brennan. Cops seized a loaded gun and nearly $600,000 from his high-rise on 51st Avenue, along with a Lamborghini parked in the buildings garage. Sharrow is accused of supplying heroin, fentanyl and cocaine to the other three suspects, who in turn allegedly sold the lethal drugs to dealers in Brooklyn and Queens, along with a few in Orange and Ulster counties, according to the charges. The escalating toll of overdose and addiction has become unbearable to all but the drug dealers and traffickers who peddle death in ten dollar bags, Brennan said. As the citys drug-related deaths continue to climb, prosecutors claim the rings drugs - namely heroin and fentanyl - were behind the September 2016 fatal overdose of a 22-year-old Brooklyn man and that of a 42-year-old Kew Gardens man in May 2017. Heroin, unfortunately, has made a deadly comeback in New York City and in the surrounding suburbs, said Queens District Attorney Richard Brown. We are witnessing heroin being mixed with the synthetic drug Fentanyl, which is up to 50 times more potent than heroin alone. Police on Tuesday night raided the drug palace Sharrow allegedly maintained in Bath Beach, Brooklyn, where they found 22 pounds of narcotics stashed in couches, an oven and other hiding spots throughout the apartment, according to the charges. They also recovered thousands of dollars in cash, several pounds of marijuana and supplies to distribute the drugs. Cops arrested Pablo Cito Vallecillo, 39, at the drug house after watching him carry a bag filled with cash into the apartment, prosecutors said. Two others - Antonio Lopez, 40, and Jason Keating, 41 - were arrested in their respective Queens homes. Cops recovered a shotgun, two loaded pistols and hundreds of heroin-filled glassine envelopes from Lopezs place in Howard Beach, according to the charges. Inside Keatings Jamaica residence, they seized thousands of dollars and several pounds of marijuana. The arrests of these defendants undoubtedly saved the lives of many New Yorkers, who might otherwise have overdosed, said NYPD Commissioner James ONeill. All four were arraigned in Manhattan Supreme Court Wednesday on charges including conspiracy and criminal sale of a controlled substance. Lead photo via Shutterstock.",0

"Two people, including a teenager, have been arrested and charged with the murder of a Roswell man who was selling his gaming console on Craigslist. Nathaniel Vivan, 20, and a 16-year-old girl are both in custody following the Friday, Sept. 12 shooting death of Daniel John Zeitz, 28, of Roswell, the Sandy Springs Police Department said in a press release. Zeitz was found dead by officers after they responded to a call around 9:30 p.m. in the 5300 block of Treelodge Parkway. The Roswell man was found lying on the ground in front of building 5306 with a gunshot wound to the side of his chest, police spokesperson Sgt. Ron Momon said. A short time later, Sandy Springs detectives learned that a man was being treated at Northside Hospital with a gunshot wound to the hand, Momon stated. Brookhaven Police detectives were at the hospital interviewing the injured man, who Momon said told them he was a victim of a crime in their jurisdiction. However, Momon noted the man later told authorities he was shot while he and his girlfriend were at the Legends of Dunwoody Apartments to rob a man of his PS4 video game system that was advertised on Craigslist. The female juvenile, who was at the hospital with Vivan, was taken into custody by Sandy Springs police detectives. Those detectives also found the .25 caliber pistol inside the suspects car, which was parked at the hospital. Detectives interviewed the man and teen, and learned they responded to a Craigslist ad for the console and met with Zeitz in the parking lot of 5306 Treelodge Parkway. Vivan, who was seating in the drivers seat of his car, struggled with Zeitz, [who was] standing outside the car, for the PS4, Momon stated. During the struggle, the juvenile fired one shot from the .25 caliber gun. The bullet passed through Vivans hand and struck Zeitz in the side. Detectives also learned that the teenagers child, about 16 months old, was also in the back seat of the suspects car during the robbery and shooting. The child was later turned over to the teens relatives. Both suspects remain behind bars pending their first court appearance. (Photo: Daniel John Zeitz of Roswell. Credit: Facebook)",0

"The man allegedly responsible for the death of an activist at a white supremacist rally in August is now facing federal hate crime charges.

James Alex Fields Jr., 21, was arrested last year after he drove his car into a crowd of counter-protestors at a “Unite the Right Rally” in Charlottesville, Virginia, striking and injuring several people and killing 32-year-old activist Heather Heyer.

Fields, an Ohio resident, was indicted on Wednesday in the Western District of Virginia on 30 counts: one count of a hate crime act resulting in the death of Heather Heyer, 28 counts of hate crime acts causing bodily injury and involving an attempt to kill, and one count of racially motivated violent interference with a federally protected activity, according to a press release from the Department of Justice.

Fields also faces first-degree murder charges in state court, The New York Times reports.

Last year’s “Unite the Right” rally protested the removal of a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee and drew hundreds of white supremacists and counter-protesters to Charlottesville’s Emancipation Park, The New York Times reports.

Fields, returning to his vehicle after an “unlawful assembly” was declared, “observed the crowd while idling” before he slowly reversed his vehicle, the indictment alleges. He then “rapidly accelerated, ran through a stop sign,” and “drove directly into the crowd, striking numerous individuals, killing Heather Heyer, and injuring many others.”

“Fields’s vehicle stopped only when it struck another vehicle near the intersection of Fourth and Water streets. He then rapidly reversed his vehicle and fled the scene,” the release continued.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions addressed the indictment in a statement included in the DOJ’s press release.

“At the Department of Justice, we remain resolute that hateful ideologies will not have the last word and that their adherents will not get away with violent crimes against those they target,” Sessions said.

“Last summer’s violence in Charlottesville cut short a promising young life and shocked the nation. Today’s indictment should send a clear message to every would-be criminal in America that we aggressively prosecute violent crimes of hate that threaten the core principles of our nation.”

LANSING -- The FBI is assisting Lansing police with their investigation of the July 5 assault of a Hispanic man.

The incident is being investigated as a hate crime, Lansing Police Chief Mike Yankowski said at a press conference Tuesday.

“We do not tolerate hate crimes here in the city of Lansing,” Yankowski said. “...We will utilize all available federal, state, county, local resources in our investigations.”

More than 50 people gathered at Lansing City Hall for the press conference Tuesday to discuss the assault. Among those gathered were elected state and local officials and representatives from more than a dozen community organizations.

Police have released few details on the incident, beyond saying they were called to the intersection of Denver Avenue and Cedar Street about 11:40 p.m. July 5 for reports of an assault. They located a 47-year-old Hispanic man.

Yankowski said the mans statement and police officers’ investigation of the scene led them to begin a hate crime investigation. Police have previously said they found a note or sign with the victim referencing the victim’s ethnic origin.

Yankowski said he could not provide further details because the investigation is ongoing.

Police released a composite sketch of one of two suspects in the assault. Further information on the second suspect was not immediately available.

Yankowski said anyone who may have been in the area between 11:30 p.m. and midnight and observed anything that may aid the investigation should call Lansing Police Detective Quincy Scroggins at 483-6848 or Crime Stoppers at 483-7867.

Mayor Virg Bernero said Lansing is “for all intents and purposes a sanctuary city” that celebrates diversity.

“We do not condone nor do we accept a single act of hatred against any individual in our city,” Bernero said at the press conference Tuesday.

Elva Reyes, a member of Action of Greater Lansing and Latino Leaders for the Enhancement of Advocacy and Development, said community members need to work together to maintain Lansing’s reputation as a welcoming city.

“A human being was violated in a manner that we have not seen before,” Reyes said. “If we don’t say something now, when will we?

Emily Dievendorf, a member of the Lansing Association for Human Rights, said community groups are working on a “rapid response” protocol to address potential hate crimes.

“We need to come together as a community before, during and after,” Dievendorf said.

Yankowski said Lansing police have investigated two to five potential hate crimes in 2017, but did not have statistics for 2016 readily available.

The Lansing Police Department reported nine hate or bias crimes to Michigan State Police in 2015, according to a report from Michigan Incident Crime Reporting.

The cases involved alleged incidents that were “anti-homosexual,” “anti-Catholic,” “anti-multi-races,” “anti-American Indian/Alaskan Native,” and “anti-white,” according to the report.

"HOUSTON, TX — A man who broke into a womans apartment and terrorized her three children is in the Harris County Jail. The incident happened at about 12:30 a.m., in the 2200 block of Marnel Road. Police said the three children, who were home alone, heard someone banging on the door. When no one answered, police said the man broke out a window and went inside the apartment. (For more news like this, find your local Patch here. If you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app; download the free Patch Android app here.) The children escaped through a window in one of the bedrooms and called 911. After a two-hour stand-off with SWAT officers went into the apartment, and found that the man had locked himself in the bathroom. The man refused to come out so SWAT officers went in, and found the man naked and still refusing to surrender. The man was tased and taken into custody. Investigators later learned that the man had been stalking the women. Police said the man will be charged with burglary and could face more charges of attempted sexual assault.

"Corey Yunke has been on the job as Rosevilles crime analyst for less than two months. But already he has one simple idea for cutting down on the citys vice—report the small things.Before I went into crime prevention, I wouldnt necessarily report the little stuff—like somebody snooping around—because I thought that an officer would roll their eyes, Yunke said.But today, Yunke said he believes that citizens reporting suspicious activity is essential to impeding crime. (He comes to Roseville from Grand Rapids, Michigan, where he worked as a crime prevention organizer.)Yunke points to a recent incident where a Roseville resident reported of person perched on the shoulders of his friend looking into a window. The tip led to a narcotics bust and an investigation into a possible attempted burglary.Yunke said that many crimes in Roseville are crimes of opportunity and that hes seen an uptick in theft from autos.Large parking lots at parks and businesses such as L.A. Fitness are targets for thieves, Yunke said.You leave all your stuff—you leave your wallet, your laptop, your purse—and the people know its there, he said. It doesnt take much—it takes literally five seconds—to break the window, reach in, scoop, grab, and leave, he said.Yunke said he intends to continue working with Rosevilles Neighborhood Watch program, in which more than 100 block captains keep an eye on their communities, to help combat these types of crime.Its tough for the Roseville police to be everywhere all the time so we encourage the block captains to be our eyes and ears, Yunke said.",0
"The Reno GBTQA Community Center (OUR Center) was the site of a vandal who smashed a window and door causing an estimated $7,500 to $10,000 worth of damage.

Panic in the community was quickly thwarted after it was reported the assailant(s) had actually shot into the building, but the quick thinking of many community members including Paco Lachoy of The Reno Gay Page took to social media to correct the reports.

Board President Jeromy Manke said in a presser that he was somewhat in shock, adding, “Witnesses in the building said a man in what appeared to be a ski mask approached the building and yelled ‘Get Down’ and then hurled rocks at the windows sending glass everywhere.”

According to Menke, the incident happened early Tuesday evening on January 2, at about 7 pm while people were still inside.

Reno Police Department spokesman Tim Broadway reports that four rocks were found, three taken in as evidence.

“Right now, we are investigating the incident as a destruction of property,” Broadway said. “We are in the early stages of the investigation. But the search is on for the person(s) responsible.”

Investigators are asking adjacent businesses for any CCTV footage that may help in the arrest of the vandal(s). At this time, it cannot be determined if the crime was fueled by hate because the sexual orientation of the perpetrator(s) is unknown.

People who were inside the building at the time of the incident fell to the floor and took cover wherever they could before calling police. There were no injuries reported according to The Reno Gay Page.

“We will be open as usual,” Manke said. “This won’t deter our mission to serve, to build, to strengthen the community.”

A Facebook video assessment was taken by Northern Nevada Pride Marketing Director YeVonne Allen of the damage, it is quickly going viral, garnering 20k views and 500 shares in hopes someone will come forward with a lead in the case.

Allen dictates her concern that even in her small community this type of incident can still happen, she says in the video, “…it sort of goes to show then even in what we think is progressive Reno, that we are getting so much better, so excepting, that there are people with so much hate in their hearts out there.”

The community is in shock and saddened that this could happen in what is supposed to be free of danger, “We wanted OUR Center to be a safe place,” said Manke.

Insurance may replace some of the broken items, but OUR Center relies heavily on community donations and they are asking for the communitys help to replace the windows.

"Here’s some depressing news. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) is reporting that in 2016 the number of hate groups active in the U.S. increased for the second year in a row.

According to the group’s annual report ”The Year in Hate and Extremism,” there were a total of 917 hate groups operating in the U.S. in 2016, an increase from 892 in 2015 and 784 in 2014.

The number of anti-Muslim groups grew the most, from 34 in 2015 to 101 in 2016.

A hate group is defined by Wikipedia as “an organized group or movement that advocates and practices hatred, hostility, or violence towards members of a race, ethnicity, nation, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation or any other designated sector of society.”

But it’s not just hate groups. At the same time, the F.B.I reported a 67 percent increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes in 2015, the most recent year for which the agency has statistics. In that year, 257 anti-Muslim episodes were reported to the police. That’s the highest number since 2001, when the 9/11 terrorist attacks led to more than 480 hate crimes.

Jumping forward to 2017, the SPLC learned of 867 bias incidents in the first 10 days after Trump’s election, including more than 300 targeting immigrants or Muslims.

“The Trump Phenomenon Has Really Unleashed Right-Wing Hate“

Donald Trump’s references to Mexicans as “rapists” and “drug dealers,” along with his 2015 proposal to bar Muslims from entering the U.S. are clearly responsible for stirring up anger and hatred in his followers. But that was just the beginning of his work to normalize these feelings.

Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the SPLC, said Mr. Trump’s election had been “absolutely electrifying to the radical right.” He added, “The Trump phenomenon has really unleashed right-wing hate in this country in a way that is difficult to remember.”

Interestingly, the number of organized anti-government groups, like armed militias and the KKK, fell by almost 40 percent last year, from 998 in 2015 to to 623 in 2016. Researchers with SPLC attribute that decline to the mainstreaming presence of conspiracy theories about Islam and immigrants that began on the political fringe.

Trump‘s False Claims

Trump has used his bully pulpit to stoke fear with a whole lot of lies. Here’s a list of some of his inflammatory comments that aren’t backed up by facts.

“If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians,” Trump declared.

Not so, says Renad Mansour, a fellow at London’s Chatham House, an independent policy institute. According to Mansour, the number of Christian refugees accepted in the US was already “disproportionate” and available statistics contradict Trump’s claim.

“The Christians have been persecuted, yes, and they were forced to flee Isis territory,” he told The Independent. “But for example the Yazidis weren’t even given the option to flee – the women were taken as sex slaves and the men were massacred.”

Mr Trump’s claim that Isis has targeted Christians over other groups with its beheadings also appears to be untrue.

According to a report by the U.S. government’s National Counter-Terrorism Center in 2011: “In cases where the religious affiliation of terrorism casualties could be determined, Muslims suffered between 82 and 97 per cent of terrorism-related fatalities over the preceding five years.

Trump’s ban on refugees, especially Muslims, supposedly to keep out terrorists, is also based on fear rather than truth. A 2016 analysis by the Cato Institute found that no person accepted to the U.S. as a refugee, whether Syrian or another nationality, has been involved in a major fatal terrorist attack since the Refugee Act of 1980, which instituted systematic procedures for refugees entering the U.S.

Furthermore, the San Bernardino shooters were an American citizen and a permanent resident; the New York and New Jersey bombings were carried out by a naturalized American; and Omar Mateen, responsible for the Orlando Pulse shootings, was an American citizen, as were the two brothers who carried out the Boston Marathon bombings.

As for the 9/11 hijackings of four planes, 15 of the perpetrators came from Saudi Arabia, two from the United Arab Emirates, one from Egypt, and one from Lebanon. None of those countries is included on Trump’s list of banned countries.

Countering Ignorance With Truth

Trump is a master of audience control and is brilliant at stirring up fear and hatred. As a high school teacher, I strongly believe that we must counter ignorance with truth. This is always what I have held as an important value for my students, but it is even more important in the era of Trumpian “alternative facts.”

We can begin by pledging to always speak up, whenever we hear one of these dreadful lies.

"A Fort Dodge man says he was the victim of a hate crime Tuesday morning at a demolition site where he is working in Fort Dodge.

Gary Williams said a statue was painted black and his name etched into it at the former Phillips Middle School building, 1015 Fifth Ave. N.

Williams is a demolition worker at the site where the former middle school is being converted into apartments.

He went into work around 6 a.m. and was told by a coworker that there was something on the site that was going to upset him, he said.

“I turned around down the hall, and it was a statue that had been there a long time,” Williams said. “It was a white statue made out of Styrofoam of a little boy.”

He said the statue had been spray painted black except for a small portion, where his first name had been written.

“Everybody was looking at it,” he said. “It was kind of embarrassing to me because you’re trying to say this is me.”

Williams’ girlfriend, Dontonya Edmondson, said this isn’t the first time he’s encountered racial issues on the job.

“He’s been through this before, where he got fired from a job for racism, and it took him so long to find another job,” she said. “I don’t want to go through that anymore.”

Edmondson said Williams has been passed up for jobs and promotions for which he was qualified. She believes his race played a role in that.

Williams is black.

Someone removed the statue and threw it away, she said.

Fort Dodge Police Chief Roger Porter said that because the investigation is ongoing he can’t say too much, but he did say the person police believe spray painted the statue is not from Fort Dodge.

He could not confirm that the incident would be investigated as a hate crime.

Edmondson says she’s outraged.

“No way is this acceptable,” she said.

And it’s not funny, she added.

“It’s not a joke, and it’s not a laughing matter,” she said.

Crimes like this need to be reported for action to be taken, she said.

“Everybody deserves respect,” she said. “You deserve respect. We are all God’s children.”

Williams said he’s unsure if he’ll go to work today. He spent the latter part of Tuesday at home.

He said he tries not to get upset about racism, particularly because he has health issues that could be made worse by getting worked up.

"ARNOLD, MO — Police say there is no indication 23-year-old Dustin Lockwood meant any harm when he brought two firearms onto school property at Fox High School in Arnold Tuesday. Lockwood told authorities he was at the school to pick up his sister and that he was planning to sell a rifle that school officials spotted in the backseat of his car. A search of his car turned up an additional handgun, homemade silencer, knives, ammunition and bomb-making materials. Lockwoods grandfather told the Post-Dispatch that his grandson used the explosive materials to build homemade fireworks and that had no history of violence. He indicated that his grandson may not have known it was illegal to have a gun in his car while picking up his sister from school. Fox High School was evacuated and after school activities canceled Tuesday afternoon as the bomb squad was called in to investigate. School officials said there were no threats directed against the school and the decision to evacuate was based solely on what law enforcement found in Lockwoods car. Arnold police said Thursday that the case had been turned over to the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. A complaint filed in court Wednesday indicates prosecutors will seek a federal firearms charge against Lockwood. Image via Shutterstock",0
"Update: Wrentham Fire Chief Jay McMorrow said the incident this morning involved an amount of sodium acetate and water spilling into an outlet at one of the schools labs. According to McMorrow, the outlet began to spark and smoke, prompting the departments response. He said the smoke, more than the chemical, was the issue here, and that there were no injuries. McMorrow said he believed the lab would be closed until an electrician works on the outlet. Original: The Wrentham Fire Department responded to the King Philip High School this morning for a reported chemical spill. According to the Sun Chronicle, firefighters were sent out at 8:20am and remained at the school for half an hour. No injuries were reported. According to reports, the spilled chemical was sodium acetate. Inquiries have been made with the district and the Wrentham Fire Department.

"By signing the bipartisan congressional resolution against hate, he now has committed himself to undo the damage he has caused. We hope Congress will hold his feet to the fire and ensure that he lives up to his commitment.

The bipartisan resolution recognizes “the growing prevalence of … hate groups in the United States.” It urges the President to speak out against all forms of bigotry and to commit the resources necessary to address the problem. For far too long, the country has failed to do so.

The bipartisan resolution also urges the president “to improve the reporting of hate crimes.” For far too long, the country has not had an accurate picture of the plague of bias-motivated crimes. A recent report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates that about 250,000 hate crimes occurred in 2015. Yet, the official FBI hate crime report shows that the country’s law enforcement agencies reported only about 6,000 hate crimes for that year.

By signing the bipartisan congressional resolution, President Trump has committed himself to its goals. Now, Congress must hold regular oversight hearings to ensure that the President lives up to his commitment to the country. To borrow Rep. Mark Sanford’s words, President Trump has “unearthed some demons” in our country. We hope the President recognizes and takes responsibility for what he has done and reverses course.",1
"A man was taken into custody and questioned a day after a nun was threatened at a church in Brooklyn. Law enforcement sources say he has a lengthy rap sheet. Katherine Creag reports.

Police Thursday arrested a Brooklyn man in connection with a nuns life being threatened in a church.

Derrick Gadson, 56, is charged with aggravated harassment - hate crime - and criminal possession of a controlled substance, police said. Gadson has a lengthy criminal background, law enforcement sources said.

Police said they saw a Gadson drinking liquor in the open on the corner of Parkside and Flastbush avenues and approached him. They said they discovered he open warrants.

He was also in the possession of a crack pipe, which had residue, police said. During the investigation, officials learned he was the man wanted in connection with threatening the nun and officially charged him, authorities said.

Nun Threatened by Man at Brooklyn Church: Police

Cops are investigating threats made to a Brooklyn nun by a man as a possible hate crime. Katherine Creag reports. (Published Thursday, July 6, 2017)

The news comes just a day after Sister Maria Amador was threatened by a man at a church in Prospect Heights. Police were investigating the incident as a possible hate crime.

Amador was praying in a pew around 2 p.m. Wednesday at Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph on Pacific Street, when the man, allegedly Gadson, approached her.

“I don’t believe in this because you don’t help the poor,” the man told her, according to police. When the nun didn’t respond, he said: “What did I say?”

Amador began to look toward a woman in another pew when the man said: “She can’t help you. I’m going to kill you,” according to authorities.

She ran away and screamed, “Help me! Help me! Help me!”

Amador says she stayed quiet out of fear of provoking him, but he ultimately threatened her.

“He got angrier and he came up to me more, and I said, “Something very dangerous is happening here.”

Gadson ran away when another church employee came to help, police said. Surveillance video captured the encounter between him and the nun.

“She’s targeted why? Because she’s in a habit, because she’s a religious person,” said Monsignor Kieran Harrington.

Despite escaping a potentially dangerous situation, the nun says she has no anger towards Gadson.

“I welcome him,” she said. “Because he is my brother, because he is my faith. In my faith, my example is Jesus Christ.”",1

"There is a crisis that many of us would rather not face — childhood sexual abuse.

According to Janice Palm, who works with adult survivors of sexual abuse at Shepard’s Counseling Service, one in four girls and one in six boys will be sexually abused before they turn 18.

There isn’t a part of that we want to see. I think we have a visceral reaction to the whole topic,” Palm said, speaking to Bill Radke on KUOWs The Record.

The danger in that, Palm said, is that when we don’t talk about sexual abuse, it continues.

“The talking helps,” said Dan Knoepfler, a certified sex offender treatment provider in South King County. “By having this cloud of silence over sexual assault, we’re actually making it worse for people who’ve been sexually abused.”

Knoepfler said by not talking openly about both the victims and abusers, we are exacerbating symptoms that don’t need to be exacerbated. He said because we aren’t willing to hear these stories, we make the lives of victims more miserable and difficult.

“It is a wound that needs to be exposed and cleaned so that it can heal right,” he added.

Seattle’s Mayor Ed Murray resigned this week because of allegations that he sexually abused teenage boys decades ago. Murray denies those allegations.

But this issue goes beyond the Murray case. Palm faults our societys conspiracy of silence.

“We’re all guilty of it,” she said. “This causes enormous harm. We need to understand it happens, but we also probably need more compassionate ways of dealing with it when it happens.”

Palm finds hope in her work. She said it can be hard to witness human suffering and to consider what humans being are capable of doing to other humans, but she has the lucky job of watching people reach out for help.

“All the effort that’s gone into coping and keeping this pushed aside now can go into living your life — having vitality, having spontaneity and creativity, growing relationships that are truly healthy and good,” Palm said.",1
"The suspects initially were charged with aggravated battery, a second-degree felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison. But now if convicted of aggravated battery with prejudice, a first-degree felony, they face up to 30 years.

The Florida assault – like one last August during violence in Charlottesville, Virginia – was captured on video, ultimately leading to the identification and arrests of the attackers.

The incident occurred, police said, after one of the victims accidentally bumped into Juan Carlos Lopez near a bathroom area near Ocean Drive and Sixth Street in South Beach.

That led Lopez, 21, and his companions, Luis M. Alonso Piovet, 20; Adonis Diaz, 21; and Pablo Reinaldo Romo-Figueroa, 21, to call the gay couple “maricones,” an anti-gay slur in Spanish, the Miami Herald reported, quoting police.

Surveillance video showed the assailants then repeatedly punched the two gay men in their faces, causing cuts and bruises. One of the victims was briefly knocked out from the attack, police said.

A witness, identified by police as Helmut Muller, chased the fleeing attackers, but they paused only briefly to assault him, too. Muller, who later was honored by Miami Beach officials for his heroism, received medical attention for a head laceration.

A day after the attack, police released surveillance video, asking for the publics assistance in identifying the attackers. The four men, accompanied by a lawyer, surrendered the following day, the Miami newspaper reported.

"REDWOOD CITY, CA – A 21-year-old gang member convicted of first-degree murder for the 2015 fatal shooting of a man at a house party in Half Moon Bay was sentenced to 53 years to life in prison Thursday, according to San Mateo County prosecutors. Abraham Ramirez Arroyo, of Redwood City, received the maximum sentence allowable under state law, and Judge Mark Forcum said that nothing less was deserved for the crime, which occurred around 8:30 p.m. on Aug. 29, 2015. Arroyo and his co-defendant, 37-year-old Armando Carranza of Hayward, summoned 21-year-old Felix Garduno-Vega out into the front yard and Arroyo shot him with a .380-caliber handgun after an argument, prosecutors said. They fled in Carranzas vehicle. Carranza surrendered Sept. 1, 2015, and Arroyo was apprehended in Visalia Sept. 8 after a police pursuit. The murder weapon was found in his vehicle, according to the district attorneys office. On Feb. 27 of this year, Arroyo was found guilty of first-degree murder and felony evading with enhancements for use of a firearm and gang affiliation. In addition to his prison sentence, Arroyo was also ordered to pay a $10,000 fine and $5,000 restitution to the victims family for funeral expenses, prosecutors said. Carranza was found guilty of second-degree murder with enhancements for use of a firearm and gang affiliation. He was sentenced in April to 40 years to life in prison.

"- A suspect in the fatal stabbing of a Bowie State University student will face hate crime charges, officials announced on Tuesday.

Prince Georges County States Attorney Angela Alsobrooks said 22-year-old Sean Urbanski killed 23-year-old Lt. Richard Collins III because of the color of his skin back in May on the University of Maryland campus.

RELATED: Vigil held for slain Bowie State University student Richard Collins III

Alsobrooks said officials drew the conclusion after investigating Urbanski’s background. At the time of the stabbing, police said they had discovered Urbanski was a member of a racist group on Facebook called Alt-Reich Nation, which is hateful toward women and minorities.

Collins, a senior at Bowie State University, had been out with friends celebrating his promotion to second lieutenant in the United States Army when he was attacked.

Police say Urbanski, a student at the University of Maryland, approached Collins and his friends at about 3 a.m. on May 20 as they waited for an Uber on Regents Drive near Montgomery Hall. According to investigators, Urbanski yelled at Collins before stabbing him in the chest. Collins was rushed to Prince Georges Hospital Center where he was pronounced dead.

Urbanski already faced the possibility of life without parole if convicted of murder. His trial is expected to take place in January.

Bowie State University issued a statement saying:

The Bowie State University community continues to mourn the loss of 2nd Lt. Richard Collins III, whose life was taken in a senseless act of violence. While it is encouraging to see progress being made in the criminal case, we continue to reflect on the precious life lost.

"A Galloway man is among three men charged with distributing cocaine in Atlantic City in connection with a drug ring that marketed cocaine and designer drugs online and distributed them via the mail, Acting Attorney General John J. Hoffman said on Monday. Thomas White, 31, of Galloway, is charged with first-degree distribution of cocaine and second-degree conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Additionally, Benjamin DiPilla, 28, of Ocean City, is charged with second-degree distribution of cocaine and second-degree conspiracy to distribute cocaine; and 62-year-old Thomas Bullock, of Millville, is charged with first-degree distribution of cocaine and second-degree conspiracy to distribute cocaine. DiPilla allegedly was involved in the sale of more than half an ounce of cocaine to an undercover detective on Nov. 1, 2013 at a nightclub in Atlantic City. Bullock and White allegedly sold a total of eight ounces of cocaine to the undercover detective at the same nightclub four times between July 24 and Sept. 17, 2014. Operation Skin Deep began when a detective discovered the sale of cocaine while monitoring the activities of white supremacist groups in Atlantic City. The arrests of DiPilla, Bullock and White led to the first-degree racketeering indictment charging 12 men in connection with a drug ring that marketed cocaine and designer drugs online and distributed them via the mail. Investigators also allegedly uncovered a conspiracy by the alleged leader of that ring, Christopher Castelluzzo, and three other members of the enterprise to murder a former associate and his bodyguard. Castelluzzo, 31, of Lake Hopatcong, is charged with the first-degree crime of leader of a narcotics trafficking network, which carries a sentence of life in state prison, including 25 years of parole ineligibility. He, 34-year-old Luke Atwell, of Hamilton Township (Mercer County), 45-year-old Eric Rodriguez, of Cliffside Park, and 46-year-old Henry Bracy, of New York, New York, are are also charged with first-degree conspiracy to commit murder for allegedly plotting to murder a former associate and his bodyguard in a dispute over drugs and drug money. The men allegedly took a number of steps in preparation to kill the targeted victims, but the murders were never carried out. Atwell allegedly acted as a managerial partner for the ring. Rodriguez allegedly made bulk purchases of cocaine with Castelluzzo. Others indicted include: Castelluzzo, Atwell, Lapaix, Menier, Collado and Dre are also charged with first-degree distribution of cocaine or possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. Jose Ruvalcaba, 28, of Oxnard, Calif., is a tractor-trailer driver who was arrested with Khan by detectives of the Division of Criminal Justice in a parking lot off Union Turnpike in North Bergen on April 24, 2015. Detectives allegedly found about $1.2 million in cash in the trunk of Kahns Infiniti, wrapped in bundles with duct tape. It is among the largest cash seizures in New Jersey law enforcement history. Kahn was allegedly meeting with Ruvalcaba so that Ruvalcaba could transport the cash in his tractor-trailer as payment for cocaine. Khan and Ruvalcaba are charged in the indictment with first-degree money laundering and first-degree conspiracy to commit money laundering. Jamal Johnson, 30, of Baltimore, Md., is charged with second-degree conspiracy to distribute cocaine, along with 10 of the other defendants – all except Ruvalcaba. In addition, Johnson is charged with second-degree eluding for allegedly fleeing on April 17, 2015, when detectives attempted to stop his car after he allegedly bought cocaine from Castelluzzo at the Omni Loung nightclub in Passaic, which is owned by Castelluzzo and Atwell. The drug ring allegedly used that night club for its headquarters. The detectives called off their pursuit of Johnson, but Castelluzzo was arrested at that time at the Omni Lounge. A search warrant was executed at the club, resulting in the alleged seizure of two kilograms of cocaine and nearly 400 grams of the designer drug ethylone. Atwell allegedly marketed the rings drugs on the Internet, tracked and managed the gross receipts and expenses, dealt with customers, and kept an inventory of the remaining drugs. Lapaix allegedly helped procure drugs for the ring to sell and handled the packaging and shipping of drugs. Atwell allegedly would send computer files to Lapaix containing lists of orders, including screen-names of customers, their addresses, and the amount and type of narcotics that each customer ordered. It is alleged that, when Lapaix received the files, he and/or his workers, Collado and Dre, would weigh out the drugs, package them, create tracking information, and mail each of the orders. Atwell allegedly would ensure all orders were properly filled. Lapaix obtained the necessary supplies for packaging the orders and Atwell reimbursed Lapaix for the cost of the supplies. It is alleged that Lapaix and Castelluzzo, who also allegedly engaged in street-level narcotics sales, used several cocaine suppliers, including Garcia-Hernandez, Khan and Menier.  Search warrants executed at various locations yielded approximately a quarter of a million dollars in cash, diamond jewelry, gold bars, another quarter kilogram of cocaine, numerous rounds of ammunition, firearm silencers, cocaine testing, cutting and packaging materials, and related equipment. The indictments were obtained on Thursday, March 3, by the Division of Criminal Justice Specialized Crimes Bureau. They were not announced until today because detectives are seeking several defendants who remain fugitives. The attached image of Thomas White was provided by the Attorney Generals Office",0
"Our readers may remember the September incident at the Air Force Academy Prep School involving racial slurs written outside the dorm rooms of five black cadet candidates. The Superintendent released a stern statement denouncing racism and commenting that “there is absolutely no place in our Air Force for racism.”

News agencies and social media snatched up the story with coverage as disparate as the political leanings of those publications. Internet outrage, as per usual, abounded. It now appears, however, that the investigation into the incident has concluded with, well, surprising results.

The Incident and the Investigation

Threats and racial slurs were written on the chalkboards outside the rooms of five black cadet candidates at the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Prep School, a ten-month program allowing those who would not have received automatic acceptance to USAFA a chance to train up and potentially become cadets the following year. Cadet Candidates include prior enlisted troops, recruited athletes, or those whose academics need a little extra work.

Condemnation was swift, and both parents and lawmakers called for quick action. Adam Smith, Democrat Representative from Washington and ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, called for action:

“The Air Force needs to investigate this incident thoroughly and take appropriate action. There is no place in the military for these kinds of acts. Incidents like these, even if they are performed by a single individual, offend our moral sensibilities and they can undermine the morale of service members and cadets. It is a bedrock principle that everyone in the U.S. military should be treated with dignity and respect.”

Upon further investigation, it was found that the racist messages were written by none other than of the “victims” himself! That individual is no longer a cadet candidate, and the Superintended emphasized that the incident, regardless of who is responsible, represents actions unacceptable for the Air Force and the United States Military at large.

Crying Wolf Hurts the Cause

These revelations are just one in a number of “hate crime hoaxes.” This unnamed former cadet candidate is not the first person to claim that were assaulted or discriminated against when, in reality, no such thing happened. These instances undermine the cause of racial harmony and do more harm than good.

Make no mistake, racism exists. Racially motivated acts happen. The scars of Jim Crow run deep, there is still work to be done, and there are many great Americans fighting to close whatever gaps in racial harmony remain. They are champions for a noble cause, and incidents like this undermine their efforts.

We all know the story of the boy who cried wolf. After the village sprang into action, only to find there was no wolf. The village eventually stopped responding, and the boy was eaten. This foundational children’s story teaches us the importance of telling the truth lest unbelief has dire consequences.

Such is the case with crying “racist” when none exists. One need look no further than the election of President Trump. His election was the natural progression of eight years of the “village” growing tired of reading the “Leftists Who Cried Racist.”

There is still work that needs to be done in this country to truly bring an end to racial disharmony and injustice. Fabricating a hate crime is not how to do it.",1
"Because some of my work is on police transformation, trust building, and accountability, every time I turn around, somebody else is inviting me to a “citizen’s academy”, asking me to do a police “simulator” so I can better “understand the police perspective,” which is something that as a Christian pastor who believes every person is made in the image of God, I try desperately to do. Meanwhile, as people line up to attend these “citizens academies, black bodies, also made in the image of God, black citizens, supposedly protected under the law, are steadily being used essentially as target practice without even as much of a murder or manslaughter conviction to show for it all across the country. So, basically the message is clear: if you’re a cop, it’s open season on black and brown people all across America...

So right now in the wake of the Philando Castille verdict, the killing of Charlena Lyles and the brutal beating of Nabra Hassanen (followed by the burning of a memorial built in her honor), I’m thinking that maybe the police do need a simulator: a black body living under the constant threat of police violence “simulator.” Maybe what they need is a driving while black “simulator” or a walking while black “simulator” or a standing while black “simulator” or a walking through the airport as a tennis celebrity when you get attacked “simulator,” or a lying on the ground with your hands up while you try to convince an officer that the man you’re in the street with is your patient but you get shot anyway “simulator.”

But life as a black man, woman, or child in America is not a simulation is it? Life as a gay or trans person, Muslim, Sikh, Asian, mentally ill or unhoused person is not a simulation is it? No. It’s real life for so, so many.

Unlike the police, who have the full weight, power and sympathy of the state on their side, “I feared for my life” is the generational trauma that is etched in our bones - bones which have endured centuries of unfathomable terror and pain. The whole, “I feared for my life” at the mere sight of a black man is the nightmare that we’re still trying to wake up from.",1
"A Texas man is facing jail time over several racist attacks against a Black family. Glenn Eugene Halfin, 64, pleaded guilty to a federal hate crime on July 12, according to a release from the U.S. Department of Justice.

RELATED: Racist Neighbor Who Hung Noose Outside Black Man’s Home Avoids Hate Crime, For Now

Halfin hung a baby doll with a noose around its neck outside of his African-American neighbor’s apartment in Grapevine last December. The man purchased the doll from Walmart as part of his heinous plan to intimidate Dante Petty, 28, documents filed last year revealed. The incident was videotaped and posted to Facebook by Petty, whose young daughter was also living with him.

“I just wanna show people that racism is very well ALIVE AND REAL,” Petty said in the post. “Thank God I put a camera up outside my apt because when I saw this man hanging a doll off the rails. I was so fill[ed] up with anger…”

There were other stalking and harassment incidents named in the case against Halfin, the Justice Department release said.

Grapevine Texas Man Pleads Guilty to Federal Hate Crime Against an African-American Family https://t.co/hGBXzF3oY7 — Justice Department (@TheJusticeDept) July 12, 2018

Halfin pleaded guilty to interfering with the African-American family’s housing rights in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. He had “threatened force, intimidated, and interfered with a family because of their race and occupancy of an apartment that was located directly above his own apartment,” the Justice Department said.

“No one should be afraid to go home at night,” U.S. Attorney Erin Nealy Cox said about the case. “Our community will not tolerate crimes of intimidation or bigotry, and my office will continue to prosecute all those who persecute others based on their race, color, ethnicity, or religious beliefs.”

The FBI and Grapevine Police Department investigated the case. Halfin faces a statutory maximum penalty of no more one year in federal prison and a $100,000 fine. The man’s sentencing is scheduled for October 24, the Justice Department said.

"A man who walked up to a stranger with a large rock and struck him over the head in downtown Berkeley on Tuesday has been charged with hate crime allegations and two felonies related to the attack, authorities report.

Jeffrey Frazier Pachingger, who is 38 and homeless, told police he hit the victim with a rock “because of ‘an illegal Asian takeover,’” according to court papers.

The victim, an Asian man, lost “a large amount of blood” and was taken to the hospital after the attack. Police wrote in court papers that Pachingger, who is Hispanic, said he tried to kill the man “because of his ethnicity and his belief of an ‘Asian takeover.’”

Thursday, the Alameda County district attorney’s office charged Pachingger, who already was on probation, with assault with a deadly weapon — a rock — and battery with serious bodily injury. Both counts include a special allegation that identifies them as hate crimes. Pachingger could be sent to prison if convicted.

According to court papers, the victim was at Shattuck Avenue and Center Street at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday and had bent down to unlock his bike when Pachingger “grabbed a rock, walked towards the victim from behind and hit him in the back of the head.”

The man “felt dizzy and thought he was going to lose consciousness,” police wrote, but he managed to run away because he was afraid Pachingger would strike him again.

First responders found the victim on Shattuck Avenue and Berkeley Square. There was a laceration and bruising to his head, and paramedics took him to Alta Bates Hospital for treatment.

Pachingger, meanwhile, walked down to the Berkeley Police Department, several blocks west, and admitted to having hit the man, police wrote. He also made statements admitting to racial animus in the attack, according to court papers.

As of Thursday, Pachingger remains in custody. He is scheduled to enter a plea Friday at the Rene C. Davidson Courthouse in Oakland.

"Fortune’s MPW Next Gen Summit in Laguna Niguel, Calif. continues today, and I hope you’ll tune in. The livestream is here.

While there were many outstanding moments yesterday, including this wonderful interview with Grammy Award-winning recording artist, Estelle, other discussions about the serious issues of safety, workplace sexual harassment and campus rape were very much top of mind.

To that end, four panelists Niniane Wang, founder and CEO of Evertoon, filmmaker Amy Ziering, Stanford sociology professor Michele Landis Dauber and Christa Quarles, CEO of Opentable, helped bring the #MeToo moment into broader context.

“I never thought, in my lifetime, I’d see people naming perpetrators and believing survivors,” said Ziering, the filmmaker behind The Hunting Ground, a documentary about campus rape. “This is a moment. We must seize it and we must not turn back from it.”

They offered practical tips for executives looking to stop sexual harassment at work. Wang, who was one of three women who worked tirelessly to expose harassment in the venture capital community, called for an end to the use of non-disclosure agreements to protect perpetrators. “Don’t use NDAs to silence women,” she said.

Michele Landis Dauber, who is leading the campaign to recall the judge who famously sentenced Stanford’s Brock Turner to only six months in county jail and three years probation for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman last year, said not to forget the system. “Utilize the processes of democratic accountability to hold perpetrators responsible.”

The video from their discussion is here.

I would add to their crucial advice, this recent post from Ellyn Shook, Accenture’s Chief Human Resources Officer, who is calling for a zero-tolerance policy toward sexual harassment, a value which must come from the top. “This is an opportunity for us all to hold the mirror up to ourselves as leaders – and our organizations – to identify where we can do better.” She specifically calls for accountability and transparency, and a commitment to equal representation of women in the workplace.

“Aggressively working to shift the balance to 50% men and 50% women will create a different dynamic that further strengthens a non-complicit and zero-tolerance culture,” she says.

Freedom from abuse is an underlying benefit of full representation that has yet to be fully quantified but is desperately needed.

"Over the past 16 years, the number of far-right attacks in the United States has grown to an average of 300 per year, according to a study by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point.

Since the election of right-wing US President Donald Trump in November, researchers and activists say far-right groups have been emboldened to carry out more hate crimes.

The Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), an organisation that monitors hate groups, recorded an average of 87 hate incidents a day during the ten-day period after Trump’s elections. This is five times the daily average of hate crimes recorded by the FBI in 2015.

Many of those hate incidents targeted people of colour, Muslims, Jews, members of the LGBTQ community and others.

The upsurge in racist violence has been punctuated by a handful of deadly attacks. Al Jazeera has broken down some of the most high-profile killings attributed to far-right violence in 2017.

Charlottesville’s Unite the Right rally, August 2017

On August 12, 2017, hundreds of white supremacists and neo-Nazis converged on Charlottesville, Virginia, for “Unite the Right”, the largest far-right rally to be held in the US in recent decades.

{articleGUID}

That rally was called by Jason Kessler, a former journalist and white supremacist activist, and was attended by several groups affiliated with the alt-right, a loosely knit coalition of white supremacists, white nationalists and neo-Nazis.

Unite the Right participants clashed with community members, anti-racists and anti-fascist activists throughout the city.

By the end of the day, 20-year-old James Alex Fields allegedly ploughed his car into an anti-racist march and killed 32-year-old Heather Heyer, a social worker and activist. At least 19 others were injured in the incident.

Earlier in the day, Fields was photographed marching with Vanguard America, a neo-Nazi group. He was subsequently charged with second-degree murder and a slew of felonies.

Islamophobic tirade ends with deadly stabbings, May 2017

Jeremy Christian, 35, stabbed three men for attempting to intervene when he hurled anti-Muslim insults at two teenage girls on a light rail train in Portland, Oregon.

Christian had been photographed a week earlier performing Nazi salutes at a far-right rally a week before the attack.

Two of the victims, 53-year-old Ricky John Best and 23-year-old Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, died. Micah Fletcher, who is now 21, survived the attack.

{articleGUID}

Upon entering the court room for a hearing following the killings, Christian bellowed: You call it terrorism; I call it patriotism. You hear me? Die. Death to the enemies of America. Leave this country if you hate our freedom.”

Fletcher later spoke to local media about the attack. The Muslim community, especially in Portland, needs to understand that there are a lot of us that are not going to stand by and let anybody - whether they are from here or not - scare you into thinking you cant be a part of this town, this city, this community or this country, he said.

Stabbed to death while waiting for Uber, May 2017

Sean Christopher Urbanski, 22, was charged with first- and second-degree murder after allegedly stabbing to death 23-year-old Richard Collins III, an African American university student and lieutenant in the US army, as the victim and his friends waited for an Uber on the University of Maryland’s campus.

Police did not charge Urbanski with a hate crime, but critics denounced the decision and pointed to his membership in a Facebook group called “Alt-Reich: Nation”.

{articleGUID}

“Reich” was ostensibly a reference to the German Nazi regime known as the Third Reich, and the group was full of anti-Semitic and racist content.

Collins was only three days away from graduating from nearby Bowie State University at the time of his killing.

At the time, Prince George County’s State Attorney Angela D Alsobrooks said prosecutors would “need something probably more than just a Facebook posting” to charge the assailant with a hate crime.

Black man fatally stabbed with a sword, March 2017

James Harris Jackson, a 28-year-old white man from Baltimore, travelled to New York City in the hope of killing black people, according to investigators.

Upon arriving in the city, Jackson used a sword to fatally stab 66-year-old Timothy Caughman, an African American.

Investigators later stated that Jackson admitted that he went to New York City to kill African Americans because he believed it would get more media attention.

Subsequent media profiles painted Jackson, an army veteran, as a man who harboured intense anti-black racism for most of his life.

Indian immigrant shot dead, February 2017

Adam W Purinton, a 51-year-old white man, was kicked out of a bar in Kansas City after hurling racist slurs at Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani, two immigrants from India.

Witnesses said Purinton later shouted “get out of my country” as he shot the two men, killing Kuchibhotla and injuring Madasani, both 32 years old.

{articleGUID}

The assailant was later charged with a hate crime, murder, attempted murder and weapons charges.

Sunaina Dumala, Kuchibhotla’s widow, told media outlets she was already concerned about anti-immigrant violence before the attack that left her husband dead.

He did not deserve a death like this, Dumala, who was planning her first child with her husband, said at the time.",1
"In this week’s roundup: the waning power of the KKK, the argument over whether a New Mexico school shooter was a racist finally seems settled, and a meme turns “Black Panther” hatred on its head.

In 2017, the number of active Ku Klux Klan chapters dropped by nearly 45 percent, from 130 in 2016 to 72 the following year, according to a new report from the Southern Poverty Law Center.

These figures provide hard data for a trend we’ve been hearing about anecdotally: the rapidly waning importance of the KKK within the white supremacist ecosystem. The Klan may have been the driving force in grass-roots American white supremacy since the 1860s, but the new wave of hate seems to have largely passed it by.



“The new alt-right type of white supremacist, the type of people who showed up at Charlottesville, are not interested in the KKK or its goofy look, crazy robes or secret handshakes,” said Heidi Beirich, the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project director. “The Klan is frankly being rejected in theses circles.”



The organizers of the Charlottesville, Virginia, rally explicitly planned to turn away any KKK members who showed up in full robe-and-hood regalia. It was part of a deliberate rebranding of white supremacy away from the signifiers of the KKK and toward something more modern, clean cut and seemingly respectable.



Think about white supremacist figurehead Richard Spencer, who wears businesses suits, has multiple college degrees and runs a nonprofit think tank. Not exactly the KKK. Consider The Daily Stormer publisher Andrew Anglin, who traffics in tech-savvy, irony-drenched absurdism. Neither’s aesthetic is related to the popular conception of the KKK, even if their ideologies are rooted in the same racist traditions.

While it’s impossible to determine whether the decline of the KKK is directly feeding the rise of other white supremacist factions, the Southern Poverty Law Center’s report found that other parts of the hate universe grew substantially last year. For example, the number of active neo-Nazi groups swelled from 99 to 121 in 2017.



Beirich said the Southern Poverty Law Center classifies hate groups as active if they’ve done activities such as spreading fliers, holding meetings, burning crosses or putting out a newsletter in the calendar year.

The center’s findings echo those of a report put out by the Anti-Defamation League in 2016 about the Klan. The report, called “Tattered Robes,” pointed out that, even in contrast with the rest of the far-right hate movement, Klan groups are marked by an especially high level of instability:

More than half of the currently active Klan groups were formed only in the last five years. This is not, as it may first seem, a sign of growth, but rather illustrates how short-lived today’s Ku Klux Klan groups actually tend to be. …



While a few longstanding Klan groups still exist, they continue to fade away. Just a decade ago, Klan groups such as the White Camelia Knights, the Mississippi White Knights, and the Church of the National Knights exhibited consistent activity. Today, all three are mere shadows of their former selves.

Even so, at least one Klan leader insists his group’s fortunes are on the rise. Last year, Chris Barker, an imperial wizard of the Loyal White Knights of the KKK, told the Independent that the election of President Donald Trump has done wonders for his recruiting.

“I’ve been doing this for over 20 years, and I haven’t seen the Klan grow at the pace it’s growing now,” Barker said. “I mean, it’s even hard to keep track of the numbers you’ve got ’cause there’s so many coming in.”

However, as we cautioned last week, it’s important to treat anything said by a hate group leader, especially with regard to things such as membership numbers, with a degree of skepticism.

He is, he isn’t, he is alt-right

After the Southern Poverty Law Center included 21-year-old New Mexico killer William Atchison on its list of alt-right murderers earlier this month, authorities cried foul.

Brice Current, internal affairs captain for the San Juan County Sheriff’s Office, the agency overseeing the investigation, called the report an attempt to politicize the shootings.

“I don’t think this has anything to do with a political agenda,” Current told The Associated Press.

But as the Daily Beast reported earlier, there’s plenty of evidence linking Atchison with the movement. He spent a lot of time on white supremacy websites, posting racist comments and memes.

More evidence that Atchison was driven by hate emerged this week. His autopsy report noted that he had faint ink markings on his left leg, including a swastika and the letters “SS,” an abbreviation for an elite Nazi military unit. Atchison also had “build wall” written on his leg, an apparent reference to Trump’s campaign promise to build a border wall between Mexico and the United States.

Both of Atchison’s victims were Latino.

Hate crime roundup: From dumb kids to baseball bats and life in prison

On Wednesday, Stanley Vernon Majors was sentenced to life in prison without parole in Oklahoma for killing his Lebanese neighbor. Majors was convicted earlier this month of killing 37-year-old Khalid Jabara in August 2016. Prosecutors said Majors subjected Jabara and his family to racist abuse for years before the fatal attack.

In Paradise Valley, Arizona, a group of high school kids reportedly is facing discipline after they lay down in the shape of a swastika , took a photo and shared it on Snapchat. The image went viral and the school is investigating.

Outside Chicago, a man has been charged with a hate crime after he attacked an African American mother and her son as they stood at a bus stop last week. Robert P. Morris, 54, allegedly called the woman and her son a racial slur and advanced toward them holding a knife. He then allegedly flipped a bench on which the 12-year-old boy was sitting, causing the boy to hit his head, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. Morris was denied bail.



causing the boy to hit his head, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. Morris was denied bail. A woman was arrested and booked last week under Washington state’s hate crime law for allegedly threatening two teens with a baseball bat and shouting racial slurs, The Seattle Times reported.



‘This movie isn’t for you’

The movie “Black Panther” has received nearly universal praise from critics.

Most fans are similarly effusive, but alt-right trolls have attempted to sabotage the film by circulating hoaxes about black people assaulting whites during screenings. The goal, of course, is to convert an event that’s all about celebrating black achievement into something reinforcing the racist stereotype of omnipresent black violence.

However, as The Daily Dot reports, some internet jokesters have turned this racist fake news into a pretty solid meme mocking the obviously false stories by folding it into increasingly ridiculous scenarios:

I tried to see Black Panther but I was accosted by a gang of black youths, they said “this movie isn’t for you, whitey!” then pinned me down and carved “Go see Peter Rabbit instead” into my forehead. – @pixelatedboat

I want to see Black Panther but when I tried a gang of black youths said “this movie isn’t for you” before rolling me up into a ball shape and dunking me through a nearby basketball hoop. – @Mr_Finn_McCool

I tried to see Black Panther but a teenager shouted “this movie’s not for you” and then a graffiti artist tagged me, then another guy covered me in clay and sold me at an art auction? I fetched $1700. – @MKupperman

Lulz.

"MAHWAH, N.J. — Additional charges were filed against a man police found with a .40-caliber handgun in the Mason Jar parking lot Sept. 5, police said. Police received an anonymous call that a silver Mercury was traveling to the restaurant and that one of the occupants may have had a handgun in his or her possession, Batelli said. Michael DiBiasi, 32, was arrested after police learned he did not have a permit to carry the gun, Batelli said, and had never even applied for one. He was charged with possession of handgun without first obtaining a permit to carry. Police said they think Dibiasi was at the restaurant to settle some kind of dispute. A check by police revealed that the Glock 32 gun was reported lost by the Collier County Sheriffs Department, Batelli said, and was allegedly stolen from a Naples, Florida gun range. Mahwah and Oakland police arrested DiBiasi at his Oakland home, the chief said. He was charged with possession of a weapons for an unlawful purpose and receiving stolen property. Superior Court Judge James Guida set DiBiasis bail at $50,000 with no 10 percent option, police said. He was released after posting bond pending a court hearing.

"VICTORIA, Texas - Hate may have burned down the Victoria Islamic Center, but love and compassion will see it built again.

The mosque serving the South Texas community was destroyed in a fire on Jan. 28, 2017, which investigators believe was set intentionally. The flames flickering in the night sky were an ugly sight for members of the congregation and seemed to send an even uglier message.

Thats like somebody giving you an eviction notice, said Omar Rachid, a spokesman for the Victoria Islamic Center.

Federal prosecutors have charged Marq Vincent Perez with a hate crime for allegedly starting the fire.

READ MORE: Fast facts to know in case against Marq Vincent Perez, man charged in Victoria mosque fire

While he is scheduled for trial in April, the members of the congregation are focused on rebuilding, with the foundation for a new mosque being poured on Wednesday.

Money from around the globe has fueled the congregations effort. A GoFundMe page shows more than $1.1 million raised for the project, and Rachid said the center has received other checks, too.

We received donations from 90 countries, he said, noting that the center is still several hundred thousand dollars short of the amount it needs to complete the project.

In the meantime, the congregation worships in another building to the side, already anticipating the mosque they hope will be completed in July.

I feel very relieved. You know, I feel very happy. I cant wait until its finished, said Ibrahim Arabi as he arrived for Fridays services.

Though one man may have destroyed their place of worship, many more will have helped to build it anew.

Human kindness is really, truly the most beautiful thing you can ever observe, Rachid said.

BAINBRIDGE, Ga. (WCTV) -- Bainbridge police say someone threw fireworks into a small crowd. The sparks burned an 11-year-old girl and injured the top of her head.

I was scared. I thought I was going to die. Brianna Thomas said.

Briannas mother, Shontrel Thomas, explained what happened.

The flames came straight to my babys hair. My first reaction was to grab my baby and pat it because I saw smoke.

The flames and smoke were from fireworks that hit Brianna in the head.

Thomas says she, Brianna, and some friends were waiting for the community fireworks display to start at the Boat Basin in Bainbridge Tuesday night.

Thats when a white pickup truck pulled up to them near Shotwell and River Streets.

He just pulled up to the stop sign and he waited to for the traffic to clear, and he hollered out, white power and a curse word. Thomas said.

Thomas says the next thing they knew, someone in the truck of white men, threw the firework.

It was the kind that when you light it, it kind of shoots off. Its supposed to shoot up, but it shot out and the sparks went in every direction. She said.

Brianna says it burned her hair and the parts of her scalp in the top of her head.

Her grandmother, Annette Green, said, I was speechless. I couldnt believe it. I thought, oh my, God, she couldve been killed. This is a hideous crime. Its something that shouldnt happen. Its not okay.

Thomas said, Afterwards, when we were riding home, the least little explosion of fireworks had her jumping. She was like, I cant believe this happened on the day before my birthday. Its supposed to be something happy and celebrating, and it turned negative.

Police say theyre investigating the incident as a possible hate crime.

The incident happened the night before Briannas 12th birthday. To cheer her up, a 911 dispatcher - joined by colleagues and local officials - threw her a birthday party.

Authorities say a second incident happened around 10 p.m. during the fireworks celebration at the boat basin. Investigators say man and his wife and daughter were walking by a crowd, when someone threw fireworks at them. Police say this was a separate and unrelated incident.

Anyone with any information on either of the incidents is urged to call Bainbridge Public Safety at 229-248-2038.

STAMFORD — A homeless man charged with a hate crime for smearing a swastika with his feces outside the Rich Forum Media Center has been sent to the hospital for a mental health evaluation after an apparent similar incident in his holding cell.

Robin Spearman, 58, was scheduled to be arraigned Thursday morning, but Senior Assistant State’s Attorney Mitchell Rubin said he had been sent to Stamford Hospital.

Stamford desk Sgt. Carl Strate, who is in charge of sending prisoners to the courthouse for their arraignments, said Spearman went to the hospital for a psych evaluation.

Strate declined to say what caused Spearman to be taken to the hospital, but one court official said he smeared feces all over his cell Thursday morning.

Spearman, who was convicted of a 2007 armed robbery and sentenced to 11 years in jail, is being held on a $100,000 court appearance bond. He has been charged with intimidation based on bigotry or bias, creating a public disturbance and possession of drug paraphernalia. He is expected to appear at the courthouse for his arraignment on Friday.

Lauren Steinberg, director of the Jewish Foundation of Greater Stamford, New Canaan and Darien’s Jewish Community Relations Council, praised the police for making a quick arrest.

“We applaud the police for their work. We also applaud the work of the Connecticut Legislature for passing the strongest hate crimes legislation in the country earlier this month — legislation that clearly demonstrates that bigotry and hatred are not tolerated here,” Steinberg said.

Rich Forum security officers provided police with blurry video footage of a man holding a coffee cup and drawing the swastika and a Star of David on a glass panel near the Atlantic Street entrance to the theater just before 1 p.m. Sunday, according to Spearman’s arrest affidavit.

The cup, which was found the next morning and taken by police as evidence, contained human feces, the arrest warrant said.

According to the warrant, investigators Angel Gonzalez and Chris Friel used city traffic cameras to trace the movements of the suspect to Pacific Street, south of Dock Street in the city’s South End.

Police also found a much clearer picture of the suspect down the street from the theater at Stamford News and Deli, where the man is seen walking into the store and picking up a cup and leaving, the affidavit said. The cup is the same type the police found with feces in it, the affidavit said.

Gonzalez and Friel canvassed the South End and found Spearman Wednesday afternoon standing at the corner of Atlantic and Henry streets.

Based on his own observations from the videos, Friel identified Spearman as the suspect and he was taken into custody.

"How do you talk with your children about the Sandy Hook school shooting without traumatizing or frightening them? Thats the question Clawson parents are sure to be asking themselves and one another in the wake of Fridays tragedy. What do you tell them? How much detail to you tell them? How do you help them make sense of what they may already have heard from friends or on television, or read via social media? Lauren Hutchinson, MA, LMFT, is a nationally-recognized child and family therapist and parenting coach with a practice in Bellevue, WA. She says the first step is for parents is to turn off the TV. We dont want to have the TV playing in the background all the time. It isnt helpful and the news is traumatizing for kids to watch.  Here are other age-appropriate tips: Ages 7 and younger: Hutchinson says, you want to shield them from the media coverage completely and parents should not initiate a conversation about the event because kids this age cannot make sense of what has happened. Kids dont need to know the specific details of the event, like that the shooter was dressed all in black. We forget that children, especially ages seven and younger, hold tight to those kinds of negative images, she says. Ages 7 to 12: Hutchinson says, you might provide them with basic information and reassure them. The most important thing for kids this age is to know that they are safe. Talk about how parents and school teachers and staff work hard to protect kids and do tell them that the police got the bad guy, she says. Hutchinson encoureages parents to read the childs cues and let them bring up what he or she wants to talk about. Hutchinson says it is important for parents to not invalidate feelings and remember kids will take their cue from your responses. While we may be feeling weepy or mesmerized by the TV coverage, we need to remember our kids are watching us.  She says that like all parents, she is curious about many details of the case but will wait until after her kids are asleep to go online and read the news coverage. Telling her own children: Hutchinson says she will approach the conversations differently with her two boys because of their ages. My 7th grader will have access to friends with smart phones and may have already heard about the event, she says. With him Im going to answer questions, not rehash the event, and respond to specific questions and concerns he has. With adolescents, there is an opportunity to talk in greater depth and have a conversation about what happened, what might make someone do something like this, etc. With my 10-year-old, I will tell him what happened in brief, non-descriptive language. Something really terrible happened at a school in Connecticut today. A gunman shot some students and adults. Many families and the community are heartbroken over the senselessness of this act, She says. Then I am going to hone in on him and his response. This may be enough information for him; other kids may seek greater detail. Either is okay. Be honest and direct, without too many details.One of the most helpful things parents can do for their children, now and in the weeks ahead says Hutchinson, is to take action. (Children) need a meaningful way to express their emotions and process what happened. For her own children, her family will be lighting a candle and saying a prayer for the victims and their families. Rituals are important, especially during times like these, for comfort and healing.

"In a 3-2 decision Tuesday, the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals ruled that anti-gay assaults are not protected under the states hate crime law, according to court documents obtained by ABC News. The decision emerged from the State of West Virginia vs. Steward Butler case, which involves an April 2015 incident during which Butler allegedly directed homophobic slurs at two men he saw kissing on the sidewalk while at a stoplight before getting out of his car and striking both victims in the face with his fist, according to court documents.On May 21, 2015, a Cabell County grand jury issued an indictment against Butler, charging him with battery and violations of an individuals civil rights under West Virginia law. Butler challenged those indictments and the applicability of the law to his actions.According to the court, under West Virginia law it is unlawful to threaten, injure, intimidate or oppress any individual because of their race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, political affiliation or sex. However, West Virginias Supreme Court agreed that the word sex has ambiguous meaning and it is unclear if the law protects individuals based on sexual orientation A review of similar laws from other states demonstrated that there are two distinct categories of potential discrimination: discrimination based on sex and discrimination based on sexual orientation, the court decision states. West Virginia legislature could have included sexual orientation as an area of protection ... [as] [n]umerous other states have done.Currently, West Virginia and five other states have hate crime protection laws that list either sex or gender, 20 states list either sex or gender in addition to sexual orientation and six states list only sexual orientation.Citing Blacks Law Dictionary definition of sex as meaning the sum of the peculiarities of structure and function that distinguish a male from a female organism;gender and the dictionarys definition of sexual orientation as a persons predisposition or inclination toward sexual activity or behavior with other males or females, the court ruled that they could not make claims that the law included both.Chief Justice Allen Loughry said that the court was bound to apply the law as it stands and that it cannot expand the word sex to include sexual orientation. As a result, the court ruled that Butlers battery charges would remain, but charges for violating an individuals civil rights would be dropped.Tuesdays ruling by the West Virginia Supreme Court was a step in the wrong direction, GLAAD s President and CEO, Sarah Kate Ellis, told ABC News in a statement. At a time when anti-LGBTQ hate violence is on the rise, this ruling reiterates the need to advocate for LGBTQ-inclusive hate-crime laws in all states across the nation.Since 1987, there have been at least 26 attempts to amend the statute in West Virginia to include sexual orientation but each of those attempts failed.Justice Loughry stated in court documents that it is important to remember that [i]t is not for this Court arbitrarily to read into a statute that which it does not say. Just as courts are not to eliminate through judicial interpretation words that were purposely included, we are obliged not to add to statutes something the Legislature purposely omitted.However, in dissent, Justice Margaret L. Workman and Justice Robin Jean Davis took issue with the opinion delivered by Justice Loughry saying it was overly simplistic and constricted.If a man stands on a corner kissing a man and is beaten because he is kissing a man, has he been assaulted because of his sex, Justice Margaret L. Workman asked in her dissenting opinion . Yes, but not simply because he possesses male anatomical parts; rather, the crime occurred because he was perceived to be acting outside the social expectations of how a man should behave with a man. But for his sex, he would not have been attacked.",1

"Protecting Vulnerable Communities from Hate Crime





On July 17th, 2018, Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis introduced a motion to the LA Board of Supervisors acknowledging the Hate Violence Prevention Partnership of Los Angeles (HVPPLA), which includes MPAC, Bienestar Human Services, the Los Angeles Brotherhood Crusade and the California Conference for Equality and Justice. Together with HVPPLA, we raise awareness, build community strength and intergroup solidarity to counter hate crimes perpetrated against American Muslims and other vulnerable communities. With hate crimes on the rise in LA County for the third year in a row, this work is essential for the safety and well being of ourselves and our neighbors.

American Muslims stand in solidarity with all vulnerable communities targeted by hate crimes. Our communities intersect with many others, as Muslims can also be LGBTQ, African-American, Latino and South Asian. Muslims cross almost every section of society where hate crimes are on the rise.

We are especially grateful for the County of Los Angeles addressing the underreporting of hate crimes, as victims in our communities may fear exposure of their immigration status or countries of origin due to this administration’s policies like the Muslim Travel Ban.

On a national level, we are engaging with the U.S. Commission on Human Rights by offering recommendations urging them to address the rising threat of violent bigotry towards our communities, and outlining the deficiencies within the federal government that keep it from adequately protecting vulnerable communities.

We will continue to advocate for making the reporting of hate crimes more accessible and more effective, toward increased safety for all of our communities.",1

"PHOENIX, AZ – The six-month-old boy who was sent to the hospital after his father attacked him has died, police say. Robert Resendiz, 30, had told police that he had bent the child nearly in half when he wouldnt stop crying. The incident happened on Dec. 19 and the child died two days later. Police just confirmed the death on Tuesday. Police had arrived at Resendizs home by 12th Street and Camelback Road on Tuesday where they found the child unconscious. They performed CPR until paramedics took over. They transported him to Phoenix Childrens Hospital where doctors diagnosed the child with internal injuries, bruising, and a broken wrist. At the time, doctors told police that it was unlikely the child would survive his injuries. Resendiz was originally booked into jail on child abuse charges and held on $250,000.

"Once again a self-avowed “white nationalist” has carried out a violent attack on innocent Americans. And, once again, political leaders, the media and the general public have been extremely reluctant to call the incident what it is: terrorism.

According to witnesses, on May 26, Jeremy Joseph Christian, a 35 year-old man with a criminal record and history of hate speech, spewed anti-Muslim rhetoric at a teenager wearing hijab and her non-Muslim, African American friend on a train in Portland, Oregon. When three men rose to protect the girls, he stabbed them, killing two and seriously injuring a third. Once in custody he allegedly boasted, “I just stabbed a bunch of mother—rs in the neck. . . . I can die in prison a happy man.”

The attack has been designated a “hate crime” and condemned by everyone from the president to the mayor of Portland. However legally accurate it may be, “hate crime” does not do justice to the victims nor accurately describe what occurred. There is a disturbing tendency to treat such attacks as isolated incidents perpetrated by disturbed individuals rather than seeing them as part of a larger pattern of violent extremism. A hate crime it may have been, but the stabbings were also an act of terrorism.

Hate crime does not describe what occurred. A hate crime it may have been, but the stabbings were also an act of terrorism.

Based on the investigation so far, Christian fits the pattern of a lone-wolf terrorist. He may not have belonged to any specific organization, but his online activity, statements and actions place him firmly within the White supremacist camp. This broad, diffuse ideological movement goes by many names: Christian Identify, White Nationalism, neo-Nazi, etc. The movement’s diverse groups share certain beliefs: a distrust of government (and sometimes a denial of its authority), racism, antisemitism, Islamaphobia, and ethnocentrism.

Most extremist groups that espouse this ideology are careful to avoid overtly inciting violence, but they know perfectly well that some of their fellow travelers will get the hint and strike a blow for their cause. Like Dylan Roof, who murdered nine African Americans at a Charleston, South Carolina church in 2015, Christian turned hate speech into hateful action. Ideology motivated both men, and their actions clearly spread fear, which makes what they did terrorism.

Critics will object that Roof and Christian were at best emotionally unstable and at worst mentally ill individuals driven by person pathology, nothing more. This assertion may be true, but it also denies the larger context in which the men operated. Omar Mateen, the perpetrator of the 2016 Orlando nightclub massacre, also showed signs of personal pathology, but that did not stop us from labeled an ISIS terrorist, even though he apparently had no official ties with the group. Many individuals who carry out terrorist attacks are unstable, but they would not act as they do without an ideological focus. When the perpetrator is a Muslim, we emphasize his ideological convictions. When he is a White supremacist, we emphasize his personal pathology.",1

"While Stanford University saw a decline in some crimes in 2016 — alcohol arrests, drug violations and domestic violence, for example — others increased, including sexual offenses and hate crimes.

Stanford released on Friday its annual Safety, Security and Fire Report, which details crimes statistics the university is required to report publicly under federal law. The data includes students, faculty, staff and campus visitors.

In 2016, 45 sexual offenses were reported to university officials, up from 39 the prior year and 30 in 2014.

Last years total includes 33 rapes (which includes sodomy, sexual assault with an object and oral copulation; three cases involved multiple counts of sexual assault, resulting in 30 unique reports) and 12 incidents of fondling, defined by the university as the touching of private body parts of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of his/her age or because of his/her temporary or permanent mental incapacity.

In 2015, there were 25 reported rapes and 11 instances of fondling, according to the report.

Last year, there were no reports of dating violence (compared to one the year prior) and lower rates of domestic violence (nine total cases compared to 12 in 2015). Stalking was slightly up in 2016, however, with 21 total cases compared to 18 the year before.

The vast majority of sexual offenses were reported to the universitys Title IX office, which is charged with the response, investigation and adjudication of incidents that fall under the federal anti-discrimination law, according to a university press release on the safety report.

Lauren Schoenthaler, senior vice provost for institutional equity and access, said in the release that Stanford is hopeful the uptick is a reflection that more of our students are willing to engage with the Title IX office to resolve and redress their concerns.

The press release attributes the rise in sexual offenses to increasing awareness of students regarding what conduct constitutes an assault, and a decreasing stigma around bringing forward a report.

Stanford has taken steps in recent years to ease the reporting process for people who have experienced sexual violence, including by promoting the availability of a 24/7 confidential support team, adding new training for all incoming undergraduates and piloting an online platform that allows students to record sexual misconduct and decide later if they want to pursue a formal investigation.

This summer, the university also released a Title IX progress report with a higher level of detail on reports of sexual violence. The university said it intends to release such a report annually.

Of the reported rapes in 2016, 26 took place in student residences. Two were reported to the Palo Alto Police Department, and five were investigated by both Stanfords Title IX office and police at the request of the victim, the release states. No charges or convictions were made in those five cases, according to the university. In 10 cases, the suspects were unknown or the person who said they were assaulted declined to identify the suspect.

Of the 11 reported rapes Stanford investigated, about half (five) resulted in formal hearings and half (five) in non-hearing resolutions, in which the university decides that a reasonable hearing panel could find that the alleged conduct occurred, and both parties agree to an outcome such as a campus ban or stay-away order instead of proceeding to a formal hearing with a potential finding of responsibility. Non-hearing resolutions cannot be appealed.

The five hearings resulted in three findings of responsibility with penalties of suspension and two findings of no responsibility, according to Stanford. The university issued a no-charge decision in one case involving a domestic violence report — meaning the Title IX coordinator concluded that a hearing panel could not find by the preponderance of the evidence standard (its more likely than not that the conduct occurred), according to the report.

Of the nine reports of domestic violence in 2016, Stanford investigated the four in which students were involved. Two cases resulted in non-hearing resolutions; one in a hearing with a finding of responsibility; and one in a no-charge decision.

Most of the stalking reports involved a Stanford-affiliated victim receiving unwanted attention from someone outside of the Stanford community, the release states. In the five cases where the reported stalker was a Stanford student, the university issued one non-hearing resolution, two informal interventions (directing the individual to cease contact) and no action in the last case at the request of the person who was reportedly stalked.

There were four aggravated assaults reported last year, two of which were associated with a student residence.

Though reports of hate crimes are still relatively low on Stanfords campus, they have doubled since 2014. There were three hate crime reports in 2014, two in 2015 and six last year.

In 2016, Stanford saw three vandalism incidents based on religion/nationality in which swastikas were painted on signs on campus, another vandalism case in which a racial epithet was marked on a restroom mirror, one reported threat of physical violence that targeted an individual based on perceived sexual orientation and one reported battery targeting an individual based on race, according to the report.

In other crime categories, Stanford saw a decrease in alcohol arrests — 62 in 2016 compared to 70 in 2015. There was one fewer drug arrest (19) in 2016 compared to the year before.

Burglary rates remained steady in 2016, with 56 total reports in 2016 compared to 57 the year before.

The university press release quotes Stanford Department of Public Safety Director Laura Wilson encouraging all members of the Stanford community to report crimes.

With the current national discussion about race and fears about what could happen if one is undocumented, Wilson said it was important that community members not be reluctant to involve law enforcement and emergency medical personnel, the release states.

If someone needs medical attention or if you think they pose a threat to themselves or to others, please use the resources which are available, including the police and emergency medical personnel, Wilson said. Failing to call 911 could result in a tragic outcome and that would be antithetical to the value we place on the safety and well-being of our community.

"A Branson mom says her son was targeted by racist graffiti. She calls it a hate crime. Police say was just kids messing around.

“This is a hate crime. It’s a hate crime because it was done with intent to hurt someone and the basis of it was the color of our skin,” said Sade Shine.

Shine says on Tuesday night, she came home to chalk drawings in the parking lot outside of her apartment building. She took photos that show that some of the drawings were swastikas, and the word Nazi.

“At first we didn’t notice it because it was in the form of chalk. And once we realized that some of them were actually Nazi signs, and the word ‘Nazi’ written out, we horrified. We couldn’t believe that children had taken the the time to write racist graffiti and they targeted my son. Wrote a note, which was threatening, in my opinion,” said Shine.

One of her photos shows part of the message, it reads “I see you Savon.”

Savon is Shine’s seven-year-old son.

“He’s not familiar with a swastika, he doesn’t know what it is. Now he does. And so, as a parent, it’s kind of heartbreaking to have to watch your child mature before you’re really ready for them to,” said Shine.

Shine shot video of property managers washing away the chalk Wednesday morning. She also called the police.

Branson Police Department Lieutenant Mike Hoag said, “The officer did make contact with all the kids involved, who were all around 12 years old. They were drawing chalk drawings of all kinds of kids things, rainbows, smiley faces, you name it. There were several swastikas drawn.”

He says officers investigated the incident, made a report, and talked to the kids’ parents.

“They weren’t angry, they didn’t hate anybody involved in that area. It was just kids doing dumb kid stuff,” said Hoag.

Hoag says police determined no crime was committed.

“We do take the possibility of any crime, especially a hate crime very seriously, but this was not that case,” he said.

But Shine doesn’t agree.

She said, “We know that they knew what they were doing, and that they knew what they were doing was racial.”

Shine says she feels like her family was targeted.

“Seeing this was kind of a harsh reality and a hard wake-up call to the fact that we’re black and we live in an all-white community. And that there are people in that community who don’t accept us,” Shine said.

She says it makes her fear for her son’s safety.

“Moving forward, I’m going to continue to teach him to love himself and not to let anyone make him feel less than, but I’m also going to teach him to watch for the signs, things that can potentially bring harm to him,” said Shine.",1

"Two Congressional Democrats have introduced bills in Congress to ban the gay and trans panic defenses.

Representative Joseph Kennedy (D-MA) and Senator Edward Markey (D-MA) introduced the Gay & Trans Panic Defense Prohibition Act in their respective chambers. The bill would ban the gay and trans panic defense in federal courts.

While it’s not an officially recognized defense strategy, the gay panic defense is used in cases where a straight person assaults or kills a gay person. Instead of saying they didn’t do it, the defendant argues that they were so upset that a gay person made a sexual advance towards them that they momentarily lost control, helping them to claim insanity or diminished capacity.

The related trans panic defense argues that the defendant lost control when they found out that the victim is transgender.

Kennedy said that admitting to killing someone because they’re gay or transgender “is not a defense, it is a hate crime.”

“Legal loopholes written into our laws that seek to justify violent attacks against our gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender neighbors should never have existed in the first place,” Kennedy said.

In April, the American Bar Association sent a letter to Markey asking for the gay and trans panic defense to be banned.

“These defenses have no place in either our society or justice system and should be legislated out of existence,” the letter said. The American Bar Association adopted a resolution calling for an end to the defense in 2013.

The gay panic defense has been used in several prominent cases. It gained national attention in a 1995 case where a gay man, Scott Amedure, told his straight friend Jonathan Schmitz that he was attracted to him on the Jenny Jones Show.

Three days later, Schmitz shot Amedure and turned himself into police, and he argued in court that he was “embarrassed” on national TV. He avoided a first-degree murder conviction and was convicted of second-degree murder.

The men who killed Matthew Shepard also tried to argue that they were “enraged” to the point of murder because Shepard made a sexual advance toward them. The judge did not allow that defense, and they later changed their story.

The trans panic defense was used by the three men who killed Gwen Araujo in 2004. After having sex with the transgender teen, the men found out that she was transgender.

They called it “a sexual violation ‘so deep it’s almost primal’.” Their first trial ended in a jury deadlock.

California, Illinois, and Rhode Island have already banned the gay and trans panic defense.

"ANTIOCH, CA -- Contra Costa firefighters were working two significant East County fires this afternoon, a day when several triple-digit temperatures were recorded in the eastern reaches of the Bay Area. A two-alarm fire in the 4300 block of Deer Hill Lane in southeast Antioch, about a quarter-mile south of the Kaiser Permanente hospital on Deer Valley Road, appears to have started about 5:12 p.m. as a car fire, but by 5:30 flames had spread to at least one structure and several vehicles in a nearby salvage yard. Contra Costa County Fire Protection District Capt. Lisa Martinez said firefighters were still on the scene at 6:15 p.m., but had little other specific information. That fire was still being battled at that time. Earlier today, at about 1:30 p.m., East Contra Costa Fire Protection District and CalFire firefighters responded to a grass fire off Armstrong Road, southwest of Byron Airport and east of Vasco Road. Thirteen acres of grassland burned before the blaze was contained the East County fire district said.

The suspect is a 17-year-old boy who was living at Devereux Brandywine, a behavioral health facility, the DA said. His identity is not being released by authorities because he is a minor. This juvenile engaged in a brutal attack on the victim, then showed callous disregard for her life, DA Tom Hogan said. (He) is lucky that the victim did not die. If the victim had not been found by her family, the defendant would be facing murder charges. The boy escaped from the facility on Feb. 22, and headed to an East Brandywine Township home on the 100 block of Creek Road in the early morning hours, according to the DA. The resident, a 72-year-old woman, was not at home between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m., and thats when the suspect burglarized the home, stealing credit cards, officials said. Later that night at around 7:30 p.m., as she walked back into her home, the 17-year-old attacked her from behind, the DA said. He strangled her as she fought back and said, Youll be with Jesus soon. The woman eventually passed out. He then covered her head with a shopping bag, and tied her arms behind her back with zip ties, duct tape, and cloth, the DA said. Then he tossed her into a storage space underneath the steps. That was Wednesday night. She stayed there, without food and water, until she was discovered on Sunday morning, Feb. 26, when a family member checked in on her. Authorities said the woman was rushed to Paoli Hospital, where she was treated for dehydration, malnourishment, and blunt force injuries sustained in the assault. She is going to survive, police said. The victim showed remarkable courage and resilience in surviving the ordeal, Hogan said. She is strong physically and mentally, and will recover with the help of her family. Police were able to trace the suspect because he used the victims stolen credit cards in Maryland. Store footage shows his face as he makes the purchase. Further evidence ties a pair of boots in his possession to distinctive footprints left at the scene. He was arrested on March 1 and charged with attempted homicide, robbery, burglary, aggravated assault, strangulation, and related charges, the DAs office said. Hogan added that they will move to have the suspect tried as an adult. A public detention hearing is set for March 3. Anyone who has any further information on this case should contact Chester County Detective Ben Martin at (610) 344-6866. Pictured above is the storage space in which the victim was held.

Both dirt bikes and ATVs are banned in NYC. Even so, some city residents — NYC Police Commissioner Bill Bratton labeled them clowns and knuckleheads at the presser, among other things — drive them around the city each year when the weather warms up, Bratton said, often in large groups. The small vehicles disrupt traffic and make roads and sidewalks less safe, Bratton said, adding that the NYPD attributed three shootings last year to gunmen riding dirt bikes. So, in anticipation of this years riding season, the department is actively searching for and impounding the vehicles, he said. The NYPD has already seized 312 vehicles so far in 2016, according to Chief Carlos Gomez — double their haul during the first quarter of 2015.

"A 21-year-old Michigan woman pleaded guilty Monday to fabricating a “hate crime” in which an unknown white male approached her and slashed her face with a safety-pin, local news outlets are reporting.

University of Michigan student Halley Bass admitted she scratched her own face with a pin after becoming frightened by a classroom discussion in her women’s literature class. (RELATED: The Worst Hoax ‘Hate Crimes’ Of 2016)

“I had been in a discussion in my women’s lit weirdly and there were a few people in my class that sort of said some things that scared me,” Bass said. She claims she was “suffering from depression at the time.”

Bass originally “claimed her attack was part of the surge in hate crimes following the election of Donald Trump a week earlier,” MLive.com reports. She told police after the fake attack that she believed she was targeted because of a safety-pin she was wearing.

“The significance of the safety pins is that … to sort of like to show a solidarity with immigrants who feel threatened by Brexit. Um … but now it’s … for people who feel threatened by president elect, Trump’s his name … Um so it was, it was to show, yeah, solidarity with the people like we show your fear and we want to help you get through it,” the police report quotes Bass as saying.

The charge of falsely reporting a misdemeanor carries with it up to 93 days in jail, a $500 fine or both, according to the Michigan Daily. Because of her depressed state at the time, Bass’s lawyers are requesting she be sentenced in mental health court.

Oddly enough, Bass isn’t the only Michigan student to make up a hate crime after Trump’s election.

A Muslim student at the university garnered national attention after claiming a man forced her to remove her hijab and threatened to light her on fire. That hate crime, too, turned out to be a hoax. (RELATED: Anti-Muslim Threat At University Of Michigan Was A Huge Hoax)

Unlike Bass, the Muslim woman did not face charges for filing a false police report.

"Republican lawmaker decides Indiana will remain without hate crime law Copyright by WISH - All rights reserved State Sen. Susan Glick (left), a Republican from LaGrange, said Jan. 30, 2018, that one of the sticking points lawmakers could not agree on in a proposed Indiana hate crime measure was gender identity. (WISH Photo) [ + - ] Video

INDIANAPOLIS (WISH)- A stunning upset Tuesday for supporters of hate crime legislation in Indiana.

The final hate crime bill alive in the Senate died Tuesday morning in a committee chairmans decision that shocked some supporters.

After years of trying, lawmakers announced they could not agree on a bias or hate crimes bill. State Senate Pro Temp David Long, a Republican from Fort Wayne, said, Some dont agree on the methodology utilized or the language or whatever, but, were much closer, I think, than people realize to getting something done. I personally support moving forward with the idea.

The bill itself died because Republican State Sen. Susan Glick, from LaGrange, said some lawmakers believed the bill did not go far enough, while she said others thought the current law just needs a little nudge.

Glick said one of the sticking points lawmakers could not agree on was gender identity.

Glick said, I think the list of characteristics was all-encompassing. I really believe people read that list and see in parens, in their minds, it only applies to this race or this religion or these people. In fact, all of us have a a gender identity. All of us have a sexual identity.

Long said crime victims are already covered under current law.

We do have a way to enhance a sentence for someone who has committed a crime against someone, for whatever bias they hold, he said.

But, that just isnt clear enough, said Glick, who partly authored the hate crimes bill.

Glick said, When it comes to hate, when it comes to bias, I think its very important that we protect all of our citizens. I wanted to bring that home by additional legislation and additional protections.

Byron Ratcliff, the state criminal justice chair of the Indianapolis NAACP, said, Its a shame. They ought to be ashamed.

He added, I didnt believe it was going to happen, but it did.

Ratcliff said, Only five states in the Union dont have a bias or hate crimes bill. Why is Indiana one of them?

Glick said times, attitudes and people are changing ... maybe not fast enough.

I believe our ability to reach a compromise on this language in the future may come sooner rather than later, she said. But, I think were not there yet.

Why cant lawmakers perhaps model an Indiana bill after one of the other 45 states with similar laws on the books. Long and Glick said other states rules were all over the map, and arent as helpful as they initially thought.

Democrat State Sen. Greg Taylor, from Indianapolis, said also had a bias crimes bill going, but that bill is now dead, too, his rep said.

About the committees decision, Taylor said in a statement:

I am more than disappointed and angry on behalf of victims in this state that another year has gone by and the General Assembly has chosen not to put a law on the books to protect those who are affected by bias motivated crimes. A bias crimes bill was part of the Indiana Senate Democrats legislative agenda and our efforts to get this bill passed will not be stopped because of the inaction of one committee. I was told on the Senate floor last year that a bipartisan effort would be made to ensure a bias crimes law would be passed this legislative session. Those conversations ended when session began. The courageous families who came to the Statehouse to tell the stories of the crimes that have been committed against their loved ones because of a bias, were ignored when the chairman of the committee failed to hear this bill today.

About the committees decision, Marion County Prosecutor Terry Curry said:

I am exceedingly disappointed that the legislature has again failed to act on a hate crimes bill. Curry went on to say Hate motivated crimes will continue to occur in our state. How we collectively identify and address those crimes should be clear and direct. We will not tolerate the targeting of fellow individuals due to their race, religion, sexual orientation, or other characteristic.

State Rep. Cherrish Pryor, a Democrat from Indianapolis who chairs the Indiana Black Legislative Caucus, said, Today, the people of Indiana were let down.

She added, The Senate has made it clear that it does not matter if a person is harmed because their attackers were upset that they had a different race, color, creed, disability, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender or gender identity. They will not get the justice they deserve because some in the Senate cannot face their responsibility to protect all Hoosiers. They prefer to delay and put off decisions until another day.

In a statement Tuesday, Long explained the decision.

Our caucus discussed the bias crimes bill for several days in an attempt to come to a consensus on language that would effectively punish those who commit crimes against their victim because of who that person is.

Long added, In the end, we were unable to come to a consensus on how to approach this issue. Some members felt that making a list in Indiana code would inevitably leave someone off, some felt the bill was fine as it was, and some felt that Indiana code already allows the aggravator concept to apply in a bias-crime situation, which is true.

A quick search on the states General Assembly website Tuesday evening did not show any other bias crime bills in the House or Senate.",1

"Screengrabs via YouTube / Count Dankula

Buddha was a cute, innocent pug like any other until Mark Meechan—a professional shitposter who prides himself on being anti-PC as Count Dankula online—decided to teach him a new trick. He claimed to have trained the dog to throw up a Nazi salute every time it heard Sieg Heil and uploaded footage of the corrupted pup to YouTube—a stunt that landed him in court on Tuesday.

Meechan was convicted on hate crime charges in a Scottish court for uploading the video, which the presiding judge called grossly offensive, the Telegraph reports. Despite Meechans insistence that the clip was a joke—and that his right to free speech was under assault—the judge ruled the footage was anti-Semitic and racist in nature, finding him guilty of violating the UKs Communications Act of 2003. He now could face up to six months in prison.

In the clip—tastefully titled M8 Yer Dugs A Nazi and viewed more than 3 million times—Meechan explains that he wanted to play a prank on his girlfriend, who adored her pug, by turning him into the least cute thing I could think of. In that baby voice everyone puts on when they talk to dogs for some reason, Meechan goads Buddha into getting excited about the Holocaust.

Buddha, do you want to gas the Jews? he asks. Cmon, gas the Jews!

About as casually as you might say here boy, he spits out the phrase dozens of times, until Buddha starts to perk up every time he hears it. After he sticks the pooch in front of a TV and shows him a Hitler rally from the 30s, he plops him on the floor and starts calling Sieg Heil, prompting the mutt to raise his stubby paw in a Nazi salute.

Screengrab via YouTube

Meechan has since apologized for the video and insisted that he he didnt mean to offend anyone. As he tells it, shouting gas the Jews over and over again and posting footage of it online was just supposed to be funny.

I actually hate racism in any way, shape, or form, Meechan said in his apology video. It was done as a joke, as a dank meme, and purely just to annoy my girlfriend.

Meanwhile, hes been leaning into the whole anti-PC warrior thing, buddying up with the likes of Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson while he live-blogs his own court appearance on Twitter. Hes scheduled for sentencing on April 23, but judging from his tweets, hes been taking the whole going to jail for turning a dog into a Nazi thing pretty well—or at least pretending to.

"White supremacist terror is at the top of people’s minds after a white supremacist stabbed and killed two men who were defending two young black women, one in a hijab, from his bigoted rant in Portland, Oregon, last month.

The incident attracted widespread media coverage, which in turn drew criticism from many people on Twitter who denounced news outlets for not labeling the attack as terrorism.

There’s a familiar double standard in how the media treats violence by white supremacists versus violence by Islamist extremists. It’s time to get it right.

HuffPost spoke to two experts ― Farai Chideya, a journalist who has been reporting on white nationalism for more than 25 years, and Heidi Beirich, the head of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project, who has been studying white extremist groups since 1999 ― to discuss the problem of white supremacist hate today, and how the media can do a better job covering it.

Portland Police Bureau/Handout via REUTERS Jeremy Christian, 35, stabbed three people and killed two of them after they came to the defense of two teens in Portland, Oregon.

This is what the media should know:

1. White supremacist hate is not rare.

“The one thing that bothers me the most about media coverage of these incidents is that they’re not frequently enough put in the context of the fact we’ve had ton of domestic terrorism recently,” Beirich told HuffPost.

Beirich noted a recent spate of white supremacist attacks in the U.S. In addition to the May 26 Portland attack, there’s the March 20 murder of 66-year-old Timothy Caughman, who was black, by a man who traveled to New York City expressly to kill African-American men, and the May 22 killing of Richard Collins III, a black college student in Maryland, by a man who belonged to a white supremacist Facebook group.

“When it comes to Muslim terrorism, nobody questions it’s a problem that’s an ongoing threat ― a security problem, radicalization problem, et cetera ― which it is,” Beirich said. “But when it comes to Portland or Dylann Roof [the 2015 Charleston church shooter], they always seem to appear as one-offs.”

Outlets covering last week’s truck and knife attack in London, for instance ― carried out by three men identified as Islamist extremists ― often made a point of mentioning the bombing in Manchester, England, two weeks before.

But many news outlets covering the stabbing attack in Portland failed to mention other recent U.S. attacks by white supremacists, such as the one in Maryland just a few days earlier.

Meanwhile, more domestic terrorism incidents in the U.S. have been carried out by people associated with white supremacist ideologies than by people with radical Islamist ideologies, Beirich noted.

In tracking deadly terror attacks in the U.S., the New America Foundation has counted 11 attacks by Islamic extremists since 9/11, compared to 21 by far-right extremists. Between the 9/11 attacks and the 2016 Orlando, Florida, nightclub shooting, more people were killed in the U.S. by right-wing extremists than by Islamic extremists, the foundation said.

We began as a country that said ‘all men are created equal’ ― but there was slavery, and women were not allowed to vote. Farai Chideya

Americans “shouldn’t be surprised” by the frequency of white supremacist attacks, since they are rooted in a long history of racial discrimination, Beirich said. As she puts it, until the Voting Rights Act of 1965, “white supremacy was the law of the land.”

“I’m disturbed by this cycle [of attacks],” Chideya told HuffPost. “But we began as a country that said ‘all men are created equal’ ― but there was slavery, and women were not allowed to vote.”

“This is a continuation,” she added. “We’re not done, just because people are uneasy with how long the history is and how prevalent the issue is. We have to give up thinking this is rare.”

2. White supremacist hate is not “fringe.”

White supremacist hate doesn’t just manifest as violent extremism, Chideya noted.

“People frame it as weird guys with fringe beliefs ― no,” Chideya said. “White supremacists don’t just wear hoods and give Nazi salutes. White nationalists are in the U.S. government.”

She pointed to “institutionalized white nationalism, like voting laws,” mentioning North Carolina’s voting practices an example of “de facto white nationalism.” The courts recently found that the state’s legislative districts were drawn to intentionally disadvantage black voters.

Chideya also mentioned “political white nationalism, like in the White House,” calling out the links between the white supremacist movement and upper echelons of the federal government.

She listed President Donald Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon, who led Breitbart News, a publisher of white nationalist content, and Trump aide Sebastian Gorka, who reportedly has ties to a Nazi-aligned group. When Beirich spoke to HuffPost in April, she also pointed to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has received awards from and has spoken at events for an organization that the Southern Poverty Law Center lists as an anti-Muslim hate group.

In terms of how news media could do better, Chideya pointed to coverage of Greg Gianforte, who was elected to Congress in Montana last month and was found to have made donations to candidates with ties to white nationalist groups ― which Rewire reported just days before his election. Gianforte made national news when he physically attacked a reporter on the eve of the election.

Chideya said members of the news media were slow to surface Gianforte’s links to hate groups, which she thought should have “come out sooner.”

“In general, reporters need to become more adept at tracking not just extremist white nationalism, but also when it enters the mainstream, like in Montana,” Chideya said. “The same way you run a background check on politicians’ finances, run a check on if they are connected to extremist ideologies.”

REUTERS/Colter Peterson Greg Gianforte got into hot water for body-slamming a reporter before his election, but what about his donations to proponents of white nationalism?

3. White supremacist hate is terror.

Distressing that this piece I wrote on white supremacist violence in March can be so easily re-upped for Portland. https://t.co/zezC2Ymsko — Sherrilyn Ifill (@Sifill_LDF) May 31, 2017

“What is terrorism? Acts designed to inspire terror. But somehow, we don’t call this terrorism,” Chideya told HuffPost of the Portland attack. “When a Muslim terrorist kills one, two, five people, it’s immediately labeled terrorism. But when a white nationalist kills one, two, five people, it’s not labeled terrorism. But they’re the same.”

“We have to be aware as journalists of the labels we use,” she added.

The issue of how to label any given attack is complex. As CNN reports, for an attack to be labeled a hate crime, a perpetrator has to attack someone based on their identity ― for example, their race, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity. For an act to be labeled terrorism, the perpetrator has to be motivated by political or ideological beliefs.

But the line is blurry. Many people condemned the government for not labeling Dylann Roof a terrorist after he killed nine black people in a Charleston church in 2015 and specifically said he was there “to shoot black people,” according to witnesses.

There is a more general presumption that white people are good and innocent in American culture at large ― and journalists come from that culture. Farai Chideya

Officials themselves can be slow to use the “terrorist” label when white attackers are involved, adding to the challenge for journalists.

“It’s too early to say whether last night’s violence was an act of domestic terrorism or a federal hate crime,” an FBI special agent told reporters the day after the Portland attack, per CNN.

Beyond the inconsistent labeling, there are other discrepancies in how the media treats violent attacks by white supremacists versus by Islamist extremists.

“Plenty of terrorists have had mental health issues,” Chideya told HuffPost. “There is a more general presumption that white people are good and innocent in American culture at large ― and journalists come from that culture.”

This quote is about the white supremacist who killed two folks in Portland on Friday. How about: he was radicalized? https://t.co/LrJ6rFRQgd pic.twitter.com/AOa8U3Gjzw — Jamil Smith (@JamilSmith) May 27, 2017

The presumption that the attacker is mentally ill and not radicalized is strictly based on religion and race, btw. https://t.co/onKJtOAog1 — Joy Reid (@JoyAnnReid) May 27, 2017

And when someone perceived as Muslim commits an attack, the news typically receives far more coverage than an attack by a white supremacist would.

This double standard is perpetuated from the nation’s highest office, as Trump continues to respond selectively to terror attacks during his presidency.

After Islamist extremists attacked London, for instance, he condemned the violence on Twitter the same day. After the Portland attack, Trump waited more than two days before tweeting about it.

It is my favorite pattern of this presidency. If Trump thinks an attacker is Muslim, instant condemnation. If not, prolonged silence. — Jamelle Bouie (@jbouie) June 4, 2017

“There’s crickets from Donald Trump when there’s white nationalist violence,” Chideya said. “But there’s a deluge with Muslim violence.”

4. White supremacist hate needs more ― not less ― coverage.

News organizations are sometimes concerned about giving extremists too much attention, which could feed into their desire for publicity and spur copycats.

Beirich recognizes the issue, but she maintains that reporters need to pay more attention ― not less ― to the issue of white supremacist hate.

“I know there are concerns about journalists who don’t want to report on a neo-Nazi rally where four people show up, because those groups are just seeking attention ― and that’s a valid point,” Beirich said. “But when we’re talking about domestic terrorism and hate crimes related to white supremacy ― that’s a real thing.”

“I understand not wanting to draw attention to small instances,” she added, noting specifically the series of news stories about white supremacist flyers on college campuses. “But when people are getting killed because of this, we’ve got to pay attention.”

When people are getting killed because of this, weve got to pay attention. Heidi Beirich

Deciding how much of a platform to provide extremists is an “inevitable transaction of journalism,” Chideya noted.

She recalled a time years ago when she was conducting a phone interview with a woman in the white supremacist movement. At the end of the interview, Chideya asked: “I’m black ― would you have granted me the interview if you’d known that?”

The woman responded: “Probably not ― but on the other hand, every time I talk to a reporter, people will read your article and come find me.”

“You can write a piece saying [white supremacists] are cowards, and there still will be people who come over to their side,” Chideya told HuffPost. “That doesn’t mean you don’t do journalism ― you just do it as well as you can.”

Good reporting on white supremacist movements will recognize that there is a range of people within any movement.

“It’s a question of journalism: Not every story is about Derek Black,” she said, referring to a man The Washington Post profiled after he left the so-called alt-right movement. “Nor about the worst violent person in the movement.”

5. White supremacist hate is a bigger problem than you think.

“Not only do we have domestic terrorism inspired by racism, but also we have a hate crime problem ― and the dimensions are not understood,” Beirich said.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation, for instance, puts out a report of around 5,000 to 6,000 hate crimes each year. But when the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics did a large-scale study from 2007 to 2011, Beirich noted, it found the number of hate crimes closer to 260,000 per year.

If people were looking at these data points more, we would be talking about ways to combat this problem. Heidi Beirich

“If people were looking at these data points more, we would be talking about ways to combat this problem,” Beirich said. “This leads to less public policy interest in domestic terrorism committed by white supremacists ― and allows Trump to minimize these threats. We should not leave him off the hook.”

After Saturday’s attack by Islamist extremists in London, British Prime Minister Theresa May called for a new strategy on terror. Trump called on the courts to reinstate his travel ban on certain Muslim-majority countries ― a move that was roundly criticized.

By contrast, after the Portland attack, Trump made no calls to change policy to prevent future attacks.

“The facts and the context have to be put out there by media,” Beirich said. “We need policies to address this.”",1

"OAKLAND, CA – An 18-year-old Oakland teen was charged with involuntary manslaughter today for fatally shooting another teen in an apparent accident at the 18-year-olds residence near Lake Merritt on Wednesday morning. Marco Palma-Cruz was also charged with felony discharging a firearm with gross negligence for allegedly shooting 17-year-old Luis Urquidez inside his residence in the 800 block of East 18th Street at about 7:14 a.m. on Wednesday. Oakland police Officer Jose Barocio wrote in a probable cause statement that officers who responded to the shooting found Urquidez suffering from a single shot in his upper torso. Urquidez was transported to nearby Highland Hospital but was pronounced dead about three hours later, police said. A witness told police that Palma-Cruz had been playing with a firearm and had shot Urquidez, Barocio said. When police interviewed Palma-Cruz he admitted to playing with a firearm and said he accidentally fired a round toward Urquidez, according to Barocio. Another witness admitted that he had removed the firearm from inside the residence and hid it from law enforcement but told officers that he would take them to the firearm so that they could recover it, Barocio wrote. Palma-Cruz was arraigned at the Wiley Manuel Courthouse in Oakland today and is being held at the Santa Rita Jail in Dublin. On Tuesday, a 42-year-old man was found murdered in the same vicinity.

"The National Association for the Advancement of Colored Peoples Camden County East branch is investigating a possible hate crime after two notes containing racial slur were found inside the locker of a black student at a Christian school in New Jersey.

(REUTERS / Aly Song) A student uses his locker at the Oxford International College in Changzhou, Jiangsu province January 10, 2013.

NAACP chapter president Lloyd D. Henderson said they received a complaint from the mother of a black student at the Gloucester County Christian School after her son found a second note with racial slur in his locker on Oct. 18, after he got the first one in the same way on Oct. 13. The note read, I hope you die n---, The Philadelphia Inquirer detailed.

Sharon Jackson, the mother, said her child and his sibling have since transferred to a public school in a nearby county. She admitted that the racist notes came as a surprise because they thought that the Christian school was the perfect environment for their kids.

In response to the incident, campus administrator Pastor John Mark Turner delivered a sermon to students on how to treat each other based on what the Bible teaches. He said the issue will also be incorporated in their American history classes.

We do care about all of our students, and I mean that sincerely, said Pastor Turner. We want students who come here to be welcomed and not to feel out of place.

In addition, Turner said school officials were now investigating the incident and were trying to identify the person responsible for the racist notes. He added that the culprit could either be suspended or kicked out of the school.

Last month, a violently racist rap track made its rounds among the students at the Spanish Fort High School in Alabama. The song, which was recorded at the school, contained lyrics threatening violence towards black people, LGBT individuals, Muslims, and other minorities, BuzzFeed reported.

School superintendent Eddie Tyler denounced the rap as vile and disgusting. He also said at the time that the administrators were discussing the rightful sanctions against the student who recorded the racist track.",1

NEW YORK — Hoping to get an accurate count of anti-Muslim hate crimes in the United States, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, launched a mobile app Friday allowing victims to report bias incidents.

The group launched its Making Democracy Work for Everyone app a month after it reported a 44 percent surge in the number of hate crimes reported by U.S. Muslims last year. Concerned that the 260 hate crimes CAIR learned of last year represent just a fraction of the actual total, the group intends the app to increase reporting.

“In a moment of trauma, you’re not thinking that I need to go online and enter something, but your phone will always be in your hand,” Corey Saylor, who runs the group’s anti-Islamophobia efforts, said.

The application allows a user to file a description of an alleged incident, which CAIR staff will then investigate. If the group concludes the incident was the result religious bias, it will include it in its reporting, and if it believes the incident was criminal, it will share the details with local police.

The app offers advice about what rights are protected by the U.S. Constitution and contains contact information for CAIR’s national headquarters in Washington and chapters nationwide.

The group this year resumed tracking anti-Muslim incidents, following a surge in bias cases last year. While the group saw an increase in anti-Muslim incidents prior to Donald Trump’s stunning rise in last year’s presidential primaries and November election victory, it said the acceleration in bias incidents was due in part to Trump’s focus on militant Islamist groups and anti-immigrant rhetoric.

Trump has said his policies do not reflect religious discrimination but rather efforts to improve national security, following a series of attacks.

It is not the first time a U.S. advocacy group has used an app to try to track bias incidents. The Sikh Coalition Organization launched a similar app in 2012 to report bias incidents in U.S. airports.",1

"Several states, including Washington, Mississippi, New York, Louisiana and Kentucky, have or are considering putting police officers as a protected class in hate crime legislation. Hate crime legislation is now under consideration on the federal level. The Protect and Serve Act of 2018 was introduced by Senators Heidi Heitkamp and Orrin Hatch. The measure aims to make it a federal crime to knowingly cause or attempt injury because of the “actual or perceived status” that the person is a law enforcement officer.

Opponents of hate crime laws in general, and the extension of these laws to protect police officers, assert that the laws conflict with our legal history of punishing only behavior and not thoughts, inhibit free speech and public protest, are political statements with selective enforcement, and are redundant since they seek to punish behavior already unlawful with inherent contempt for any victim. Additionally, the increase in federalizing criminal justice issues may infringe on state’s rights.

It would be hard not to support any sign that lawmakers are supporting police officers, but the net effect of hate crime laws on the lives of police officers is not likely to be significant. Here are some areas where legislation could really make an impact:",1
"UPDATE (Dec. 13, 3:35 p.m.): A Woodbridge resident has been charged with setting a tow truck on fire in Mount Vernon Wednesday.

"A gay man in Manchester has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for assault after he ran someone over with his car.

Aaron McDonald, who works for a finance company, and his boyfriend Max Kent were kicked out of a bar in Manchester’s Gay Village one night in March, 2017, for “bad behavior,” according prosecutor Sara Haque.

At around 5 a.m., McDonald, who was drunk and had gotten separated from Kent, heard a man he didn’t know make sexist remarks about a woman.

The man, Muso Dem, called his female friend a “silly stupid slut,” according to court records.

McDonald stopped to tell Dem not to say that, and Dem called him a “faggot boy.”

Surveillance video shows that there was some discussion between McDonald and Dem before Dem punched McDonald and kicked him.

Instead of just walking away, though, McDonald got into his car and aimed it at Dem, who was crossing the street with his friends. Dem hit the windshield, breaking it, and McDonald continued to drive with Dem’s body on the hood of his car.

McDonald also hit one of the women that Dem was with; she was knocked to the side.

McDonald stopped suddenly and Dem rolled off the hood. He was caught on surveillance cameras running Dem over again, dragging him for several feet until the back wheels of his cars went over his body.

He then drove home, drank some more wine, and went to sleep. The next morning, police showed up at his apartment. He allegedly said he knew why they were there.

Dem was left with a fractured pelvis and spine and a broken knee. He was hospitalized for weeks, had multiple surgeries, needs a catheter, and now has metal plates in his knee.

McDonald’s lawyer told the court that he was in a state of “panic,” and that he wasn’t really aware of what he was doing.

The judge, though, didn’t buy it.

“You said to the jury that you panicked and sought sanctuary in your car,” said Judge Michael Leeming at sentencing. “But you did not report this to the police, despite going back to the scene and seeing emergency vehicles attending the victim and pedestrians.”

“You deliberately set off to run him over when you saw him in the road.”

He has also been banned from driving for 11 years.

"Cracking down on hate crimes; thats the goal of a new proposal in University City. On Monday, city leaders will take a final vote that would create a hate crime database.

Alderman Rod Jennings introduced the bill last November. Jennings is in Washington D.C. at the National League of Cities Conference. He’s working to sell his proposed hate crime database to U.S. and local leaders.

Jennings says that University City is known for its diversity and progressiveness. And that it’s more important than ever to create an up-to-date registry.

The idea is that anyone would be able to go online and see the people in the community who have been convicted of having committed a hate crime. If neighboring communities adopt the bill, then they could share the information between and among communities.

Critics say they’re not sure this bill will deter hate crimes from happening.

Jennings says Hate Crime legislation will be at the forefront of what he shares during an Advocacy Day on Capitol Hill.

Im hand-delivering my hate crime bill to my members of congress in Missouri and not only to the one’s in the St. Louis area, and across the state in Kansas city and from the middle of the state. I have access to them and Im going to ask them to strongly consider making a uniform hate crime bill in this country,” he said in a phone interview.

Jennings will be skyping in to Monday’s vote. A minimum of four aldermen need to vote in favor for the bill to pass.

More than 30 members of the Sikh community joined elected officials last Friday in a show of solidarity for taxi driver Harkirat Singh, 25, at the Gurdwara Sikh Temple Society in Richmond Hill where Assemblyman David Weprin (D-Hollis) held a news conference to address the assault on the driver.

Singh recounted what happened to him as he was driving a block away from Penn Station and picked up drunken passengers, three men and a woman, at 5 a.m. on April 16. They asked to be driven to the Bronx.

As he approached the destination, Singh said the four customers hurled slurs at him and became even more belligerent when they realized they had given him the wrong address. Singh requested payment on their $41.76 fare, and that they leave his cab. When they refused to pay, Singh called 911. The driver said the female gave him cash, but one of the men got back into the taxi to pull off his turban and tried to take his phone before they all ran off. Singh, who came to the United States from the Punjab three years ago, managed to get a snapshot of one of the four passengers during the ordeal, Weprin said.

Weprin hopes that the attention generated by this incident will help get his long gestating Religious Garb Bill to the Senate floor.

“I have a bill that was passed four years in a row in the Assembly and it has not passed the Senate yet,” Weprin said. “It would outlaw discrimination in any employment in New York state, public or private, for people wearing religious garbs, such as turbans or people wearing facial hair,” Weprin said. “With hate crimes rising in 2017, it is more important than ever that we stand together with our fellow Americans of faith.

Weprin called the theft of Singh’s turban a hate crime and believes that, even though the taxi driver was not seriously harmed, “the police should investigate it as such.”

Joining the assemblyman was Queens Borough President Melinda Katz, Council member Barry Gordenchik, Franck Joseph II of the Commission on Human Right, new Sikh Society President Kudip Singh Dhillon and Councilman Rory Lancman. (D-Hillcrest).

“It is a courageous thing to come forward and speak,” Katz told Singh, who lives in Ozone Park. “It is not easy to have your faith insulted and go through a robbery like you did. Messages of hate will not be tolerated in the city of New York, especially in Queens.”

Singh later thanked the NYPD for putting all their efforts into the investigation and for responding within the five minutes of his 911 phone call during the attack.

The investigation is currently being conducted by officers at One Police Plaza.

"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Indiana will remain one of just five states without a hate crimes law after key lawmakers in the GOP-dominated Senate announced Tuesday that they were abandoning a bill targeting crimes motivated by bias.



Leaders of Indiana’s GOP-dominated Statehouse have consistently opposed hate crimes legislation. But that changed this year in the wake of clashes between white supremacists and counter-demonstrators in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left one woman dead in August.

The bill by Republican Sen. Sue Glick had support from GOP leaders, including House Speaker Brian Bosma and Senate leader David Long. Then on Tuesday, the chairman of a key Senate committee decided to not take a vote on the bill.

“It’s a matter of peoples’ opinions. We just couldn’t come to consensus,” Long, of Fort Wayne, said late at a press conference announcing the effort was done for the year.

A deep thread of social conservatism runs throughout the state and lawmakers, headed into an election year, faced intense pressure from activists who argue that creating a hate crimes law would create a special protected class of victims.

At the same time, much of Indiana’s business community was in lock-step support of the measure, which they say is important to lure talent and new business to the state.

Indianapolis was named one of 20 finalists competing to be the location of a second Amazon headquarters. A coalition of central Indiana municipal officials, including Republicans, had pushed for a hate crimes law in hopes of making the state more appealing.

Despite his support for the measure, Long dismissed their worries.

“I really don’t think it should affect anything,” said Long. “Nor do I think we should tailor all of our legislation in hopes that a company would locate here. I would hope they’d be coming to Indiana because we are a welcoming state, because we have a great economy and we have low cost of living.”

The bill by Glick, a former county prosecutor from LaGrange County, would have specifically allowed a judge to take into account whether a crime was motivated by someone’s race, religion, color, sex, gender identity, disability, national origin, ancestry, sexual orientation or ethnicity. It would also require such crimes to be reported to the FBI. Currently, Indiana law enforcement agencies are not required to do so.

Advocates say anecdotal accounts suggest the number of so-called bias crimes are on the rise and the Southern Poverty Law Center reports 26 active hate groups in the state.

Democratic Sen. Greg Taylor, of Indianapolis, ripped Republicans for being content with the status quo.

“What we did today was say to companies like Amazon ... ‘We don’t need your business, we don’t need your economic development, we don’t need your jobs,’” said Taylor. “We are comfortable with the status quo.”",1

BU News Service

Twenty-five hate crimes were reported in Cambridge last year, according to the Cambridge Police Department’s 2016 Annual Crime Report. It is the largest number recorded in the last decade.

The number of reported hate crimes almost doubled the 15 reported in 2015. According to the CPD report, motivations behind the offenses varied by race (14), religion (five), sexual orientation (four), and ethnicity (two).

And while the numbers have dropped so far this year, police and human rights advocates said they are concerned about the factors that may have led to the trend in a city generally known for its progressive and open-minded residents

Across the United States, hate crimes increased in 2016 with 6,121 incidents reported as opposed to 5,850 reported in 2015, according to the FBI’s 2016 Hate Crime Statistics.

Massachusetts saw a decline in hate crimes, however, from 411 filed in 2015 to 391 in 2016.

Richard Sevieri, the CPD’s strategic analysis coordinator, said the political climate and rise of hate crimes across the country might have triggered the rise of offenses in the city.

“The whole political situation in the country, the election, the amount of protest going on,” Sevieri said in a phone interview. “We had protests four or five different times in the spring and summer of 2016.”

Unlike other police departments, the CPD assigns a staff to “conscientiously capture and classify” hate incidents, which may also be reflected in the 25 incidents recorded in 2016, said Sevieri.

“I wouldn’t say it’s almost a hit or miss, but [other police departments] either don’t have the staff to do it or they don’t classify it,” said Sevieri, who has worked with the CPD for over 30 years.

So far this year, Cambridge has seen fewer hate crimes than last year. Victims have filed 13 reports to the CPD as of Nov. 7, said the strategic analysis coordinator.

Members of the Cambridge Human Rights Commission, created in 1984 to “protect the civil rights of residents and visitors,” according to its website, connect the rise in recorded incidents with the growing awareness of reporting resources.

“I think, after the most recent election, there was more publicity around phone numbers where people could call to report hate crimes,” said Chanta Bhan, the HRC’s chairperson, on Nov. 2 at the commission’s monthly meeting. “There’s increased awareness and increased publicity around reporting mechanisms that make it easier to report.”

Underreporting remains a problem

Despite encouragement for hate crime victims to come forward, 54 percent of hate crimes in the country go unreported, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.

The Anti-Defamation League’s New England regional director, Robert E. Trestan, said he agreed underreporting was an issue. Victims’ fears of identifying themselves and poor law enforcement practices sometimes result in hate incidents going unregistered, he said.

“One of things that we know about hate crimes is that victim impact is much more severe than regular crimes because people are being attacked because of who they are, their skin color, who they love, or what they believe,” Trestan said in a phone interview. “It’s not just an opportunity crime where someone just wants to steal your watch.”

Law enforcement officials should be trained in treating hate crimes as a priority and filing them as biased incidents instead of vandalism so victims feel comfortable coming forward, the ADL’s regional director added.

Potential Hate Crime Prevention Practices

Human Rights Commission members said that communication is crucial to hate crime prevention efforts.

Sabrina Selk, a member of the HRC, said the letters Cambridge Rindge and Latin School faculty sent parents last December after swastikas were drawn in three boys bathrooms demonstrate effective ways to communicate and educate communities on hate crimes.

“I thought it was really great that they didn’t just keep it focused on the high school, but really reached out to the entire public school community to address it and open up conversations,” Selk said. “I think it’s really important to give people a space to talk about these things and issues, and how it affects them directly and indirectly.”

The state took hate crime prevention efforts into its own hands Nov. 6, when Gov. Charlie Baker signed an executive order re-establishing the Governor’s Task Force on Hate Crimes.

The Task Force, initiated by Gov. William Weld in 1991, will meet at least quarterly each year to advise the Governor on the best practices for lowering hate crimes and supporting victims in the state.",1

"AG investigating after biracial boy suffers injuries to neck; family concerned he was targeted

Claremont police and the Attorney Generals Office confirmed that they are investigating after an 8-year-old biracial boy suffered injuries to his neck.

His family said a rope caused the injuries and are concerned that he was targeted.

The incident happened Aug. 28 on private property off North Street, and the boy was treated at a local hospital.

Police said the investigation focuses on other juveniles who are 14 years old or younger and because of state law, few details can be released.



I want to assure everyone in our community, our neighboring communities, and the nation at large that we take all reports made to this agency very seriously, and will complete our investigations in a thorough and professional manner, Claremont Police Chief Mark Chase said.

A rally against racism drew a large crowd in Claremont Tuesday night in response to the alleged incident.

“Having heard the story about the boy, oh my gosh, it’s just so horrible,” said Monica Colby, of Lebanon.

“It definitely warms my heart to know that people care,” said Lorrie Slattery, the boy’s grandmother.

Slattery said it’s been a difficult few weeks.

“Its been an emotional roller coaster, up and down. Its been sadness, anger, all those emotions are flying around,” Slattery said.

Gov. Chris Sununu released a statement saying that the AG’s office sent a team to Claremont to assist in the investigation at his instruction.

“Yesterday on my instruction, the Attorney General’s office sent a team to Claremont to provide assistance, Sununu said. It is my expectation that local and state authorities will investigate appropriately and I’ve asked for regular updates on how things are proceeding. Hatred and bigotry will not be tolerated in New Hampshire.”



“Racism and hate are not a thing of the past. Ive seen it in my job. Ive seen it in the reports that Ive read,” Chase said.

Because everyone involved is a child, police can release few details.

The Attorney General’s Office said that to the extent that there is any credible information that this incident constituted a hate crime or a civil rights violation, the office is prepared to take any and all appropriate action.

“Black lives should matter before we are buried, and this is a perfect example,” said Olivia LaPierre, Racial Justice community organizer. “We need to invest in black people.”

The Attorney Generals Office announced Tuesday that the New Hampshire Department of Justice would be reviewing the incident to determine whether there is credible information that the incident constituted a hate crime or civil rights violation under New Hampshire law.

"MINNEAPOLIS, MN — Customers of Barbette, Bryant Lake Bowl, Pats Tap, Red Stag Supperclub, Tiny Diner and The Bird should expect to see a three percent service charge on their checks beginning on July 28. The eateries are part of Kim Bartmanns restaurant ecosystem, which has provided insurance coverage to staff members since 1993. All employees who work 25 hours a week can choose from four different tiers of health plans, and dental coverage. Staff pays 50 percent of the premium and the remainder is covered by the restaurant, according to the company. Weve all seen the articles about how tough it is to work in restaurants. Having health insurance is critical, even for young people who think that theyre invincible, Bartmann said in a statement. (For more local news, click here to sign up for real-time news alerts and newsletters from Minnesota Patch, click here to find your local Minnesota Patch. Also, follow us on Facebook, and if you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app.) I have worked for Kim for 13 years. I happily chose serving as my career and it wouldnt have been possible if I hadnt been offered health insurance from my employer, says Jeri Casler, a server at Bryant Lake Bowl and Barbette. Bartmann said health insurance has been going up 20 percent to 30 percent a year for the last few years, and they cant continue to sustain those increases. Rather than just raising prices, we want to be transparent about our costs, she said. We think our customers will appreciate knowing that our workers have good quality, affordable health insurance. For Bartmann, providing health insurance to staff is an important part of her overarching vision of sustainability. All of our sustainability efforts -- solar panels, LEED certifications, composting, supporting local organic farms and permaculture, low-waste events -- are ultimately about human health, just like health coverage, notes Bartmann. Im committed to offering quality health insurance to our employees, whatever it takes. Bartmann sees a shifting landscape ahead for restaurants and customers, and service charges will be a part of it. We want to continue to take care of our staff and provide great food and experiences to our guests, notes Bartmann. To do that and be successful, I think well all have to get used to service charges.

"The shooting on Wednesday night led news bulletins in India and triggered outrage on social media, where people voiced concern that President Donald Trumps America First position on immigration and jobs has fueled a climate of intolerance.

White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Friday that any loss of life was tragic, but that it would be absurd to link the killing to Trumps rhetoric.

Navy veteran Adam Purinton, who is white, was charged on Thursday in Johnson County, Kan., with one count of premeditated first-degree murder and two counts of attempted premeditated first-degree murder, District Attorney Stephen Howe told reporters.

He declined to elaborate on the details of the incident or the motive for the shooting.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation was looking at whether it was a hate crime, the official term for crimes motivated by bias or prejudice. A FBI spokeswoman said agents and police canvassed the area on Thursday and the investigation continued on Friday.

Purinton is accused of killing Srinivas Kuchibhotla, 32, and wounding Alok Madasani, also 32, in Austins Bar and Grill in Olathe, Kan., on Wednesday evening, police said.

At least one bystander told the Kansas City Star the gunman shouted get out of my country before shooting the Indian victims.

Purinton is also accused of wounding American Ian Grillot, 24, who was shot as he tried to intervene.

People call me a hero, Grillot said in a video released by the hospital where he was undergoing treatment for gunshot wounds to the hand and chest. I was just doing what anyone should have done for any other human being.

The suspect fled on foot and was arrested without incident five hours later at an Applebees restaurant in Clinton, Mo. He reportedly told an employee there he needed a place to hide because he had killed two Middle Eastern men, the Star reported.

Purinton, a former Federal Aviation Administration employee, was transferred back to Kansas on Friday and was being held at the Johnson County jail with bond set at $2 million, according to jail records.

He is scheduled to appear in court on Monday. It was not immediately known whether he had hired a lawyer.

Police did not say whether Purinton has faced charges in the past. However, he was not generally known to police in Olathe, a city of 134,000 people about 25 miles southwest of Kansas City, Sgt. Logan Bonney said by phone on Friday.

Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback, a Republican, condemned the killing. This sort of senseless violence is never acceptable, he said in a statement.

Be angry!

At Kuchibhotlas family home near the Indian tech hub of Hyderabad, relatives backed government calls to ensure the safety of Indians living in the United States.

The government should voice out this strongly because our brothers, sisters and our relatives are there, the victims brother, Venu Madhav, told Reuters Television outside their home.

Through a window, relatives could be seen sitting quietly, one woman wiping away tears.

Many Indians initially welcomed Trumps election, seeing his calls to restrict Muslim immigration as support for their Hindu-majority country. The nation has been at odds for decades with Pakistan, its mainly Muslim neighbor.

But the Trump administration may also have skilled Indian workers like Kuchibhotla in mind as it considers curbing the H-1B visa program, worrying both Indias $150 billion IT services industry and Prime Minister Narendra Modis government.

Dont be shocked! Be angry! Siddharth, a well-known South Indian actor who uses one name, tweeted to his 2.6 million followers in remarks echoed across social media. Trump is spreading hate. This is a hate crime! RIP #SrinivasKuchibhotla.

"Inquiry into Claremont hate crime allegation complete, findings yet to be released

By KEVIN LANDRIGAN and MARK HAYWARD

New Hampshire Union Leader

Hatred and bigotry will not be tolerated in New Hampshire, Gov. Chris Sununu said in a statement after dispatching state investigators to help Claremont police investigating the alleged assault. (Facebook)

CONCORD — State prosecutors confirmed late last week that they have completed their investigation into the alleged assault eight months ago of an 8-year-old boy in Claremont, who family members say was the target of racial slurs.The results remain confidential, however, because the alleged aggressors were juveniles, according to Claremont police and state officials.The boy’s grandmother told authorities her biracial grandson suffered rope burns Aug. 28 around his neck after a group of teens started calling the boy racial epithets, threw sticks and rocks at his legs.The bullying juveniles then put a rope from an old tire swing around the boy’s neck and pushed him off a picnic table so that he swung back and forth on the rope until he could remove it from around his neck, the grandmother said.The victim was airlifted to Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon for treatment of his injuries.Claremont police said the juveniles under investigation ranged in age, with the youngest only 8.The incident attracted national media attention and some civil rights leaders condemned the local police response.In the wake of that criticism, Attorney General Gordon J. MacDonald announced his office would look into the matter.On Friday, Senior Assistant Attorney General Lisa Wolford announced that phase is now over.“Yes, our investigation into the Claremont incident involving an 8-year-old child has been completed,” she said.Asked when the results would be made public, Wolford replied, “We intend to be fully transparent and will issue a public report as soon as the law permits.”Two weeks after the incident, Gov. Chris Sununu vowed to stay on top of the probe.“It is my expectation that local and state authorities will investigate appropriately and I’ve asked for regular updates on how things are proceeding,” he said at the time.John Formella, Sununu’s legal counsel, said MacDonald’s office will be forthcoming at the appropriate time.“The Attorney General has committed to releasing more information about this case when he is legally able to do so,” Formella said in a statement Friday night.Asked about the number and timing of updates Sununu received and whether documents about them were available under the Right to Know Law (RSA 91-A), Formella said, “Regarding your 91-A request: Our office has no documents that are responsive to your request.”Relatives of the victim claim racial bias played a role in the attack and that a white, teenager was the instigator.The parents of the accused boy told Newsweek that it was not a racially-motivated crime but a tragic accident, and that their family had since been subjected to violent threats against them.klandrigan@unionleader.commhayward@unionleader.com",1
"The man suspected of killing a 17-year-old Muslim girl with a baseball bat as she walked back to her Virginia mosque after breaking her Ramadan fast is due to appear in court on Friday.

Darwin Martinez Torres, 22, is accused of killing Nabra Hassanen near the All Dules Area Muslim Society (ADAMS) mosque in Sterling, Virginia. The June 18 incident allegedly occurred after Torres got into an altercation with a group of teenagers walking to the mosque after breaking their fast at a nearby McDonald’s.

Members of Hassanen’s family have said they believe she was targeted because she was Muslim, but police have maintained there is no evidence the attack was a hate crime.

Torres is scheduled for a preliminary hearing in Fairfax County Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court, the AP reported. He has been charged with second-degree murder.

Fairfax County Police Department

Police have said the incident appeared to be a road rage crime that followed Torres encountering Hassanen and her group at around 3:40 a.m.

Some members of the group were in the road and at least one was riding a bicycle, and Torres—who was driving a red Pontiac—allegedly got into a dispute with a boy on a bicycle. Torres then chased the group into a parking lot, where he got out of his car with a baseball bat and struck Hassanen, according to police.

Torres then loaded Hassanen into his car and took her into nearby Loudoun County, where he allegedly assaulted her again, killed her and dumped her body in a pond close to the apartment building where he lived, according to a recently unsealed search warrant reported by The Washington Post.

Torres, a construction worker, then returned to the scene and was spotted by one of the teenagers who had been in the group with Hassanen. When a police officer asked him to get out of his car, Torres was not wearing shoes or a shirt, and blood was found on the passenger door and back seat, according to the warrant.

Torres admitted his role in killing Hassanen and took police to her body, according to the warrant.

Vigils were held in the wake of Hassanens death, and some called for a hate crime investigation. Hassanen’s father, Mohmoud Hassanen, told The Guardian in June that he believed that she was targeted for being Muslim. “He followed the girls, and all of them had head cloths, meaning they are Muslim, and he had a baseball stick.”

He added: “I told the detective: ‘I want to ask him one question. Why did he do that? Because he doesn’t like Muslims, or what?’ He tells me he has no answer for that. This answer is going to be in the court.”

The victim’s mother, Sawsan Gazzar, told the Post that her daughter had been wearing an abaya—a loose-fitting, dress-like garment that covers the entire body except the head, hands and feet—at the time and may have tripped on the garment when running from the attacker.

“I think it had to do with the way she was dressed and the fact she’s Muslim,” said Gazzar.

Police have said Torres did not appear to have made any racial slurs toward the group. “There is nothing at this point to indicate that this tragic case was a hate crime.... Nothing indicates it was motivated by race or religion,” said a Fairfax County police spokeswoman, Julie Parker, in June.",1

"E.R. Shipps commentary, Dont let hate consume our country (May 30), contained a great irony. While mentioning the the victims of two disgusting racially motivated murders, she shows her own animus and takes the opportunity to take a shot at President Donald Trump.

Ms. Shipp calls out President Trump for his failure to mention the stabbing victims as part of the Memorial Day ceremonies. However, Memorial Day is a day to honor those who died while fighting for their country. Clearly, the stabbing victims were not fighting for the country and were not in uniform. While their stories are tragic, they are not Memorial Day heroes. The author goes on to say that she is not surprised by the presidents failure to mention them and further links him to the ratcheting up of blatant acts of hate.

President Trump did nothing wrong. Ms. Shipps brand of soft hate speech, which includes implications that Mr. Trump may have racist tendencies, only polarizes people and energizes those who commit heinous, racially-motivated crimes. Will hate consume us? If people are so blinded by their own prejudices that they see a nefarious racial motive when Mr. Trump acted appropriately on Memorial Day, then hate may well consume us. If we believe the worst about people and continually look for it, then thats all we will ever see.

"Two men were sentenced for their roles in a conspiracy to rob a drug stash house of multiple kilograms of cocaine they thought would be stored there, U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman said. Robert Smith, a/k/a Born, 43, of Trenton, Mercer County, and Derrick Adams, a/k/a Little D, 30, of Florence and Willingboro, Burlington County, were sentenced to 30 years and 10 years in prison, respectively. Smith was previously convicted of conspiracy to commit robbery, conspiracy to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine, possessing a firearm in connection with a crime of violence and a drug trafficking crime, and possessing a firearm as a previously-convicted felon. Adams previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit robbery and conspiracy to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine. They are each also subject to five years of supervised release. Smith and Adams were part of a conspiracy involving four other people to rob a drug stash house in Maple Shade, Burlington County, in January of 2014, according to documents filed in the case and evidence presented at trial. Text messages showed that Smith and Adams planned to rob the drug stash house while posing as police. Smith was recorded saying he was willing to kill the people in the house if necessary. However, the six men were confronted by special agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) unit when they went to rob the drug stash house on the morning of Jan. 30, 2014. After searching the conspirators and their vehicles, the agents recovered five firearms, including a sawed-off shotgun and two stolen handguns. They also recovered numerous rounds of ammunition, a ballistics vest, masks, gloves, and zip ties. Daquon Basnight, 25, Jamiil McFarlane, 24, and Morris Muse, 36, all of Trenton, were previously sentenced in connection with this crime. Sean Forman, 43, of Willingboro, awaits sentencing.",0

"OLATHE, Kan. (CN) – The man accused of shooting three people and killing one in a Kansas bar last year pleaded guilty to one count of first-degree murder and two counts of first-degree attempted murder in a Johnson County courtroom Tuesday.

Adam Purinton, 52, walked into Austin’s Bar and Grill on Feb. 22, 2017, and shot Indian nationals Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani in what investigators called a hate crime. Bystander Ian Grillot was also shot when he tried to confront and chase down Purinton.

Purinton, wearing an orange jail jumpsuit, expressed no emotion as he pleaded guilty to all three counts before Judge Charles Droege. Last November, he pleaded not guilty to the three charges. At times, Purinton’s public defender Michael McCulloh placed his hand on Purinton’s back as he answered questions from the judge.

Prosecutors Will Hurst and Aubrey Sample of the Johnson County District Attorney’s office worked out a plea agreement with Purinton, but details of that agreement were not discussed.

According to court documents, Purinton confronted Kuchibhotla and Madasani, two Garmin engineers, asking if their “status was legal.”

Purinton left the bar after Grillot and another man asked him to leave. However, Purinton returned to the bar with a handgun, according to witness reports.

Madasani said he heard someone yell “He’s back and he’s got a gun.” Purinton shot Madasani in the leg and shot Kuchibhotla three times. Grillot, who chased Purinton, was shot once in the chest.

Purinton was later arrested at an Applebee’s in Clinton, Missouri, after telling a bartender there he needed a place to hide because he had shot two Iranians.

The shooting drew national attention to hate-based crimes last year, even compelling President Donald Trump to mention it in his first speech to a joint session of Congress.

Purinton still faces federal hate crime charges that could potentially carry the death penalty. He faces life in prison for the first-degree murder charge and 12 to 54 years for each count of attempted murder. Although Kansas has the death penalty, there have been no executions in the state since 1965.

Purinton is scheduled to be sentenced on May 4.

"The man arrested for the fatal stabbing of two train passengers who attempted to intervene in an Islamophobic verbal attack was a known white supremacist, according to reports.

Jeremy Christian, 35, is accused of killing army veteran Ricky Best, 53, and Reed College graduate Taliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche, 23, on Friday as they came to the defense of a pair of Muslim passengers on an MAX commuter train, police said.

The women were allegedly being subjected to verbal abuse by Christian, and one was believed to be wearing a hijab — or Muslim veil — police said. The women left the scene of the attack but police have said they have since made contact with them.

A third victim of the attack, Micah David Cole Fletcher, 21, remains in hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries.

Portland mayor Ted Wheeler in a media conference Saturday called the attack “a horrific act of racist violence”.

According to online records, Christian, 35, is being held without bail at the Multnomah County Detention Center without opportunity for bail. Hes facing charges of aggravated murder and attempted murder.

On Saturday, it emerged that Christian had appeared at a Portland ‘alt-right’ rally in April draped in an American Revolutionary War flag, where he yelled racist slurs and gave a Nazi salute, according to the Portland Mercury and Williamette Week.

Police had earlier that day confiscated a baseball bat he was carrying.

On Christian’s Facebook page, he expresses support for far-right causes, and expresses racist and anti-Semitic views.

On 9 May, he claims to have challenged Nuremberg prosecutor Ben Ferencz to a debate, in which “I will defend the Nazis.”

He reposted a meme on April 28 calling for mosques to be destroyed as a response to 9/11, and criticizing the removal of Confederate era statues in southern U.S. states, as well as memes attacking activists who have confronted alt-right protesters at rallies.

Renn Cannon, the special agent in charge of the FBI office in Portland, told reporters Saturday :

“Its too early to say whether last nights violence was an act of domestic terrorism or a federal hate crime.”

Christian is scheduled to appear in court Tuesday.

The attack came on the eve of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

On Sunday, Muslim organizations had raised $189,000 for victims of the stabbing and their families, with almost 5,000 people offering donations.

Southern Poverty Law Center Intelligence Project Director Heidi Beirich told NPR that the attack comes amid a rising number of Islamophobic incidents.

“We have seen since the latter parts of the Obama administration an incredible rise in the frequency of attacks like this, hate crime attacks and domestic terrorism attacks,” said Beirich.

“And the targets of those hate crimes have tended to be those populations demonized by the Trump campaign and now Trump administration.”

In the wake of the attack, the Council on American-Islamic Relations called on President Trump to denounce “rising bigotry” and acts of violence against Muslims.

“President Trump must speak out personally against the rising tide of Islamophobia and other forms of bigotry and racism in our nation that he has provoked through his numerous statements, policies and appointments that have negatively impacted minority communities,” CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad said in a statement.",1
"By Ram Puniyani

The ghastly incident in Rajsamand, Rajasthan, showed the impact which ‘Hate other’ can create. On December 6, Shambhulal Regar, an ex-marble trader hacked to death a Muslim worker Afrazul Khan. Afrazul, a labourer, was called by Shambhu on the pretext of giving him some work. Many immigrants like him from West Bengal have been staying in Rajsamand working on the construction of roads and other sundry occupations. The horrific part of the incident was that Shambhu got his 14-year-old nephew to shoot the incident on video and then to upload the clip. The incident must belong to hate crime of the worst order. Killing with an axe then burning the body and video shooting it!

While Shanbhu has been arrested, the degree of support for such crimes is also becoming visible. One lawyer has offered Rs 50,000 to Shambhu’s family. Countrywide nearly three lakhs have been collected for his family. One Updesh Rana of Hindu Sanatan Sangh, a rightwing group, has been arrested as he had called for a rally in support of Shambhulal Raiger in nearby Udaipur. Police had to disperse the crowds assembling in support of Shambhu. Much more are looking up to Shabbhulal as a hero. This incident reminds one of the deeds done by Dara Singh (Rajendra Singh Pal), an activist belonging to Bajrang Dal, who had burnt Pastor Graham Stains in Orissa. Upholding these acts of killers by large sections who are sympathising with these crimes just goes to show the spread of ‘Hate ideology’, worsening by the day.

PUCL report on the incident says that Shambhulal was “a clone of the RSS hate factory and indulged in the gruesome hate crime.” Frightened by the crime many Bengali immigrants have left for their state. This act seems to be even worse than the killing of Pastor Stains, who was burnt alive by Dara Singh. On that occasion the then President of India K.R. Narayanan said that the “The killings belong to the world’s inventory of black deeds”. Dara Singh was active in Hindu right-wing groups and was eulogized by a section of Hindu communalists; they also fought his case and worked for reducing his death penalty to life imprisonment.

Shambhu has been a marble trader, fairly successful as per accounts. His business got a setback after the demonetization and he started spending more time on ‘whatsapp’ and became active on social media. As per what he said in the video, he was full of hate for Muslims mainly as he perceived that love jihad by Muslim men is luring Hindu women, which he felt is the danger to Hindu community. He shouted the terms Babri Masjid, Padmavati, love jihad on the video and called for revenge against ‘these people’.

Some ideologues are trying to compare this act with the murder of a Hindu boy in Karnataka, who was castrated also. It is true that society is witnessing different hate crimes. While some non-Muslims also suffer, the major victims of these are religious minorities and Dalits. Still the major brunt from last some time is being borne by the Muslim community. The communal violence, the intensity of which has been worsening during last few decades takes place mainly as the divisive ideology has been dominantly increasing in degree during this period and has been going up exponentially during last three years in particular. One does recall the seeds of this ideology do come from the colonial period, the roots of which lie in false perceptions about forcible conversions, jizya tax and temple destructions among others. The misconceptions have been intensified and new grounds have been prepared for adverse propaganda promoting hate.

While the earlier misconceptions have been there, the global terrorism, with roots in politics of oil, has worsened the scenario.

In India from the decade of the 1980s, so-called appeasement of Muslims, personal laws, their illiteracy, poor hygiene, large families have been used in a negative way to paint a dark picture of the community. While Christian demonization is structured around conversion, the Muslim demonization has gone in to add to the issues of the Holy cow, (beef eating and cow slaughter), love jihad, Ghar wapasi to name the few.

What has changed during last few years in the understanding of the likes of Shambhu and killer of Akhlaq, Pehlu, Junaid or floggers of Una, is that they feel empowered due to the utterances from those in power. The subtle message percolated down is that it’s ‘their’ government and they can get away with the heinous crimes. When Central ministers come and put tricolour on the body of accused of the murder of Akhlaq, what message will go down? The honour conferred on the murder accused of Akhlaq is what promotes a Shambhu to come forward and engineer the crime of the nature unheard of in the near past.

Equating this ghastly crime with some other murder in Karnataka is to distract the attention from the basic issue of growing communalisation, the spread and intensity of ‘Hate other ideology’ constructed around emotive issues. While law should be enforced, what about the propaganda, rumours which have been percolated and are being spread through the specially set up media cells employing hundred of youth to spread the divisiveness? What message the potential Shambhu’s get when they know that not only our Prime minister is calculatedly keeping quiet on such crimes, he also is the follower of the peddlers of hate on the Twitter etc.?

The country which had witnessed the coming together of people of all religions through development of interactive vibrant culture all through the history, with contributions from people of all the religions, the country which witnessed people of all religions rubbing shoulders during the freedom movement of the country, needs to be brought together yet again and Hate and misconceptions generated by the ideology of religious nationalism of the likes of Roger and Updesh Rana need to be overcome by the humane morality inherent in different religions.",1

"ORLANDO, Fla. – This year marks the 20th anniversary of Matthew Shepard’s death, who his parents say was openly gay and murdered.

Shepard family wants to stop hate by teaching compassion

Family spoke w/ panel including LEOs, LGBT advocates

Spectrum News 13 spoke with Matthew’s parents, who spoke at an event called ‘Stay Proud, Be Loud’ in Orlando.

Judy and Dennis Shepard, who started the Matthew Shepard Foundation, speak around the country.

They say the goal of the foundation is to erase hate by replacing it with compassion and acceptance through their son Matthew’s story.

Dennis and Judy Shepard are from Wyoming. Their son was 21 years old.

“He was very empathetic, a peer counselor when he was in school. He was a good listener and cared about other people’s well-being,” Judy said.

In 1998, Shepard says Matthew just finished attending a LGBT meeting and went to a tavern where he met two men.

“He took a ride with them to another party or a home … they robbed him immediately. They continued to beat him in the cab of a pickup, took him out in the prairie, tied him to a split rail fence, (and) continued to beat him with a butt of a .357 magnum, swinging it like a bat,” Judy said.

He was found 18 hours later and later died at a hospital.

Tuesday, Dennis and Judy spoke with a panel composed of law enforcement and members of the LGBT community to discuss hate crime.

‘’We need to get information on hate crimes. We need to start making hate crimes reporting mandatory. So no matter what part of country, if they have they problem, they can start focusing (on) education to correct those problems,” Dennis said.

In Orlando, Orlando Police Department says there have been 16 documented hate crimes since 2010.

They say people should report it. Police have resources for hate crime victims, as well the LGBT Center.

Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson were convicted and sentenced to life in prison for Matthew’s murder.",1

The Loveland Police Department is investigating the physical assault of a 24-year-old man as a possible hate crime.

A Denver man told police that a man and a woman walked by him at the Loveland Public Library, 300 N. Adams Ave., and started a verbal argument that became physical at 1:30 p.m. Sunday.

Howard Dotson, who knows the victim through his homeless ministry work, told the Coloradoan that the man began punching the 24-year-old victim repeatedly while shouting an anti-gay slur at him.

The victim was injured and treated at the scene.

Loveland Police Department Lt. Jan Burreson said in an email the assault is being investigated as a possible bias-motivated incident, which is Colorados legal term for a hate crime. She also said remarks toward the victims sexual orientation were a part of the investigation.

Per statute, a bias-motivated crime occurs when someone knowingly causes bodily injury, uses words or conduct, or destroys property with the intent to intimidate someone because of their actual or perceived race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability or sexual orientation.

The man suspected in the attack is described as being bald, between 5 feet ,10 inches and 6 feet tall, wearing a green pullover sweatshirt and bluejeans. The woman he was with was described as being heavyset, between 5-foot-2 and 5-foot-5, wearing heavy makeup on her face and with a red flower in her hair.

Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to call the Loveland Police tip line at 970-962-2032.

BOCA RATON, FL (BocaNewsNow.com) — PBSO says the highly publicized fight in South County Park last week between two girls — one from Olympics Heights High School and another from West Boca High School was NOT a hate crime.

From PBSO:

BSO deputy met with West Boca Raton High School officials and confirmed the identity of all the suspects involved. The suspect’s and their families have been interviewed. All participants agreed the fight was over “a boy” and “a video that was circulated”. All parties AGREED to meet and to fight and a specific location and time. PBSO Deputy is preparing paperwork to charge the suspects involved with Simple Battery. Once complete, the investigation will be submitted to the state attorney’s office. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF A HATE CRIME.

Here is the original advisory from police:

On Thursday, December 21, 2017, two students; one from West Boca Raton High School and the other from Olympic Heights High School agreed to meet over an ongoing dispute. The victim, student from West Boca Raton HS, was under the impression the two were meeting to “talk”. The suspect, student from Olympic Heights HS apparently told the victim she wanted to meet to fight. The victim agreed to meet anyway. Both victim and suspect arranged to meet at South County Park at 2 pm. An altercation took place, hence the video that is circulating. The crowd dispersed after the altercation.

Sometime later, the victim’s mother called PBSO and PBSO deputy responded to the residence. It was at that time that PBSO learned of the incident. At NO time was “race” or “bullying” ever discussed

"Indian American Muslim Council (IAMC) condemned the killing of a Muslim man inside a Masjid in Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh, last week.

The 61-year-old Mohammed Farooq, who was working as a cleric, was bludgeoned to death inside the Noorani Masjid of Lalacheruvu locality. Farooq, hailing from Bihar, has been working at the masjid for the past four months.

According to media reports, the assailants desecrated the mosque. Burnt pages of the Holy Quran, cigarette butts, and signs of urination were found in the masjid.

“This murder of an innocent cleric and the desecration of the mosque represents a worsening of the human rights situation of Dalits and minorities in India. We call upon the Andhra Pradesh administration not only to take every step to apprehend the killers of Mohammed Farooq but also to check the hateful rhetoric and bigotry that enables such senseless and brutal violence,” said Ahsan Khan, the National President of IAMC, Twocircles reported. “This hate crime is an aberration in an otherwise peaceful Rajahmundry district which has a history of peaceful coexistence amongst people from all religious communities.”

The council alleged that India has been witnessing increased hate crimes and attacks on its religious minorities ever since the Narendra Modi administration came to power in May 2014. Attacks unleashed by self-proclaimed cow vigilantes in different parts of the country have increased to an alarming level, it said.

The country also witnessed shocking mob lynchings and mob attacks targeting minorities and Dalits.

“Andhra Pradesh has traditionally been marked peaceful coexistence amongst communities of all religious backgrounds even as many of the BJP ruled states have been gripped by rising tide of Islamophobia and hate crimes against religious minorities,” said Seema Salim, National Vice President of IAMC.

“We call upon the Andhra Pradesh state administration for an impartial and expeditious investigation into this hate crime in Rajahmundry while ensuring that this incident is not used to spread hate and discord in the community,” she added.",1

"Last year, our country suffered the loss of 77 LGBTQ individuals to senseless hate violence. Most of these hate violence victims were people of color and many were transgender and gender nonconforming. One year ago today, on June 12, 2016, the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando took the lives of 49 mostly Latinx LGBTQ young adults, wounded over 50 others and deeply traumatized hundreds. This massacre shook the LGBTQ community and our entire country to the core.

Along with 28 other LGBTQ hate-based homicides last year, the Pulse shooting made 2016 the deadliest year on record for hate violence against LGBTQ people in the United States. By June 11, 2016, the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP) had already responded to twelve hate-related homicides of LGBTQ people. Nine of those twelve victims were transgender women of color. The shooting at Pulse was deeply connected to the continuous hate violence being committed against LGBTQ people, and in particular LGBTQ people of color every day in this country.

Today, one year after the Pulse shooting, NCAVP is releasing its 20th annual report on LGBTQ and HIV-affected hate violence. For the 20th year in a row, we are calling the nation’s attention to the many ways hate—in the form of homophobia, transphobia and racism—can turn into violence against members of the LGBTQ community, especially those who are already marginalized, discriminated against and abused in our society.

The report, which analyzes 1,036 incidents of hate violence reported across the country, highlights that these homicides are occurring in a larger context in which anti-LGBTQ hate violence is persistent, daily and happening everywhere in our society. Hate violence is occurring at schools, workplaces, in our homes and communities. The majority of hate violence survivors experienced violence at the hands of someone they knew, not a stranger on the street. And in the current political climate in which attempts are being made to roll back or limit the rights and protections of LGBTQ people, already unsafe places are being made even more dangerous for our community members.

Last year, of the 28 non-Pulse hate violence homicides reported on in the 2016 NCAVP Hate Violence Report, 79% of the victims were people of color (18 Black and 4 were Latinx), 68% were transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) and 61% were transgender women of color.

Now, halfway through 2017, it is clear that we have not begun to turn the tide to end this cycle of violence. So far in 2017, NCAVP has received reports of 21 LGBTQ lives taken by possible hate-related violence, and the majority of these victims have been transgender, gender-nonconforming, and people of color.

Today, as we remember the Pulse shooting and celebrate the lives of those we lost in Orlando a year ago, let us also remember the other 28 LGBTQ lives lost to hate violence last year, and the 21 already lost in 2017.

As we lobby for gun reform, let’s also demand our elected officials stop dangerous religious exemption laws and other anti-LGBT legislation that contribute to a climate of hate and violence.

And when we attend vigils in the memory of Pulse, let’s also make a pledge to speak up when we hear anti-LGBTQ and anti-HIV hate speech or see people being targeted for who they are.

Let’s support community-based organizations that are working to prevent violence and find alternatives to systems that continue to criminalize and oppress our communities.

We still have a long way to go, but together, we can stand up for love and respect and make our world safer for everyone.

"Dating violence is an issue that plagues people across the world, and UMBC is no different. On March 24, a case of dating violence occurred when a UMBC student was assaulted by a non-student.

According to Deputy Chief of Police Paul Dillon, a male non-student allegedly assaulted a female student who he was previously in a relationship with on Walker Avenue. The female student sustained a very minor injury and required no medical treatment, but her phone and eyeglasses damaged by the perpetrator, which were both valued at about $1,000 each. He was later arrested by the UMBC Police and charged with one count of second degree assault and two counts of malicious destruction of property.

Dating violence is not a new issue, and for many UMBC students and staff, it is personal. On-campus organizations like Green Dot and the Women’s Center have been hard at work to combat issues like dating violence and provide resources to help victims of these issues.

According to the World Health Organization, about 30 percent of women worldwide who have been in a relationship report that “they have experienced some form of physical and/or sexual violence by their intimate partner in their lifetime.”

For women in college, statistics are much worse. In a poll carried out by Break the Cycle, an organization that targets abuse in relationships, found that 43 percent of dating college women reported “experiencing some violent and abusive dating behaviors including physical, sexual, tech, verbal or controlling abuse” and 22 percent of college women report physical/sexual abuse or threats of physical violence.

In order to prevent more incidents of dating violence and educate UMBC students on the issue, the Women’s Center is planning UMBC’s Take Back the Night 2018 on Thursday, April 12. In recognition of Sexual Assault Awareness Month, the event plans to take back the night from abusers through a variety of events and activities for attendees that includes speakers (including those who were victims of dating violence and abuse), a campus march against sexual violence and a community resource fair with opportunities for students to express their support for the cause through different craft activities.

For concerned or threatened students, a variety of resources are available on campus. The Women’s Center is open 24/7 and the University Health Services offers a Peer Health Advocate program where “students work together with associated UHS staff to provide educational programming to residence halls, classes, sports teams and Greek organizations on a variety of issues relating to sexual violence including Consensual Sex, Dating Violence, Gender Stereotypes, and Risk Reduction of Sexual Assault, along with other health issues.”

For the non-student who was arrested, the future does not look as hopeful. According to Maryland State Law, if the non-student is convicted of second degree assault, he could face imprisonment for 10 years and/or a fine not exceeding $2,500. Maryland Law defines second degree assault as “any impairment of physical condition, excluding minor injuries.”

For the two malicious destruction of property charges, the non-student could be imprisoned for up to three years and/or be fined up to $2,500. The non-student could face up to 16 years in prison and $7,500 in fines.",1

"One of two immigrants from India who were shot in a suburban Kansas City bar says the attacker was asking about their visa status shortly before the attack, which some have suggested was a hate crime.

Alok Madasani told The New York Times that while he and Srinivas Kuchibhotla were on the patio of the Olathe, Kansas, bar Wednesday evening, the man asked what type of visa they had and whether they were in the country illegally. They were.

Madasani says he went to get a manager, but when he got back to the patio, the man was already being escorted out.

Authorities say the man, 51-year-old Adam Purinton, returned with a gun and shot Madasani, Kuchibhotla and third man who intervened, killing Kuchibhotla. Purinton was arrested hours later in Missouri and is jailed on murder and attempted murder charges.

Madasani was treated and released while the other victim, Ian Grillot, remains hospitalized.

___

1:13 a.m.

A neighborhood bar in suburban Kansas City where one man was killed and two others were injured is scheduled to reopen even as the community tries to recover from an attack that witnesses said was racially motivated.

Austins Bar and Grill in Olathe, Kansas, will reopen Saturday. It has been closed since the shooting Wednesday evening while patrons watched a Kansas-TCU basketball game.

Witnesses told investigators Adam Purinton yelled at two Indian men to get out of my country before opening fire. One man, 32-year-old Srinivas Kuchibhotla, died. Two other men, 32-year-old Alok Madasani and 24-year-old Ian Grillot, were injured. Madasani was released from the hospital while Grillot remains hospitalized.

Purinton was arrested early Thursday at a restaurant bar in Clinton, Missouri. He is jailed on murder and attempted murder charges.

"Introduction

Good morning, and thank you so very, very much for the privilege of speaking to you in peace today away from the painful expression of bigotry taking place on hallowed ground, just a short distance from here. I am Prof. Brian Levin , director of the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. I come armed only with a sincere heart guided by the wisdom of others.

Before I commence my own statement on American values, and of solidarity and compassion with our Muslim friends and neighbors, I would like to offer the following words of our beloved advisory board member Trenna Meins, who tragically lost her husband Damian, the devoted father of her two beautiful daughters, to violence and hatred during the horrific terrorist attack that struck our community two years ago.

Our Beloved Citizen Speaks

As Americans we are blessed to live in a representative Democracy with a Constitutionally mandated separation of Church and State. “Sharia Law”, as this group (mis)understands it, is not present nor will it be imposed in the United States. This rally seems to be a thinly veiled, bizarre excuse to spread religious bigotry and racist propaganda. We do not support this and we are deeply disappointed that this site, which is so important to us, was chosen as the location for this misguided and unfortunate event. As a family, we strongly condemn any acts of hatred or intolerance. One horrific act of hatred has already occurred at the IRC [Inland Regional Center] - there is no need for more. We seek peace, not further divisive acts. We will never support any event or action that is not rooted in compassion and love.

Our Exercise of the First Amendment in Peace

I couldn’t agree with her more.

The Inland Regional Center, just down this very street, is indeed hallowed ground to our city, where 14 people, created in G-d’s image, whose only mission was to help others, were struck down in a cacophony of brutality disguised as faith. As the Koran clearly states in chapter 5, verse 32: “…if any one killed a person, it would be as if he killed the whole of mankind; and if any one saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of the whole of mankind…”

For those of us who remain, who love our community, in our own peaceful exercise of our First Amendment rights, it is we who will have the last word. And we will, because our city’s values of religious pluralism are at the foundation of what it means to be an American.

The Wisdom of Our Prior Leaders

One need look no further than the dreams of our nation’s founders. In 1790 George Washington wrote this to the Jewish congregation of the Touro Synagogue in Providence, Rhode Island:

For happily the Government of the United States gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens, in giving it on all occasions their effectual support.

Thomas Jefferson, wanted only these three achievements on his tombstone:

HERE WAS BURIED THOMAS JEFFERSON AUTHOR OF THE DECLARATION OF AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE OF THE STATUTE OF VIRGINIA FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND FATHER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA.

And in the law he so vigorously championed, he wrote:

No man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burdened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer, on account of his religious opinions or belief…

Presidents across the political spectrum have shared this value of religious freedom and pluralism. Six days after 9/11 President Bush counseled:

Islam is peace. These terrorists don’t represent peace. They represent evil and war….Muslims are doctors, lawyers, law professors, members of the military, entrepreneurs, shopkeepers, moms and dads. And they need to be treated with respect. In our anger and emotion, our fellow Americans must treat each other with respect….

Moms who wear cover must be not intimidated in America. That’s not the America I know. That’s not the America I value. I’ve been told that some fear to leave; some don’t want to go shopping for their families; some don’t want to go about their ordinary daily routines because, by wearing cover, they’re afraid they’ll be intimidated. That should not and that will not stand in America. Those who feel like they can intimidate our fellow citizens to take out their anger don’t represent the best of America, they represent the worst of humankind, and they should be ashamed of that kind of behavior.

His successor, President Barack Obama, who like Jefferson was maligned as a “secret” Muslim said,

But I’m also respectful that people of different faiths can practice their religion, even if they don’t subscribe to the exact same notions that I do, and that they are still good people, and they are my neighbors and they are my friends, and they are alongside us in our battles.

In the days after the terror attack on our community, anti-Muslim hate crime skyrocketed across the nation, but there wasn’t a single one in our city. We came together, rejecting the hateful impulses that poisoned others, and we continue to reject that bigotry today. Last year our Center found that hate crimes rose 14% in our state and 6% nationally, marking the first back to back annual increase in California since 1996, as we have become more polarized.

But there is always a peaceful path, if we have the reflection to follow it. When fires swept many of the nation’s cities on the night of Dr. King’s murder, Indianapolis mourned quietly after Bobby Kennedy’s spontaneous address there. He said:

For those of you who are black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and distrust at the injustice of such an act, against all white people, I can only say that I feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a white man. But we have to make an effort in the United States, we have to make an effort to understand, to go beyond these rather difficult times…. But the vast majority of white people and the vast majority of black people in this country want to live together, want to improve the quality of our life, and want justice for all human beings who abide in our land. Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago: to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world. What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence or lawlessness; but love and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country.",1

"By Alex Newman, Patch staff SOMERVILLE, MA – A shoplifting arrest in Somerville Sunday evening turned nasty when the suspect allegedly made repeated threats on the life of a police officer and members of his family. Brian Kobs, 32, of Medford, allegedly told the officer he had 10 years hanging over his head and had nothing to lose by killing a police officer. Kobs also allegedly shouted racial slurs at the officer, according to the police report. At one point, the officer took out his cell phone and began filming Kobs during his rant at Somerville Hospital. (Subscribe to Medford Patch or like us on Facebook for more local news.) The incident began around 6:15 p.m. Sunday night, when police were called to the Stop & Shop on McGrath Highway for a reported shoplifter. The caller, an employee at the store, began chasing the suspect through the parking lot toward Broadway. The suspect was described as a white male, wearing a gray shirt and black shorts. Witnesses told police the man had removed the gray shirt and was now carrying it as he traveled down Arlington Street. Police located the man, who later identified himself as Brian Kobs, on Arlington Street. Kobs was ordered to stop and allegedly ran across Arlington Street in an attempt to flee. When police caught up to him, he allegedly turned around quickly with his right hand clenched, prompting the officer to strike him with a closed fist, according to the report. Kobs allegedly continued to resist and attempted to strike police with his elbow as he was handcuffed. Police pepper sprayed him in an attempt to get him under control. Kobs was arrested for larceny last November and was known to Stop & Shop employees. The man who reported the shoplifting to police told them he recognized Kobs from the November incident and followed him on surveillance cameras as he allegedly concealed numerous health and beauty products in a bag before quickly leaving the store. The man said he identified himself in the parking lot and Kobs fled through the parking lot and out to Broadway. Kobs was transported to the hospital due to injuries sustained during the arrest. Once at the hospital, he allegedly made numerous threats on the officer and the officers family and launched into a racially charged rant while destroying hospital property. Kobs was charged with larceny over $250, resisting arrest, witness intimidation and threatening to commit a crime.

"A middle-aged white man born in the United States and living in Queens walks up to an elderly Hispanic man leaning on his cane in front of a store in Jackson Heights.

“Are you a Mexican?” he asks.

“Yes,” comes the answer.

“You’re the people making things difficult for us,” the Caucasian says — and then he punches the old man in the face. The victim is taken to the hospital and treated.

It’s a hate crime, right? Assaulting someone due to his or her national origin is one of the criteria the law lists, alongside race, color, gender and all the other possibilities that establish something as a hate crime. So there’s no question such an incident would count as one.

Or is there? On April 12, this exact scenario played out in front of a store on 37th Avenue — except the roles were reversed. It was a Hispanic man who accosted an elderly white person, asked if he was an American and then clocked him in the face. Just a few minutes earlier, the same person had slapped a woman in the face; no word on whether there was any talk involved in that incident.

And yet, when police made an arrest, charging their suspect in both attacks, there was no bias crime allegation filed. Why not? Is there a double standard at work in The World’s Borough? It’s true that 57 percent of people in Queens age 16 or older are foreign-born, but surely the other 43 percent still have equal protection under the law. The 14th Amendment says so, if nothing else.

Hate crime charges would take each count the defendant faces up one level, the class D felony assault on the elderly man becoming a class C felony (the slapping of the woman is a misdemeanor assault; the attack on the man is a felony because the victim is over 65).

Asked if hate crimes charges were being filed, the Police Department said “not at this time.” The Queens District Attorney’s Office simply declined to respond.

You could make the case that bias crimes shouldn’t exist as their own category at all, that it’s a person’s actions that should be punished, not the thinking behind them. Many have made that case, but any such debate now is academic.

You cannot, however, make a case for selective use of the statute. Based on what the victim said, it certainly appears that a hate crime was committed in Queens on April 12, and we see no reason it should not be prosecuted as such.",1
"A story out of East Lansing, Michigan that was reported this week in a Michigan State University dorm sounded ominous at first:

BREAKING: A noose found hanging outside a students dorm room is under investigation by MSPD and the OIE https://t.co/YC3iPKKBB8

The report sparked immediate alarm:

If its a student who did this, I pray to god they find his ass, expose his ass, and kick his ass out of school https://t.co/6wwnLvyF6p

BUT, upon further investigation, the story evolved just a little. Are you ready for this?

Wait, WHAT? A shoelace?

Lol. Racially intimidating noose at MSU turns out to just be a shoelace that someone accidentally dropped. https://t.co/825pocwxff

Via Lansing State Journal:

An item found on a stairwell door handle in a Michigan State University residence hall and initially believed to be a noose was, in fact, a shoelace, MSU police say.

MSU President Lou Anna Simon released a statement Wednesday morning condemning what appeared to be an instance of racial intimidation and saying, in part, that “No Spartan should ever feel targeted based on their race, or other ways in which they identify.”

By Wednesday afternoon, after further investigation, the university offered a different account of what had happened.

MSU police spoke with the student who lost both shoelaces which “are packaged in a way that someone could perceive them to look similar to a noose,” Cody said.",1

"In the Spring of 2017, a black student at American University had bananas hung by a noose near her room. In November of 2017, a white student tormented her black roommate for months at the University of Hartford, exposing her to bodily fluids and destroying her property. In early April at Kansas City’s Metropolitan Community College, a Muslim student was attacked on “Punish a Muslim Day.” Just this past month, a fraternity at Syracuse University was removed from campus, and its members were suspended for the release of a racist and ableist hazing video.

And this spring, blatant racism struck our own campus. A cultural and social awareness group created by black women sent out a co-sponsorship email In response, an acclaimed and successful senior replied via a private direct message that “[black people] can fuck off and go back to being slaves for all I care.”

Today, in a world of blatant racism and white supremacy, college hate crimes are on the rise. Between 2015 and 2016, the number of reported hate crimes on college campuses has increased by 25 percent. While the amount of reports may be due to the Obama-era institution of college crime reports with Title IX, this spike is extremely jarring, especially to students who belong to marginalized groups.

We have to be reminded that our own campus is no stranger to these racist and biased events. As many current upperclassmen on this campus know, in 2015, the Douglass Leadership House faced multiple physical and online attacks – including having other students urinate on their place of residence and receiving threats to specific house members via the then-popular social media platform Yik-Yak – for their presence on the Fraternity Quad.

The many resulting demonstrations and demands made by our campus’ community of color resulted in what we now know as the “We’re Better Than That” campaign. This campaign aimed to bring bias-based incidents to light and to create a more comprehensive education system for incoming first-years and enrolled upperclassmen regarding inclusivity and cultural sensitivity. This included the annual One Community program during Orientation.

This all sounds appealing on paper, but what is this program really doing? Let me break down the exact process, for example: When students come with complaints via the bias-incident report system (which is oddly done through the Burgett Intercultural Center and not the “We’re Better Than That” program), the system starts with a report that can be anonymous or not, an email to the student who committed the bias incident, and then an optional meeting set-up thereafter.

Based on personal experience, when a student files a report, they are met with a lack of follow-up and a lack of consequence for those who have committed bias-related crimes or attacks, and those who make the report have to meet with their attackers in a mediated session that the aggressor can choose whether to attend. This is the exact thread of events that occurred when the hateful statement was said by a student here on campus, and still, no consequences have been doled out, and the student has shown no legitimate remorse regarding their actions.

Last semester, instead of dealing with an impersonal report through a screen, I called the dean of students regarding the hateful spray-painted messages in the tunnels. These messages affected many students, and in my meeting with the Intercultural Center, I was even told that other students had come forward to report these messages. One statement read, “Have a better Thanksgiving that the Indians” and included a hashtag supporting Ben Shapiro — who was boycotted for appearing at another university’s event. Another read, “LBJ was a Klanner.” Both messages were shown to the Intercultural Center, a report was filed, and I was told two heavily disappointing things. That the school can’t condemn these messages because although they’re hate speech, they’re still free speech, and that I would be contacted soon (which never occurred).

It’s clear that this school uses its anti-racism programs and cultural diversity as a front to act as if hate crimes like those happening across America aren’t happening right in front of us and afflicting communities on this campus. Why is it that marginalized students have to deal with the dual stress of academics and bias- and hate-driven attacks at this university, but when they seek help via the programs the university boasts about, they don’t receive it?

This school has no problem boasting about its “ever-better diversity” and its increase in international student enrollment but it avoids the words “racism” and “hate” and instead opts for language like “bias” and tells students that we’re better than this vague concept of “that.” The administration lacks accountability and has not appropriately responded in these cases, and this is affecting marginalized students like you and I, who have to simultaneously deal with our immovable identities and the heavy load of studies all at once.

The comment directed toward me has yet to see any fruitful consequences for the student who said it, but the battle to hold the University accountable must continue. If you have faced a recent hate crime or attack on campus, please report the incident to this website.",1

WARREN

The attorney for Nasser Hamad, who is charged with aggravated murder in the shootings Feb. 25 at his home in Howland, filed a motion that says the charges should be dismissed.

Atty. Geoffrey Oglesby of Sandusky contends prosecutors “turned a blind eye” to charges that could be filed against the three survivors.

The filing by Oglesby says the survivors participated in “hate crimes” against Hamad by trespassing on his property, and their acts “would easily warrant charges against them up to and including felony murder.”

Five people went to Hamad’s home on state Route 46 after taunting Facebook messages between Hamad and two of the five people earlier Feb. 25, police said.

When they got there, a fist fight took place between Hamad and John Shively, 17. When it was over, Hamad went into his house, retrieved a handgun, went back outside and started firing at the five as they returned to their van, police said.

Joshua Williams, 20, and Josh Haber, 19, died; two were seriously wounded by the gunfire; and Shively was grazed by a shot, police said.

“The state of Ohio has not pursued charges against the three white Americans and has charged the Arab-Muslim American, and they were all involved in the same altercation,” the filing says.

Hamad also is charged with attempted aggravated murder in the wounding of the three others.

“The five came over as a terrorist group set firmly against Mr. Hamad because he was an Arab and a Muslim,” the filing says.

The filing suggests several other charges that could be filed against the three survivors, in addition to murder. They are breaking and entering onto Hamad’s property, kidnapping Hamad’s girlfriend, Tracy Hendrickson, and felonious assault of Hamad.

A separate filing seeks to disqualify Judge Ronald Rice of common pleas court and the county prosecutor’s office from continuing in the case, saying their roles in handling the criminal complaint filed against Hamad in court puts them in conflict with their duties now.

The same conflict would not exist if a municipal court judge would have determined there was probable cause to bind the case over to the common pleas court, the filing says.

The documents were filed with the court after 3:30 p.m. Wednesday, and no response has been filed by the prosecutor’s office.

A hearing is scheduled at 1:30 p.m. today before Judge Rice.

The two filings are among nine Oglesby has filed since late Tuesday.

One of the earlier filings asked Judge Rice to restrain deputy sheriffs, county jail corrections officers, social workers, psychiatric personnel and others from “engaging in conversations” with Hamad “relating in any way to the pending charges” or his “character, history and background, without the presence of defense counsel.”

The filing says in “similar cases, county jail personnel, law enforcement officers ... and inmates may attempt to obtain information from defendant in hopes of assisting the state in its case.”

Meanwhile, the first of three hearings is scheduled today in Trumbull County Family Court to hear testimony regarding requests by Tracy Hendrickson for protection orders against her sons, Dylan and Brice Hendrickson, and her estranged husband, Brian Hendrickson.

Family Court Magistrate Alexander Savakis on Friday approved “ex-parte” (meaning one side of the argument) protection orders against the three. The orders are good through March 30.

Savakis also set three hearings so all four parties can tell their side before a determination is made whether to grant a more long-term protection order or no protection order at all.

Dylan’s hearing is today, Bryce’s hearing is Friday, and Brian’s hearing is Monday.

Bryce, 20, is one of the five people who went to Hamad’s house. He suffered serious gunshot wounds in the shooting, according to police.

Brian has described Bryce as “improving” medically at a Youngstown hospital. He has undergone surgery on the roof of his mouth, and has a bullet in his neck, Brian said. He was shot once in the face and once in the arm.

Bryce is also one of the two young men Howland police said engaged in the Facebook taunting before the shootings, police said.

“My son Bryce has a very violent temper,” Tracy Hendrickson said in her protection-order application. “I do believe if he has the chance, he would kill me.”

When reached by telephone Wednesday, Brian denied all the allegations leveled at him and his sons in the applications, including one saying Bryce would hurt his mother. “Heavens no,” Brian said. “That’s so far-fetched.”

Tracy said she believes Dylan is “very angry at me” because of Bryce’s having been shot and his cousin Williams’ having been killed in the Feb. 25 shootings. His “temper is uncontrollable,” she said.

The other survivor is April Trent-Vokes, 42, mother of Haber and Shively. She suffered gunshot wounds to her head, arms, chest and legs. Police said she was the driver of the van that brought the four young men to Hamad’s home.",1

"A group of racists brutally assaulted a hijab-wearing woman outside a metro station in a reprisal attack.

A group of racists brutally assaulted a hijab-wearing woman outside a metro station in Madrid, Spain, in what is suspected to be a hate crime.

The woman, who has not been identified, was beaten so extensively that she had to be hospitalized for her injuries. She also reportedly suffered an anxiety attack.

The incident occurred outside the Usera metro station.

The alleged reprisal comes a week after Barcelona was targeted by a suspected Islamist militant, who drove a van into a crowd on Aug. 17, killing 13 people and injuring more than 100 people.

The Islamic State terror group later claimed responsibility for the deadly rampage.

Following the Barcelona terror attack, two mosques were also targeted in Spain. The Seville Mosque Foundation’s center was reportedly targeted with hate speech, as hooligans drew racist graffiti on the mosques walls, including messages like “killers, you’re going to pay.” The messages also included threats to behead Muslims with a machete.

Another mosque in Granada was also vandalized, after which people, including children, had to run out of the mosque as orange smoke covered their place of worship. According to senior officers, the police patrols near the citys mosques have now been increased.

Following these incidents of hatred, several Muslims rallied in Barcelona on Aug. 21 just meters away from the Barcelona terror attack location to protest against hatred and violence.

As for the Madrid woman, according to the police, she saw little of her attackers faces. Apparently, they were not wearing any armbands or any other clothing linking them to anti-Islamic groups.

"LOS ANGELES, CA — A woman was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport in possession of about $160,000 worth of crystal methamphetamine she allegedly brought into the country from Mexico, authorities said Wednesday. The meth, weighing about 11 pounds, was found hidden in the lining of the womans suitcase on July 18, said Laura Lee of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The 27-year-old woman, a U.S. citizen from San Ysidro whose name was withheld, had arrived at LAX from Guadalajara. She was directed to undergo a secondary inspection due to her nervous behavior, Lee said. A further inspection of the passengers baggage revealed a false compartment containing tape-wrapped packages of crystalized methamphetamine, which were confiscated, Lee said. — City News Service, photo via Shutterstock",0
"On Friday (May 26), a white supremacist fatally stabbed two men after they attempted to de-escalate the Portland, Oregon man’s violent hate speech against two women.

The incident happened on a MAX train when Taliesin Namkai-Meche, 23, and Ricky John Best, 53, noticed Jeremy Christian’s verbal assault against Destinee Mangum and her friend. When they intervened, Christian, 35, fatally stabbed them with a knife, Buzzfeed reports. Micah David-Fletcher, 21, sustained injuries after he tried to help the teens as well.

In an interview with Fox 12, Mangum expressed her gratitude for the men who stepped in to protect her and her friend. “I just want to say thank you to the people who put their life on the line for me, because they didn’t even know me and they lost their lives because of me and my friend and the way we look,” she said. “I want to say thank you to them and their family, and that I appreciate them. Without them, we probably would be dead right now.”

According to Mangum, 16, Christian yelled demeaning statements, specifically targeting his vitriol at Muslims. Mangum’s friend, who is Muslim (Mangum is not), was wearing a hijab. “He told us to go back to Saudi Arabia and he told us we shouldn’t be here, to get out of his country. He was just telling us that we basically weren’t anything and that we should kill ourselves,” she said.

"New Trier High Schools Mobile Learning Initiative will have all students use their own iPad for school by the 2014-15 school year. While some believe this plan will eventually save money for the district in the long run, other parents think that the program is unfair for non-wealthy families, an article by Business Insider states. Were in a wealthy district, but you cant assume that everyones wealthy, Mary Rita Kropp, a New Trier parent, was quoted in the article. The program pays an average of $620 for the iPad, keyboard, case and applications. Families receive a $270 subsidy, who can then pay $350 for a 16GB version or $450 for a 32GB iPad. Alternatively, families can pay $180 a year for three years in a lease-to-own option or just buy a 2n generation or later option on their own. Families will be able to seek financial assistance from the school if needed. Do you believe the iPads are too much of a financial burden for families? Let us know in the comments!

"Bullard High School student allegedly attacked for being gay Video

FRESNO, Calif. - A high school hate crime is under investigation in Fresno after a student was allegedly attacked for being gay.

Fresno police said the student was attacked during a fire drill at Bullard High School.



The student claims she was hit and verbally assaulted.

Logann Pruneda is an openly gay sophomore at Bullard High School.

She gathered in a crowd of students near the football field for the fire drill when she was struck in the ribs by something.

I get hit two more times with the apple juices that were full and closed, said Pruneda.

She said juice boxes hit her in the neck and back leaving bruises and visible marks.

Thats when she said someone started yelling derogatory slurs attacking her sexuality.

It was shocking to everybody, especially my friends and family, Pruneda.

I still have to catch myself from tearing up. Having her go through something like this you know, said John Pruneda, Loganns father.

She reported it to school officials who have since launched an investigation along with Fresno Police.

They are calling the incident a hate crime.

Bullard High School Principal Carlos Castillo said the school and district are taking steps to communicate with students.

We have created a tip line, an anonymous tip line for the school which we will roll out in the next couple of days, said Castillo.

He said no one has stepped forward yet with the identity of the student responsible.

We want to be able to help educate our students and our community and everyone else to make sure that no one else feels excluded or targeted by anyone, said Castillo.

The incident comes on the heels of comments made by Fresno Unified School Board President Brooke Ashjian.

He criticized LGBT inclusive sex education, which many perceived as discriminatory.

Pruneda said education is exactly what the community needs right now.

They cant change me. They cant change who I am, said Pruneda.

A $750 reward is being offered by former Fresno County Supervisor Henry Parea and two other donors to help find the students responsible.",1
"Updated 11:46 a.m. Wednesday Continuing an approval streak that began in 1980, San Marino voters approved the public safety tax extension Tuesday that needed two-thirds of the vote to pass.  The tax funds almost a third of department, and paramedics services and city officials have put certain things on hold, depending on the outcome of the public safety tax vote. I never take a parcel tax for granted, San Marino City Manager Matt Ballantyne told Patch Wenesday. I was relatively optimistic but I felt like I guess we were kind of in a holding pattern because we had some significant financial consequences if it didnt pass. So I guess now Im excited about being able to move forward. San Marino delayed and also put off . Fire Chief Priority The main priority is the fire chief position so were starting that process to appoint somebody by January first, said Ballantyne, adding that the approval of Measure S directly correlated with the hiring of a new fire chief, per a plan the city put together around June. The city is looking at two internal candidates for the fire chief position—SMFD Division Chiefs and , who have been splitting fire chief duties along with since s official retirement in June. A new fire chiefs salary will be in the range of $145,032-$181,284, according to San Marino Finance Director Lisa Bailey. Ballantyne said he is not in a rush to hire a new police lieutenant and that adjustment may correlate more with when Chief Schaefer looks to retire, but the city is still discussing plans for the position and will need to consult the management team and . City Hall Renovations City officials have also spoken about being dependent on the outcome of the vote, since even though the public safety tax funds only police, fire and paramedics, city funds would be considerably tighter if the tax did not pass. The proposed renovations are not up for further immediate city council discussion, but Ballantyne said they will likely be considered in coming months. Typically around January or February we do a mid-year review to see if we are hitting our targets and at that point in time well probably be discussing capital projects that have been placed on hold, one of which would probably be City Hall, but its up to the council, said Ballantyne. No other city projects or hirings are currently in discussions as a result of the public safety tax approval, said Ballantyne, who stressed that if Measure S had failed, the outcome would be much more difficult and result in a loss of city employee positions, so he is really thankful for the people that have been involved in promoting it. How do you feel about the public safety tax approval? What is your priority now that its been approved--fire chief, police lieutenant or City Hall renovations? Tell us in the comment box below.",0
"NASHVILLE, TN — Metro Police arrested two people suspected of tricking a box truck driver and robbing him and his passenger. According to an affidavit, a man was driving a box truck on Interstate 65 South Saturday when Timothy Preston and Thelma Travillion, travelling in a passing pick-up, caught his attention and motioned him to pull over. The driver, who had a passenger alongside, thinking that perhaps his rear door had come open, stopped on the Old Hickory Boulevard exit and says that Preston and Travillian stopped their pick-up truck in front of him.

Travillion followed up by asking if, perhaps, they had more than $5 somewhere else, according to the complaint. The victims called police, who were able to track down Preston and Travillion, who allegedly admitted to the heist. Both are charged with two counts of aggravated robbery and vehicle theft.

"City Auditor: Seattle Police Falling Short on Reporting, Training Officers on Hate Crimes

Some work to be done. SPD

In a report released Wednesday, City Auditor David Jones found some problems with how the Seattle Police Department (SPD) handles hate crimes and hate incidents, including how accurately the department tracks the data, how it trains officers, and how well it communicates with other City departments and law enforcement in the region.

As the Seattle Times reports, one issue is underreporting hate crimes and hate incidents. The problem was fixed in July, but it went on for at least four years. Between 2012 and 2016, around 17,000 reports per year were marked with “unknown” in the bias category — which means that if the incident involved bias, that part went unreported. This just changed in July, with officers forced to choose a bias category or write “no bias.”

The City audit also recommended officers receive more training in identifying hate incidents and that SPD work on crime prevention. It suggested City departments and regional entities should do better at coordinating information and responses to hate incidents.

The audit was requested by Councilmember Lisa Herbold (Chair of the Committe on Civil Rights, Utilities, Economic Development & Arts) after a rise in hate crimes and incidents in 2016.

Detective Elizabeth Wareing of the department’s Bias Crime Unit told the Times that bias incidents have been increasing since 2012 — and there’s been a jump in reports this year. She said it’s not clear how much of this is due to better reporting, but that the 2016 election definitely had something to do with it.

The legal term for “hate crimes” in Seattle is “malicious harassment” and can include threatening someone, injuring them or damaging their property because of a protected status they have, such as race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability and more. In Seattle, protected status can include homelessness, age, gender identity and more.

Police Chief Kathleen O’Toole wrote in response that the audit didn’t provide enough context for SPD’s response to hate incidents, and might give people the impression “that we do not take these crimes seriously — which is simply not true.”

"BERKELEY (CBS SF) — Two University of California at Berkeley students have been charged with felony vandalism for allegedly spray-painting graffiti against police officers and white people near the university’s campus recently, prosecutors said.

Berkeley police said the graffiti that allegedly was painted by Ismael Chamu and Peter Estrada, both 21, who also are charged with misdemeanor possession of tools to commit vandalism or graffiti, was found on June 28 on people’s cars and fences in areas south of the university’s main campus.

More specifically, Sgt. Peter Hong wrote in a probable cause declaration that the graffiti was found at a university dormitory at Durant Avenue and Dana Street, at the Clark Kerr Campus, in the 2400 block of Hillside Avenue, a fraternity house in the 2400 block of Prospect Street and the 2400 block of Durant Avenue.

Additional graffiti was found in the 2500 block of Dana Street, the 2500 block of Dwight Way, at Dana and Haste streets and at Haste and Ellsworth streets, Hong wrote.

Among the messages were “F— White People,” “F— the police,” “F— frat Boys,” “Kill Cops” and “Kill Yuppies,” “Eat the Rich,” “Class War” and “Black Lives Matter,” Hong wrote.

The graffiti also contained many messages about Philando Castile, a black man who was fatally shot by a police officer in Minnesota last year, according to Hong.

Chamu alleged in a Facebook post earlier this month being racially profiled, detained and mocked by Berkeley police seeking a burglary suspect on July 28, the day the vandalism was found. Chamu claimed he was unlawfully detained and held in jail for two days without any explanation or access to a lawyer, and then released with no charges.

The post and the Chamu’s profile page have since been removed from Facebook.

A Berkeley Police Sgt. Andrew Frankel acknowledged there is an internal investigation surrounding Chamu’s previous arrest on July 27.

A judge signed warrants for Chamu and Estrada on July 7 and Chamu was arrested at his recently acquired apartment in San Francisco on Thursday and Estrada was arrested at his apartment near the UC Berkeley campus on Friday, Hong wrote.

Chamu refused to speak to officers and invoked his right to an attorney, according to Hong.

Chamu’s Facebook page included many messages that “were consistent with the graffiti messages,” such as “f— the police, rebellion, Black Lives Matter, God Bless Antifa, White Nationalism and supremacy, tech development and its negative impact on Black and Brown bodies,” Hong wrote.

At Estrada’s home, officers found many items belonging to Chamu, as well as many others related to anarchism and anti-fascism, according to Hong.

Hong wrote, “Estrada had numerous stickers and literature, but several were notable in their messages: Antifas with the Adidas brand symbol, Defending Our Hoods with a picture of a knife, Die Techie Scum, Attack White Supremacy, and Attack the Police which were consistent with the graffiti messages.”

Estrada also declined to speak with police and asked for an attorney, according to Hong.

Berkeley police recommended that Chamu and Estrada be charged with hate crimes, but the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office didn’t file those charges against them.

A spokeswoman for the district attorney’s office said, “After careful and thorough review, the charges filed against the two defendants were in line with what the evidence shows us.”

Chamu and Estrada were scheduled to appear in Alameda County Superior Court Tuesday morning to be assigned attorneys and possibly enter pleas.

"Three Indian Americans have been shot in the U.S. in the last few weeks, two fatally. But if most Americans arent aware of that, they can be forgiven given that press coverage has been relatively muted. In the press in India, on the other hand, there has been wall-to-wall coverage along with purple condemnations of President Trumps vitriolic anti-immigration rhetoric, Reason Foundation Senior Analyst Shikha Dalmia points out.

Is the Indian press overreacting or the American press underreacting? Indias blanket coverage is irrational, but understandable. Americas apparent blissful ignorance is rational but less understandable, she notes. The fact of the matter is that Indian Americans, like other folks who look like Muslims, face a triple threat in America. And communities that feel threatened dont calibrate their response in a perfectly rational way based on data and stats.

"A Massachusetts man has been arrested and charged with a hate crime for allegedly holding a man hostage inside an apartment in Framingham and beating him for four days because he was gay, authorities said.

Police found 50-year-old Otoni Eliseu, who was allegedly held captive, bloodied and bruised on Saturday. Eliseu told officers he had been held against his will inside a basement apartment without food or water for four days while being beaten.

Jackson Sugrue, 19, of Framingham, is facing a hate crime charge because Eliseu alleged he yelled homosexual slurs as Sugrue assaulted him, the prosecutor said.

Police found Eliseu when officers responded to a call around 5:40 p.m. about a person being beaten with a bat.

At the scene, officers found Eliseu wearing only a pair of pants, lying on the ground covered in blood, bruises and scratches.

“He said he had escaped from an apartment where he had been kept against his will for the past four days,” prosecutor Dylan Krasinski said.

Eliseu was transported to MetroWest Medical Center in Framingham for treatment.

Police learned Eliseu and Sugrue knew each other after the victim told authorities he and the attacker had been hanging out when Sugrue suddenly became violent.

The apartment in question is located underneath the Philadelphia Baptist Church where Eliseu had been living.

He was in the woods a couple of weeks ago, Murilo DaSilva, the pastor of the Philadelphia Baptist Church, said.

Eliseu said he was held captive inside the basement bathroom without food or water.

DaSilva said Eliseu was recovering from a drug problem.

The victim told police he and Sugrue used crack together on Wednesday when Sugrue suddenly became violent.

Krasinski said Sugrue prevented Eliseu from leaving the apartment by taking his phone away and threatening him. Eliseu said Sugrue is a dangerous man.

Sugrue allegedly refused to allow Eliseu to drink or eat while held captive.

The prosecutor alleges Sugrue pulled Eliseu from his bed onto the floor and began attacking him repeatedly by stepping on his throat and choking him. Eliseu claims it was a hate crime because he is gay.

He attacked me on my back, on my butt, [saying] you’re gay, you like me, said Eliseu.

Eliseu also claims Sugrue beat him with a coffee table while yelling out homosexual slurs and referencing his sexuality, allegedly saying, I know youre gay. Eliseu also said Sugrue beat him with a fire extinguisher.

Eliseu told Boston 25 News he begged and cried to get out of the bathroom.

"Star Jones Ex Al Reynolds Comes Out as Bisexual: VIDEO

No one was killed or harmed in the incident, which took place just weeks after Hurricane Maria did significant damage to the U.S. territory. Circo Bar, which was operating on a generator on Saturday night to provide power to guests, did not experience significant damage.

The attackers fled before police could arrive to extinguish the fire.

"Jabara Family via CNN Khalid Jabara was shot and killed by his neighbor Stanley Vernon Majors who repeated called him and his family names such as dirty Arabs, and filthy Lebanese, the family said.

Jabara Family via CNN Khalid Jabara was shot and killed by his neighbor Stanley Vernon Majors who repeated called him and his family names such as dirty Arabs, and filthy Lebanese, the family said.

(CNN) - Stanley Vernon Majors, the Oklahoma man who gunned down his Lebanese neighbor in what prosecutors said was a hate crime, has been sentenced to life in prison without parole.

A jury convicted Majors, 63, earlier this month on charges of first-degree murder, malicious intimidation and harassment, a hate crime. His sentence Tuesday was confirmed by Kim Thomas of the Tulsa County Clerks Office.

Authorities said that in August 2016 Majors went up the front steps to his neighbors porch and shot and killed Khalid Jabara, 37, while he was on the phone with his mother. Prosecutors said he did it because the Jabara family is from Lebanon and Majors is a hateful bigot.

Jabaras family did not attend the sentencing, saying in a prepared statement that Majors was not worthy of any more attention.

Unlike the Defendant, we will continue to live, surrounded by love, cherishing Khalid, ensuring his legacy lives on, and working with others to prevent hate in our communities, the statement said. The world does not need more people like Stanley Majors, it needs less.

With that said, we refuse to give the defendant any more of our time, energy or thought - as he simply does not deserve it. He deserves exactly what the 12 jurors unanimously recommended - to spend the rest of his days, nights, hours, and minutes in prison.

Majors had terrorized them for years, the family said.

At the time of the shooting, Majors faced hit-and-run driving charges and was out on bail.

He was accused of running down Jabaras mother, Haifa Jabara, with his car in September 2015. She suffered a brain hemorrhage, broken ribs, a broken ankle, a damaged shoulder and a broken bone in her arm.

The Jabara family previously told CNN that Majors would stand on the property line between their homes and shout, dirty Arabs! Mooslems! and dirty Lebanese.

During the trial, Majors team built an insanity defense. His attorneys said the case was not about hate, race or religion, but about a man so mentally ill he viewed the family next door as a threat.

Attorneys said Majors feared the Jabaras, whom he thought were Muslims, would harm him because he is gay.

The Jabaras actually were Christians who fled civil war and religious persecution in Lebanon decades ago.

Assistant District Attorney Julie Doss issued this statement after the sentencing: With their guilty verdict, the jury sent a message by recommending a sentence which gave the maximum prison and fine punishments allowable by law for each count. Today, the judge followed that recommendation and therefore the sentence Mr. Majors received was the harshest punishment available in this case for the vile, vicious and despicable crimes he committed.",1

Shelton and the others used Grindr, a dating app for gay men, to get the victims locations in January and February of 2017. They tied up and assaulted the victims, according to the Star Telegram, int heir homes in Plano, Frisco and Aubrey.

According to federal authorities, the four men, who were armed, tied up the victims with tape, beat them and called them derogatory terms. The Star Telegram reported they also stole a car from one of their victims.

The other men accused of being involved are:

Nigel Garrett, 21, who was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison.

Chancler Encalade, 20, was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison.

Cameron Ajiduah, 18 at the time of the indictment, has a case pending trial.

This story originally appeared on ProPublica.

In violation of a long-standing legal mandate, scores of federal law enforcement agencies are failing to submit statistics to the FBI’s national hate crimes database, ProPublica has learned.

The lack of participation by federal law enforcement represents a significant and largely unknown flaw in the database, which is supposed to be the nation’s most comprehensive source of information on hate crimes. The database is maintained by the FBI’s Criminal Justice Information Services Division, which uses it to tabulate the number of alleged hate crimes occurring around the nation each year.

The FBI has identified at least 120 federal agencies that aren’t uploading information to the database, according to Amy Blasher, a unit chief at the CJIS division, an arm of the bureau that is overseeing the modernization of its information systems.

The federal government operates a vast array of law enforcement agencies—ranging from Customs and Border Protection to the Drug Enforcement Administration to the Amtrak Police—employing more than 120,000 law enforcement officers with arrest powers. The FBI would not say which agencies have declined to participate in the program, but the bureau’s annual tally of hate crimes statistics does not include any offenses handled by federal law enforcement. Indeed, the problem is so widespread that the FBI itself isn’t submitting the hate crimes it investigates to its own database.

“We truly don’t understand what’s happening with crime in the US without the federal component,” Blasher said in an interview.

But it’s long been clear that hundreds of local police departments don’t send data to the FBI, and so given the added lack of participation by federal law enforcement, the true numbers for 2015 are likely to be significantly higher.

The FBI has identified at least 120 federal agencies that aren’t uploading information to the database.

At present, the bulk of the information in the database is supplied by state and local police departments. In 2015, the database tracked more than 5,580 alleged hate crime incidents, including 257 targeting Muslims, an upward surge of 67 percent from the previous year. (The bureau hasn’t released 2016 or 2017 statistics yet.)

The federal agencies that are not submitting data are violating the law, Blasher told us. She said she’s in contact with about 20 agencies and is hopeful that some will start participating, but added that there is no firm timeline for that to happen.A federal law, the 1988 Uniform Federal Crime Reporting Act, requires all US government law enforcement agencies to send a wide variety of crime data to the FBI. Two years later, after the passage of another law, the bureau began collecting data about “crimes that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity.” That was later expanded to include gender and gender identity.

“Honestly, we don’t know how long it will take,”Blasher said of the effort to get federal agencies on board.

The issue goes far beyond hate crimes—federal agencies are failing to report a whole range of crime statistics, Blasher conceded. But hate crimes, and the lack of reliable data concerning them, have been of intense interest amid the country’s highly polarized and volatile political environment.

ProPublica contacted several federal agencies seeking an explanation. A spokesperson for the Army’s Criminal Investigation Command, which handles close to 50,000 offenses annually, said the service is adhering to Defense Department rules regarding crime data and is using a digital crime tracking system linked to the FBI’s database. But the Army declined to say whether its statistics are actually being sent to the FBI, referring that question up the chain of command to the Department of Defense.

In 2014, an internal probe conducted by Defense Department investigators found that the “DoD is not reporting criminal incident data to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for inclusion in the annual Uniform Crime Reports.”

ProPublica contacted the Defense Department for clarification, and shared with a department spokesman a copy of the 2014 reports acknowledging the failure to send data to the FBI.

“We have no additional information at this time,” said Christopher Sherwood, the spokesman.

Federal agencies are hardly the only ones to skip out on reporting hate crimes. An Associated Press investigation last year found at least 2,700 city police and county sheriff’s departments that repeatedly failed to report hate crimes to the FBI.

In the case of the FBI itself, Blasher said the issue is largely technological: Agents have long collected huge amounts of information about alleged hate crimes but don’t have a digital system to easily input that information to the database, which is administered by staff at an FBI complex in Clarksburg, West Virginia.

“I’ve long urged the FBI and the Department of Justice to improve the tracking and reporting of hate crimes by state and local law enforcement agencies.”

Since Blasher began pushing to modernize the FBI’s data systems, the bureau has made some progress. It began compiling some limited hate crimes statistics for 2014 and 2015, though that information didn’t go into the national hate crimes database.

“It’s fascinating and very disturbing,” said Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., who said he wanted to speak about the matter with the FBI’s government affairs team. He wants to see federal agencies “reporting hate crimes as soon as possible.”In Washington, lawmakers were surprised to learn about the failure by federal agencies to abide by the law.

Beyer and other lawmakers have been working in recent years to improve the numbers of local police agencies participating in voluntary hate crime reporting efforts. Bills pending in Congress would give out grants to police forces to upgrade their computer systems; in exchange, the departments would begin uploading hate crime data to the FBI.

Beyer, who is sponsoring the House bill, titled the National Opposition to Hate, Assault, and Threats to Equality Act, said he would consider drafting new legislation to improve hate crimes reporting by federal agencies, or try to build such a provision into the appropriations bill.

“The federal government needs to lead by example. It’s not easy to ask local and state governments to submit their data if these 120 federal agencies aren’t even submitting hate crimes data to the database,” Beyer said.

In the Senate, Democrat Al Franken of Minnesota said the federal agencies need to do better. “I’ve long urged the FBI and the Department of Justice to improve the tracking and reporting of hate crimes by state and local law enforcement agencies,” Franken told ProPublica. “But in order to make sure we understand the full scope of the problem, the federal government must also do its part to ensure that we have accurate and trustworthy data.”

Virginia’s Barbara Comstock, a House Republican who authored a resolution in April urging the “Department of Justice (DOJ) and other federal agencies to work to improve the reporting of hate crimes,” did not respond to requests for comment.

"Flagler County bucks trends. As many parts of the nation have strained from tensions between police and communities, Flagler County and Palm Coast have known a long period of calm, free of controversial shootings and underscored by significant community support for police. Likewise, as many more parts of the nation have experienced a surge in hate crimes, this area appears to be largely–but not entirely–avoiding the trend, while even local minorities such as Muslims speak of a spirit of comity and welcome.





Officials and experts in the field cite a variety of reasons: there may well be relatively few hate crimes in the region. But the categorization of crimes as such is highly subjective and dependent on individual decisions, and hate crimes in general overwhelmingly are unreported or under-reported.

“A hate crime is definitely a big deal here, because they are infrequent,” Flagler Beach Police Chief Matt Doughney, who spent a large part of his career policing Daytona Beach, said. “I think that it’s definitely something we take seriously, but it’s a complicated set of factors that go into calling something that.”

During the 2016 Presidential campaign, as now-President Donald Trump framed much of his populist message in vitriol, violence-condoning language and “us” versus “them” rhetoric that appealed to white working-class individuals, reports of hate crimes against Muslims, Hispanics, Jews and other minorities across the country soared.

From assaults and violence against individuals or on properties like mosques and synagogues to plain old hate speech at rallies, it would seem that hate crimes are on the rise.

For example, the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate crimes across the nation, documented nearly 900 reports of bias incidents in the first 10 days after the 2016 election, and 1,094 within the first month. Between Nov. 9 and March 31, the SPLC documented 387 incidents of anti-immigrant bias.

In 2013 the Dept. of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated that there are about 260,000 hate crimes committed every year. But only 6,000 are voluntarily reported to the FBI by local law enforcement.

In Florida, things are no different: According to the latest statistics from the Florida attorney general’s office, which covered the year 2015, there was a rise in hate crimes in the Sunshine State just as the presidential election campaign was ramping up.

From 2014’s total of 73, there were 102 hate crimes reported and classified by state law enforcement agencies in 2015, a 39 percent jump. That doesn’t necessarily mean there were more hate crimes. It could mean that jurisdictions are getting better at classifying cases as hate crimes.

A combination of greater apparent harmony but also under-reporting or awareness of hate crimes.

But in Flagler County, a hate crime seems rare. According to the Flagler County Sheriff’s Office, there hasn’t been a classified hate crime case since 2013, when a car was vandalized with swastikas. Both the Bunnell and Flagler Beach police departments say they can’t remember the last time there was a hate crime in their jurisdiction, though a cursory look at press reports suggests otherwise: in July 2015, swastikas were spray-painted on pavement in front of homes in the L Section. The perpetrators were never found.

And last fall, less than two weeks after Trump’s election, two kindergarten students from Imagine School at Town Center in Palm Coast came home with swastikas marked on their skins. There have also been the occasional displays of Confederate flags on public property, such as in the bed of pick-up trucks at Flagler Palm Coast High School’s parking lot (from where the flags have been removed, after complaints were lodged). But those acts don’t amount to crimes as opposed to school code violations (where the student code of conduct also forbids the wearing of any patterned colors that may be interpreted as gang-related, or the wearing of shirts imprinted with hateful messages).

A few years ago, the Masonic Cemetery off Old Kings Road, where those buried are predominantly black, appeared to have been vandalized, though then, too, it was not clear if the vandalism was an explicit expression of racial hate–or even if it was neglect appearing as vandalism.

“Hate crime classification is nothing that we’ve stressed to our officers,” said Doughney. “We look at our cases and look to see if any of the qualifications are there to classify something as a hate crime. You look at a totality of circumstances, talking to victims, perpetrators and see what occurs.”

Doughney and Mark Strobridge, the chief spokesman for the Flagler County Sheriff’s Office, said there are several factors to keep in mind when looking at Flagler County’s official lack of hate crimes in recent years.

First, calling something a hate crime isn’t actually a type of crime officers write up in a police report. The term “hate crime” is an enhancement to an already-existing charge a perpetrator is facing. That enhancement is often added by the state’s attorney’s office and comes about through further investigation of a case.

Second, to classify something as a hate crime, the act has to meet the legal definition explained in the Florida and federal hate crime statute. That definition reads:

“A committed or attempted criminal act by any person or group of persons against a person or the property of another person or group, which in any way constitutes an expression of hatred toward the victim because of his/her personal characteristics. Personal characteristics include race/color, gender/gender identity, religion, ethnicity/ancestry/national origin, sexual orientation, advanced age, mental/physical disability, or homeless status.”

As explicit as the definition appears to be, it still leaves plenty of room for interpretation, misapplication, or misunderstanding. Law enforcement officials may for example more easily detect cases of outright racism than they may cases of gender hatred, an awareness that only recently has broken out of the shadows but still lacks broader understanding.

Once it has been established that a criminal act has been committed or attempted, then the motivation behind the act is the key element in determining whether an incident is a hate crime. That’s where judgment and subjectivity begin to blur with evidence.

The mention of a prejudiced remark such as a racial slur does not necessarily make a criminal incident a hate crime, any more than the absence of such a remark makes it a non-hate crime. Local cops are frequently the target of racial slurs as suspects are investigated or arrested, but the rank racism that cops experience, documented as it often is through their body cameras, doesn’t result in hate-related charges for the suspect.

Strobridge said Sheriff’s Office officers do sometimes go back through a case and code it as a hate crime, reporting it as part of the UCR’s Florida Hate Crime Statistical Reports form.

FDLE’s Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) Program has developed the Florida Hate Crime Statistical Reports Form. This form is accessible to all agencies and can be downloaded from CJNet (Criminal Justice Network, law enforcement agencies have access to this system)

When a Hate Crime incident occurs, the local agency should complete the Florida Hate Crime Statistical Reports Form and submit it to FDLE.

Tom Foster, the Bunnell police chief, said his officers have all done training sessions on hate crimes. He isn’t surprised the numbers across the state fluctuate from year to year. The last three years’ data, 2013-15, contain the three lowest reported years of hate crimes being committed since 2002.

“Different jurisdictions are more up to speed on classifying hate crimes than others, and some are more vigilant about it than others,” Foster said. “It’s very difficult to have everyone adhere to the exact same standard on a case-by-case basis.”

Those are the legal definitions, and explanations why hate-crime reporting was down, and why there have been none officially reported in Flagler County in recent years.

But there are also other factors that may explain the non-reporting. Nancy Abudu, the legal director for the Florida chapter of the American Civil Liberties Association, has some ideas.

“Florida has done a real bad job; they are not a shining example of how things can be done,” Abudu said. “Police chiefs and officers need to do better with their classifications, because we know a lot more hate crimes are happening than are classified and being charged.

“If there weren’t so many hate crimes being committed,” Abudu added, “why would legislation about hate crimes need to exist?”

Abudu added that she fully expects the hate crime numbers in Florida to go up when 2016 is recorded, and that the increase the ACLU is seeing now is “because of a political climate that has emboldened people even more, to say things and do things against certain groups.”",1
"Washington: A US Navy veteran who yelled “Get out of my country!” before killing Indian engineer Srinivas Kuchibhotla and injuring two others at a bar in Kansas City last year, has pleaded guilty to three federal hate-crime charges.

Adam Purinton, 53, who is already serving life in prison on a state murder charge, pleaded guilty in US District Court in Kansas City yesterday to three federal hate-crime charges alleging that he targeted the men because of their actual and perceived race, color, religion and national origin.

He had earlier in March pleaded guilty to first-degree murder of 32-year-old Kuchibhotla and two counts of attempted first-degree murder in state court in the shootings of the Indian tech worker’s friend Madasani and a bystander.

The US Attorney’s Office in Kansas had filed hate crime charges against Purinton last June.

Purinton, a white man, faced a possible death sentence for the federal charges. Under the plea, though, Purinton will be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole on each of the three counts, with the sentences to run consecutively to each other and to the life term ordered earlier this month in Johnson County, Kansas.

“Hate crimes are acts of evil, and the Department of Justice has prioritized their zealous prosecution,” said Acting Associate Attorney General Jesse Panuccio yesterday.

In this case, Purinton embarked on a murderous rampage with clear premeditation to kill on the basis of race, color, religion, and national origin, he said.

“It was a hate crime, and he is being brought to justice. While we cannot ameliorate the irreparable harm to the victims and their families, we hope that securing this guilty plea brings them some measure of closure. And this prosecution sends a message across the nation: hate crimes will not be tolerated,” Panuccio said.

Kuchibhotla’s widow, Sunayana Dumala, did not attend the court hearing, but later released a statement thanking federal prosecutors and the FBI.

“Today’s change in the federal hate crime case against the murderer of my husband Srinu is a significant step to putting an end to hate crimes committed against people of color and from different cultures,” she said.

“The actions of the court send a strong message that hate is never acceptable.”

Several weeks before the shooting, Kuchibhotla along with his fellow engineer at Garmin, Madasani was at Austins when Purinton saw them and made a comment to another patron.

“Did you see the terrorists on the patio?” Purinton asked.

The patron told him they were from India and they were not terrorists.

On February 22, 2017, the two friends were once again having an after-work drink at the bar when Purinton approached and confronted them.

He demanded to know where they were from, then poked Kuchibhotla in the chest, and called him a terrorist.

“Get out of my country,” he yelled.

Bar patrons, including Ian Grillot, asked Purinton to leave and he was escorted from the business by employees. Purinton then went home, changed clothes and got his 9mm semi-automatic handgun.

He returned to the bar, covered his face with a scarf to hide his identity and went inside. He then fired eight shots at the two Indian men. Kuchibhotla was hit by at least four bullets. Madasani was shot in the leg.

As he fled from the shooting, Grillot ran after him. Purinton turned and shot him.

Later, Purinton called a friend and said he was on the run from police because he had shot “two Iranians.”

Earlier this month, the Johnson County judge had sentenced Purinton to nearly 78 years in prison as part of a plea agreement reached in March. PTI

"The Justice Department is sending a federal hate crimes lawyer to Iowa to help prosecute a man charged with killing a transgender teenager last year.

LGBT advocates have long been skeptical of Attorney General Jeff Sessions pledge to prosecute acts of violence against transgender people. But the rare move, outlined in recently filed court papers, is a sign he intends to do so even as the Trump administration has taken other steps to erode the rights of transgender people broadly. The New York Times first reported the decision Sunday.

The case involves 23-year-old Jorge Sanders-Galvez. He is charged with killing 16-year-old Kedarie Johnson in Burlington, Iowa, in March 2016. Authorities have not disclosed a motive. But Johnsons relatives tell local news outlets they believe the shooting was a hate crime.

"SOUTH BRUNSWICK, NJ — The motel fire that heavily damaged the Best Western on Rt. 1 Sunday night and sent two firefighters to the hospital for heat exhaustion was caused by a refrigerator coil that overheated, South Brunswick police said. The coil then caused the carpet to catch fire. A guest staying at the Best Western Princeton Manor Inn & Suites at 4191 Rt. 1 first noticed the fire in his room at 7:23 p.m. Sunday. He alerted other guests staying in the hotel and in total, police received about a dozen 911 calls about it. Kingston Fire Department arrived and observed heavy fire pouring out of the front of the hotel room and spreading to nearby rooms. Guests from all 50 rooms were safely evacuated. It took 60 firefighters from six different fire departments — Kingston, Monmouth Junction, Kendall Park, Plainsboro, Little Rocky Hill, and North Brunswick #3 — to put out the blaze. Thats a photo of the fire above, taken by South Brunswick police. Two firefighters were transported to University Medical Center of Princeton at Plainsboro for heat exhaustion and later released.

"MAHWAH, NJ — A local gas station attendant allegedly grabbed a womans buttocks when she stopped there early Tuesday morning, police said. The 18-year-old woman stopped at the gas station, which police did not identify, shortly after midnight. She was told by attendant Moeen Din that she would have to wait for a tanker truck to refill the underground gas tanks, said Chief James Batelli. While waiting, the woman went inside to the stations convenience store to buy a few things. Din followed the woman inside the store and slapped and grabbed her buttocks, Batelli said. The woman left and reported the incident to Mahwah Police. Detective Michael Grassi took Din to police headquarters for an interview.

"HOUSTON - A Houston man was charged Wednesday with a hate crime after he used a racial slur before he tried to stab an African-American man Tuesday, prosecutors said.

Harris County prosecutors said James Scott Lee, 32, chose his victim based on the victims race.

Prosecutors said Lee was heard saying, “I hate (N-word)s, and I’m going to kill me one today,” before he brandished the knife. They said the victim was able to escape Lee by jumping into a car and locking the door.

Lee was also in possession of brass knuckles at the time of his arrest, prosecutors said.

According to prosecutors, Lee is either mentally ill or has a deep-seated animosity toward African-Americans.

Its shocking even though things are happening like that lately it still shocks that people would want to do this, resident Steven Maiden said.

Lee was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. A hate crime enhancement was added to the charge.

Lee was being held in jail on a $250,000 bond.

Prosecutors said Lee could be sentenced to between five years and life in prison if convicted. Without the enhanced charge, he would face between two and 20 years in prison, they said.

"Susan Bro, the mother of Charlottesville car attack victim Heather Heyer, walks July 5, 2018, out of federal court in Charlottesville, Va., after a hearing for James Alex Fields who is charged with hate crimes in the death of her daughter.

Steve Helber, AP

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — An Ohio man pleaded not guilty to federal hate-crime charges Thursday in a deadly car attack on a crowd of protesters opposing a white nationalist rally in Virginia.

James Alex Fields Jr. entered the plea during his initial appearance in U.S. District Court here after being charged last week with 30 federal crimes in the Aug. 12 violence that killed 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injured dozens more. He also is charged under Virginia law with murder and other crimes.

Fields, 21, of the Toledo suburb of Maumee, Ohio, wore a gray striped jumpsuit and sat quietly, giving brief answers to the judge’s questions.

He entered the courtroom wearing handcuffs and shackles. The cuffs were removed when he came in then re-fastened when he left.

► April 23: Toronto is the most recent of many deliberate attacks involving vehicles

► Dec. 19: Heather Heyers mother to speak at street dedication

His lawyers made no request for bail.

He told U.S. Magistrate Judge Joel Hoppe that he is being treated for bipolar disorder, anxiety, depression and ADHD, and he is taking medication. But also said the drugs do not impair his ability to understand the charges against him.

James Alex Fields Jr., 21, of Maumee, Ohio, is accused of plowing a car into a crowd of people protesting a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., killing a woman and injuring dozens more. He also has been indicted on a federal hate crimes statute.

Albemarle-Charlottesville (Va.) Regional Jail via AP

Fields is qualified to receive representation from a federal public defender, Hoppe said, and appointed legal counsel for him.

The defendant said he has a high school education and has worked as a security guard. He grew up in Boone County, Kentucky, south of Cincinnati and purchased the vehicle, a 2010 Dodge Challenger, in Kentucky that authorities say was used in the Charlottesville attack.

While Fields and his mother lived in a Florence, Ky., condominium, authorities from the Boone County Sheriffs Office and the Florence Police Department responded nine times from November 2010 through February 2013 to the location, according to records.



Fields former classmates and teachers previously have described Fields strange behavior to The Enquirer.



Some survivors of the attack were among the roughly two dozen people in the courtroom. Also present was Heyer’s mother, Susan Bro.



The Unite the Right rally drew hundreds of white nationalists to the college town, where officials planned to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Hundreds more came out to protest against the white nationalists.



The car attack came after vicious brawling broke out between white nationalists and counterdemonstrators and authorities forced the crowd to disband.



Prosecutors allege that after the crowd broke up, Fields drove his Dodge Challenger toward the area where a racially diverse group of people had gathered to protest the rally. They say he rapidly accelerated the gray vehicle into the crowd.

► Aug. 16: Man, fired from job, makes no apology for carrying torch in Charlottesville

The car then reversed and fled.

Fields, whom authorities and others who knew him describe as an admirer of Adolf Hitler, was arrested a relatively short while later. He has been in custody since the attack.

Fields expressed white supremacist views on social media ahead of the rally, such as support for Hitler’s policies, including the Holocaust, according to an indictment.

As he prepared to leave for Charlottesville, a family member sent him a text message urging him to be careful and Fields replied, “We’re not the ones who need to be careful,” attaching an image of Hitler, the indictment said.

The morning of the rally, Fields engaged in chants promoting or expressing white supremacist and other racist views, according to the indictment.

► Aug. 14: No bail for Charlottesville car attack suspect James Fields

One of the federal charges Fields faces carries the death penalty although prosecutors have not decided yet whether they will seek that punishment.

The local commonwealth’s attorney whose office is prosecuting the state-level charges has said the federal indictment will have no effect on the state pending case. Fields is set to face trial on those charges later this year.

"Protesters gathered today in London to urge leaders of former British colonies to scrap their anti-LGBT laws. They expressed anger at Commonwealth leaders’ refusal to even discuss LGBT persecution.

Edwin Sesange from the African Equality Foundation reported:

More than 120 LGBT+ rights defenders protested today as the Commonwealth heads of government met in London. The protest was backed by gay Olympian Tom Daley. (See Tom’s statement below.)

They condemned Commonwealth leaders for refusing to discuss the persecution of at least 100 million LGBT people who live in Commonwealth countries where being gay is a crime.

They also demanded decriminalisation in 36 of the 53 Commonwealth nations that still outlaw homosexuality. Nine of these Commonwealth countries have life imprisonment for gay sex. In parts of two countries, Nigeria and Pakistan, LGBT+ people can be put to death.

The protest outside Marlborough House, the Commonwealth HQ on Pall Mall in London, included LGBT+ people from across the Commonwealth and was coordinated by the Peter Tatchell Foundation working with 14 other UK-based human rights groups. (See list below).

Protest organiser Peter Tatchell said:

“The Commonwealth is a bastion of homophobia. Seventy percent of the member states have anti-LGBT+ laws and fail to protect LGBTs against discrimination and hate crime. “The biennial Commonwealth summit has for six decades refused to debate, let alone support, LGBT+ equality. This year is no different. Once again, LGBT+ rights have been excluded from the leader’s agenda. “We’re saying to the Commonwealth: Time’s up on blocking debate. Time’s up on homophobic criminalisation, discrimination and violence. “Surely in 2018 Commonwealth heads of government should end the state-sanctioned persecution of more than 100 million LGBT+ Commonwealth citizens?”

Today’s protest included Commonwealth LGBT+ people who have been driven from their home countries after often violent persecution because of their sexuality or gender identity.

Hope Espoir from Cameroon said:

“When I was 18 I was caught with my girlfriend, beaten by neighbours and then arrested by police. My nightmare got worse as I was raped in prison. Upon being released I was forced into marriage with a violent man I did not and could not love, as I couldn’t suppress my sexuality. “Life got better when I fell in love with a local girl but the police came to arrest us one evening. Fortunately, I escaped with my life, but my girlfriend died after being beaten in police custody.”

Abbey, who escaped Uganda, said:

“I came from hell, with cigarette burns in both my palms and on my legs, scars on my face which resulted from the constant beating. I went through every kind of human degradation.”

Last week, LGBT+ campaigners delivered a petition to Commonwealth leaders signed by 104,115 people. The petition urged the leaders to:

Decriminalise same-sex relations

Prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity

Enforce laws against threats and violence, to protect LGBT+ people from hate crimes

Consult and dialogue with national LGBT+ organisations

Olympian and Commonwealth Games gold medallist Tom Daley sent a message of support to the protest:

“Shockingly, half the countries in the world that criminalise homosexuality are in the Commonwealth, which is why I am fully supportive of the Peter Tatchell Foundation and others who are trying to correct this terrible injustice.” “As I compete around the world, it’s important that I can focus on my sport and not worry about the reaction to my sexuality. I believe the Commonwealth should be a forum that protects the rights of all its citizens and not support governments that make criminals out of at least 100 million people.”

Tatchell added:

“At least 100 million LGBT+ people living in Commonwealth nations have no legal protection against discrimination in employment, housing, education, health care and the provision of good and services. This makes a mockery of Commonwealth values and the human rights principles of the Commonwealth Charter.”

Edwin Sesange from the African Equality Foundation said:

“It is time these 36 Commonwealth countries accepted their LGBT+ citizens. Homophobia should be expunged from the Commonwealth. Anti-gay laws in Commonwealth countries are mostly the result of colonialism. They should be scrapped.”

These organisations supporting today’s protest: The Commonwealth Equality Network, KaleidoscopeTrust, Peter Tatchell Foundation, UK Black Pride, African Equality Foundation, Equality Network, African Rainbow Family, Movement for Justice, House of Rainbow, Out & Proud African LGBTI, Micro Rainbow, Africa Advocacy Foundation, Rainbow Across Borders, African Eye Trust and Manchester Migrant Solidarity.

"Restitution to the victim will be determined at a later date.

Follow @ambazaarmag

A US district court last week sentenced Pennsylvania resident Jeffrey Burgess to three years’ probation and four months of house arrest after he was found guilty of physically attacking Indian American Ankur Mehta and abusing him with racial expletives.

Burgess, a resident of Pittsburgh, was indicted by a federal grand jury on a charge of violating the Hate Crimes Prevention Act in March 2017.

According to the indictment report, Burgess allegedly violated the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act by willfully causing bodily injury to Mehta because of the victim’s perceived race, color, and national origin.

Burgess pleaded guilty to causing physical injuries to Mehta in addition to calling him “terrorist.”

The incident that resulted in the sentencing of Burgess happened at a Red Robin restaurant in Bethel Park when Mehta sat next to him.

According to the statement given by Mehta, he ignored his assailant’s initial glances while sitting next to him and ordered for food, after which he tugged-in his headphones to listen to music.

After a while, when the music stopped, Mehta heard Burgess calling him a “terrorist” and hurling other vulgar slurs. He also said, “I don’t want you sitting next to me… you people.”

The victim, in his representation, claimed that despite him keeping calm, the atrocious nature of his co-diner escalated and, Burgess started physically assaulting, causing fracture and injuries to his neck and head, respectively.

The Almanac reported that this could be a case of Islamophobia as Burgess, before assaulting the Indian American, used anti-Muslim slurs and said “things are different now” — hinting at the change in administration.

According to the sentence delivered by US District Judge Nora Barry Fischer, Burgess, 56, in addition to the house arrest and four months of probation, must also perform 50 hours of community service, undergo treatment for alcohol abuse and participate in a restorative justice program administered by Center for Victims.

Restitution to the victim will be determined at a later date.

"The former police chief of a small New Jersey town has been charged with a hate crime after he was accused of using racial slurs and assaulting a suspect.

Frank Nucera Jr. was arrested Wednesday and charged with a hate crime and violating a suspect’s civil rights through excessive force, based on recordings taken secretly by another member of the police force, according to the complaint as reported by NBC News.

In the primary incident outlined in the complaint, Nucera allegedly grabbed an 18-year-old suspect by the head, slamming it into a metal doorjamb and hitting him in the head with his arm while apprehending the suspect and his girlfriend for not paying for their hotel room.

Nucera served as chief of Bordentown, a 12,000-person community that is 76 percent white and 9 percent black, and retired in February after the investigation into his behavior began.

Other complaints allege Nucera’s repeated use of racial slurs and profanity, using police dogs to intimidate black people, using racial slurs to refer to black suspects and equating black people with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria terror group.

In one instance, Nucera reportedly said that n-----s are like ISIS, they have no value.

Acting U.S. Attorney in New Jersey William Fitzpatrick said in a statement that Nucera “dishonored” the force with his behavior, according to NBC.

The nobility of police officers is rooted in their selfless commitment to protect our communities and their pledge to honor our constitutional values, Fitzpatrick said. As chief of the Bordentown Township Police Department, the defendant dishonored the profession by doing neither.

Nucera was released on unsecured $500,000 bond and ordered to give up all his guns. He faces a maximum of 10 years in prison.",1

"(Newser) – A hostile and apparently ill-informed Chicago man who ranted at a woman for wearing a Puerto Rico shirt in the US is now facing felony hate crime charges. Robert Foley, spokesman for the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office, says the office approved the charges, which were enhancements of the misdemeanor assault and misdemeanor disorderly conduct charges Timothy Trybus was already facing, after a review of the incident, the Chicago Tribune reports. Video of the incident shows a man identified as Trybus, 62, harassing Mia Irizarry inside Caldwell Woods park last month and berating her for wearing the flag of Puerto Rico, a US commonwealth, instead of an American flag.

The charges against Trybus are Class 3 felonies, punishable by probation or up to five years in prison on each charge if convicted, CBS News reports. Police say Trybus was intoxicated when they arrested him. His record includes charges of domestic battery going back at least 20 years, the Tribune reports. Cook County Commissioner Jesus Garcia says he agrees with the hate crime charges and thinks they should have been filed sooner. From the video, its reasonable to conclude that the way this individual confronted the woman constituted a hate crime, he says. It was threatening and menacing and obviously full of racial ethnic hatred. (An officer criticized for apparently ignoring Irizarrys requests for help has resigned.)

"MIAMI BEACH, Fla. - Four men surrendered to authorities Tuesday, two days after they attacked a gay couple following the Miami Beach Gay Pride Parade, police said.

Miami Beach police said each suspect faces felony charges. They were identified as Juan C. Lopez, Adonis Diaz, Pablo Romo-Figueroa, all 21, and Luis Alonso-Piovet, 20.

Police said the state attorneys office will decide whether the men will face a hate-crime enhancement in addition to the existing charges.

That makes me happy that, at least, they were nice enough to admit that they committed the crimes, said Dimitri Lugonov, one of the victims.

The arrests came after Miami Beach officials met with LGBT leaders Tuesday about the attack.

We celebrate Pride because, frankly, its important to us that people know that this is a city that believes in diversity and embraces inclusivity, Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber said.

Lugonov and Rene Chalarca told police they were attacked by a group of men after they shared a hug while waiting to use a restroom at Lumus Park in the 500 block of Ocean Drive.

Chalarca and Lugonov said one of their attackers yelled an offensive Spanish word for homosexuals before hitting them several times.

I fell on the ground and somebody started beating me up. I didnt even see the faces, Logunov said. It was that quick. He tried to protect me.

He hit him, and then I grabbed the guy, and he was already on the floor, and the other people came and started hitting him, Chalarca said.

According to a police report, a bystander who saw the attack and tried to intervene was pushed to the ground and suffered a cut to the back of his head.

We confronted the guys and asked them, What the hell? Why did you guys do that? Thats unfair. And thats all I remember, Helmut Estrada said.

Police said Chalarca and Lugonov had cuts and bruises on their faces and were treated by paramedics at the scene. Estrada was taken to Mount Sinai Medical Center for treatment.

Chalarca and Lugonov believe they were targeted because they are gay.

We were together. So for me, its like, yes, it was a hate crime, Chalarca said.

Police said surveillance cameras recorded the suspects as they left the scene of the attack.

One of the men was wearing a Florida International University T-shirt, leading the university to release a statement about the attack.

FIU stands for tolerance, diversity and inclusion, the statement read. The alleged actions of these individuals do not represent FIU values.

"ANNAPOLIS, MD — One accused teenage robber is under arrest, but Annapolis Police are still looking for a second robber who held up three people sitting inside a parked vehicle in the 500 block of South Cherry Grove Avenue on Saturday. The victims were approached about 1 a.m. by a male suspect who knocked on the window. After one of the victims lowered the vehicle window the suspect reportedly pointed a handgun at the occupants and ordered them out of the vehicle, police say. A second robber pointed a gun at the victims while the first suspect demanded money and took their wallets. Then the suspects fled the area on foot. Detectives identified the suspect who first approached the vehicle as Jariq Downs, 16, of Annapolis and obtained an arrest warrant for him. He was located that evening in the 1100 block of Madison Street and arrested. Police say Downs was charged as an adult with 17 criminal counts relating to the armed robbery. He is being held without bond at the Jennifer Road Detention Center. Anyone with information about the robbery is asked to call police at 410-260-3439. Image via Annapolis Police",0

"By Caitlin Brown A state probation officer working in Middlesex County was taken into custody today on charges of accepting bribes from a client who was serving a probationary term for drug offenses, according to Middlesex County Prosecutor Andrew C. Carey. Rhonda Battle, 46, of Roselle, was charged with official misconduct and bribery, both third degree offenses, for taking an undisclosed amount of cash on various occasions between January 1, 2014 and December 23, 2014. Battle is being held on $20,000 bail set in New Brunswick by Superior Court Judge Bradley Ferencz, who said the defendant may be released after posting 10 percent of the amount. Battle was charged during an investigation by Detective Nicholas Chiorello of the Middlesex County Prosecutors Office. The investigation determined that Battle accepted cash amounts to ensure the client passed drug testing and would not be found in violation of the conditions of a court-ordered probationary term. Battle had been employed as a probation officer and was assigned to work with clients who had been admitted to the state Superior Courts Drug Court program at the Middlesex County Courthouse in New Brunswick. As an alternative to incarceration, the program offers counseling, rehabilitation and probationary terms to first-time offenders. Prosecutor Carey said the criminal justice system cannot properly function without the publics confidence. It is incumbent upon the Middlesex County Prosecutors Office to help maintain the integrity of the Drug Court, which offers a viable means of addressing the problems of addiction, Prosecutor Carey said. The program will only continue to be successful if those who help administer it remain above reproach. The investigation is active and is continuing. Anyone with information is asked to call Detective Chiorello of the Middlesex County Prosecutors Office at (732) 745-3848. As is the case with all criminal defendants, the charges against Battle are merely accusations and she is presumed innocent until proven guilty.

"Police said Wednesday that the man who killed three white men in a Fresno, California shooting spree was a “racist filled with hate” and has shown no remorse for the murders.

“This is a hate crime based on race and gender,” Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer told reporters at a news conference.

Thirty-nine-year-old Kori Ali Muhammad, who is black, wanted to kill as many white people as possible after a warrant for his arrest was released in the murder of a 25-year-old Motel 6 security guard Carl Williams last week.

Muhammad told investigators he killed Williams because he felt “disrespected” by him during an altercation at the motel. He said he fled the scene and hid out on a nearby 7/11 rooftop while police conducted an investigation.

Chief Dyer said when the suspect realized he was wanted in the murder of Williams, he “didn’t want to go down as someone who just shot a security guard” but wanted to shoot as many white people as possible before his arrest.

Muhammad told police he did not like white men and said they were responsible for “keeping black people down.”

On Tuesday, Dyer shot and killed thirty-four-year-old PG&E worker Zachary David Randalls, Mark James Gassett, 37, who was walking in the neighborhood, and 58-year-old David Martin Jackson outside a Catholic charity office.

Police said the firearm used in the crime was allegedly stolen by a hispanic man who spoke with Muhammad after the shooting spree and is urged to turn himself in.

Chief Dyer told reporters that its very rare for a homicide suspect to cooperate with investigators in recounting the killings and he believes Muhammad was proud of what he did.

Dyer said Muhammad told police that he gave himself up because he respects Fresno officers, didnt want them to shoot him and is not a coward.

Muhammad yelled Allahu akbar, or God is great, during his arrest and described himself as Muslim but says he practiced voodoo rituals and prays to seven different gods.

"INWOOD, NY — A homeless man assaulted in Inwood last week after catcalling another mans girlfriend has died of his injuries, police told Patch. Lucio Bravo, 69, suffered serious injuries to the head when Branlee Gonzalez attacked him and another man. He was pronounced dead on Tuesday, police told Patch. Gonzalez, who is facing first- and second-degree assault charges, pummeled Bravo and another homeless victim early Thursday morning because the two victims catcalled his girlfriend. The assault occurred around 3:30 a.m. Thursday in in front of a Supermarket on Sherman Avenue between Dyckman and Academy streets, police said. Bravo was taken to Saint Barnabas hospital after the attack and the other man, an unidentified 39-year-old man, suffered bruising but refused medical attention, police told Patch. Surveillance video released by police captured the attack. The NYPD video shows a man police have identified as Gonzalez throw what appears to be a sucker punch at one of the seated victims before launching a hail of punches. When the other victim attempts to get involved in the fight, he too is punched in the head several times. During the assault, a woman can be seen attempting to pull Gonzalez away from the two victims. Gonzalez was arrested Monday and charges with two counts of first- and second-degree assault, police told Patch. Gonzalez will appear in court on Friday, court records show.

"A Goshen, Calif., man is fighting for his life in a Fresno, Calif., hospital after being beaten and stabbed multiple times solely because of his race, authorities say.



According to the Visalia Times-Delta, the 60-year-old man, who is black, is expected to recover from his injuries, but his attack has left many residents in Goshen shocked.

One resident said that on Sunday afternoon, a group of men yelled slurs at the older man, who tried to get away from his attackers. When paramedics and sheriff’s deputies arrived at the scene, they found the 60-year-old, who was not identified, suffering from multiple stab wounds.

Violent-crimes detectives immediately shut down roads and began interviewing neighbors, ultimately arresting 25-year-old Hadden Kennedy and 39-year-old Jodan Peck, who live about a block away from the victim, according to neighbors.

Tulare County Sheriff’s Lt. Duane Cornett said that the case has been submitted to the district attorney’s office as a hate crime.

“Our investigation showed that during the attack, racial slurs were used,” Cornett said.

Neighbors told authorities that the victim had been being harassed by his alleged attackers over the past few days when things escalated Sunday.

“It’s a very sad situation,” Gina Torrez, a Goshen resident, told the Times-Delta. “Seems like a racially motivated hate crime; so upsetting that these issues are still present.”

Residents said they were speaking out about what happened, despite fear of retaliation, to make sure people know that racism will not be a part of their county.

Both Peck and Kennedy were booked into the Tulare County Pretrial Facility on suspicion of attempted murder. On Tuesday, the district attorney’s office added hate crime charges, the Fresno Bee notes.

"Most of all, those who knew Kedarie said he never seemed to be struggling with issues about his gender identity or his sexual orientation or what other people might think about any of it. “Kedarie was just Kedarie, and that was that,” said Tremell Jones, 17, a friend who was with him the night he disappeared.

Not long before midnight on March 2, 2016, the police received reports of gunshots in an alley behind Walnut Street. They found a body in the tall grass. Kedarie was shot twice in the chest. He had no shoes on, and his shirt was pushed up. A bleach bottle was nearby.

Prosecutors say Mr. Sanders-Galvez and a cousin, Jaron Purham, 26 — both of whom lived most of the time in the St. Louis area — had observed Kedarie only a few hours earlier in Burlington’s Hy-Vee grocery store, where he liked to hang out and use the Wi-Fi. Surveillance video from the store showed him dressed that evening in long hair extensions, a pink headband and leggings. Just before Kedarie vanished, when he left the store and stopped at a friend’s home to borrow bras from her, he mentioned that he was worried about someone following him, the friend has testified.

The prosecutors have not said exactly what they believe took place in the less than two hours before Kedarie was found dead, except to say that the two men liked women and had brought him back to a house where they had been staying and where they often had sex with various women. The prosecutors’ suggestion, though not explicitly made before jurors, was that Mr. Sanders-Galvez and Mr. Purham thought that Kedarie was a woman and grew enraged and violent when they discovered otherwise. Kedarie’s backpack and shoes were found in the house.

Lawyers for Mr. Sanders-Galvez, who has sat silently in a suit and tie in the courtroom in Keokuk, Iowa, south of Burlington, where the trial is taking place, have yet to offer a defense. In an interview, one of the defense lawyers, Curtis Dial, said simply that his client “did not do it. That’s it.”

In charging the men with murder — but not hate crimes — the local authorities concluded that the killing did not amount to a hate crime under Iowa’s statute, which bars committing crimes against people for reasons that include race, religion and sexual orientation. Gender identity is not covered by the state’s statute, and efforts last year to add it died in the Republican-held state House. A first-degree murder conviction, the local authorities noted, carries a serious penalty: life in prison.",1

"The murder of a University of Wyoming student 20 years ago still resonates in a dramatic play called The Laramie Project.

The victim, Matthew Shepard, 21, was robbed and beaten by two young men and left to die on a fence outside Laramie, Wyo., in October 1998. Because Shepard was gay, his death became a symbol for the need for hate-crime legislation, and ultimately led to U.S. Congress to pass the Matthew Shepard/James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act in 2009.

The Laramie Project, which is being presented this weekend and next in the Kathleen Howland Theatre at Avenue Arts in downtown Canton, was created by the Manhattan-based Tectonic Theatre Projects, whose members traveled to Laramie following Shepards death and the resulting murder trials to conduct interviews with hundreds of townspeople. The play is a montage of verbatim quotes, plus court testimony and news reports. Eight actors portray more than 60 actual people.

I interviewed Jared Sparks, director of The Laramie Project, and cast members Brad Vincent and Stephen Ostertag about the play and its ongoing resonance.

Q. How would you describe the play?

OSTERTAG: Its almost like a documentary. You have eight people who are each portraying multiple characters, so its really fluid, and the transitions are helped by narration. It starts off with people talking about who Matthew was and how they knew him, into actual moments of what happened and what people heard, leading into the media circus, the aftermath of him passing away and the trials.There are many moments in the show that are emotionally charged if we do it right.

SPARKS: Its heart-wrenching, a very powerful story. Its all real dialogue, so the whole show is written in the moment. I honestly have the most talented cast I could hope for. When I had them all show up to audition, my first question to the was, What does this story mean to you? So I cast this show for passion — passion for the topic and for telling the story.

Q. Can you tell me about some of the people who you portray?

VINCENT: I play Doc, who was a limousine driver who drove Matthew and struck up a friendship with him. I play Matt Galloway, who was working at the bar the night Matthew was taken out and robbed and ultimately murdered. I play a guy who shared a cell with one of the perpetrators and asked the guy why he did it. And I have to take the stage as the Rev. Fred Phelps of the Westboro Baptist Church, who is the most offensive character in the world to me. He and his people picketed a 21-year-old mans funeral screaming God hates fags and Matts in hell to his family. I have to stand there and do that every night. I walk offstage and fall to pieces. Its so against everything I am.

OSTERTAG: I play Jon Peacock, who was Matthews college adviser and is focused on the idea of a young person who had a life ahead of him that was snuffed out too early. I play a man named Murdoch who says he doesnt dismiss the actions of the people who beat Matthew but Matthew was sort of asking for it. It took awhile for those of us playing hateful characters to stop cringing when we say some of those lines. I also play Dennis Shepard, Matthews father, in a courthouse monologue that is very charged for me.

Q. What makes The Laramie Project still relevant?

VINCENT: Its a very powerful piece. Twenty years have gone by and the hatred that caused (Shepards death) is still prevalent. It hasnt dissipated. It might be directed at different groups, but its still out there. The (plays) message of love and hope needs to be reiterated again and again.

OSTERTAG: The play is relevant because were still dealing with so many of these prejudicial issues — about race, sexual identity, religion. Theres a lot of division based on one single aspect of a person. You believe this, so theres a barrier. You love this way, so there is a barrier. We need to come from a place of empathy.

SPARKS: I think its even more relevant now in todays political climate. It shows how the problems people have with different subgroups are nothing new. The play shows how far weve come and how far we have left to go. I would hope the audience will walk away thinking about how they can individually make the world a better place.",1

"UPDATE 8:15 PM- Three train cars carrying sulfuric acid have been placed back on the tracks under Interstate Highway 680 in Martinez and moved away from the area where they derailed this morning, according to firefighters. As of 5:30 p.m. Wednesday evening, crews had managed to upright two of the three cars, and were working to get the third car back on the tracks. It was the most severely damaged of the three, according to Contra Costa County Fire Protection District Fire Marshal Robert Marshall. Firefighters announced via Twitter that all the cars had been put back on the tracks and the scene had been turned back over to the railroad company at 7:48 p.m. The tanker cars, which did not leak their contents, initially derailed under the highway near Marina Vista Avenue at about 7:30 a.m., Union Pacific Railroad spokesman Francisco Castillo Jr. said. Castillo said a Union Pacific crew delivered another companys 20 train cars on Monday from its tracks to an industry line used by a company called Eco Services. According to county officials, the company removes certain substances from the acid. When the train was being moved, three of its tanker cars came off the tracks, Castillo said. One of the cars tipped over at a roughly 45-degree angle. County hazmat crews that initially responded determined the tankers were not leaking their sulfuric acid contents. Local activist Andrés Soto, a spokesman for Benicians for a Safe and Healthy Community, was at the scene this afternoon. He called the incident a near miss. The whole community dodged a bullet, he said, given that the sulfuric acid didnt leak out. Soto, whose group is against a proposal to deliver crude oil by rail to a Valero refinery in Benicia, said this represents a warning sign. Once again we learn transporting hazardous materials by railroads is a dangerous business, he said. ------------------------ UPDATE 5:15 PM- Crews are in the process of placing three train cars carrying sulfuric acid back on tracks under Interstate Highway 680 in Martinez after they derailed this morning, according to a rail company official.

"The year 2016 was the deadliest on record for LGBTQ people, according to the 20th annual report from the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (the NCAVP) published on Monday.

In absence of a centralized national database monitoring anti-LGBTQ violence, the NCAVP gathered data in the 11 states where the organization has local chapters (Arizona, California, Illinois, Ohio, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New York, Virginia, Vermont, Wisconsin).

The report’s publication falls on the one-year anniversary of the worst mass shooting in U.S. history, the Pulse Nightclub massacre in Orlando, Florida, in which 49 people lost their lives. The shooter, Omar Mateen, opened fire in the gay club he had reportedly frequented for years before pledging allegiance to the Islamic State militant group (ISIS) in a 911 phone call.

“The Pulse shooting is a very, very complicated situation and there were many factors going into that shooting in terms of motivations. What we do know is that the LGBTQ community really felt like it was directed towards them and felt the impact of that as a community,” Emily Waters, senior manager of national research and policy at the New York City Anti-Violence Project, tells Newsweek.

A year on from the Pulse shooting, Waters says the attack needs to be understood as a consequence of broader systemic issues of homophobia, transphobia, biphobia, xenophobia, racism at play within society.

Even without counting the 49 victims of the Orlando shooting as part of the total, there was still a 17 percent rise in anti-LGBTQ homicides, from 24 in 2015 to 28 in 2016. This was the highest number of victims recorded since NCAVP began publishing the report 20 years ago.

Among these, victims were more likely to be people of color, transgender or gender nonconforming, and below the age of 35. Of the 28 homicides NCAVP reported, 61 percent were transgender women of color.

The report aggregated all 28 stories, for instance that of 16-year-old Kedarie/Kandicee Johnson, a Black genderfluid teen who is one of the youngest victims on the report, who was shot multiple times on March 2, 2016, but whose murder remains unsolved.

The NCAVP also collected data on 1,036 incidents of hate violence against LGBTQ and HIV-affected people. The most common types of hate violence reported were verbal harassment (20 percent), threats or intimidation (17 percent), and physical violence (11 percent). Nearly half of the incidents recorded took place in private residences or the workplace. People with disabilities in particular were twice as likely to experience violence in a private residence than people without disabilities.

The NCAVP recognizes that the research isn’t representative of the situation across the country, but thinks it still constitutes a significant snapshot of LGBTQ experiences. “What we have seen since November is that more and more people report for the first time and people are expressing more fears,” she says.

The NCAVP report also highlighted failures on behalf of the authorities in dealing with reports of violence. In 2016, 41 percent of survivors interacted with law enforcement as a result of the violence that they experienced and, of those, 35 percent of them found police to be indifferent and 31 percent said they were hostile.

Some people reported instances of police misconduct following the reports, including excessive force, unjustified arrest, entrapment, and raids. According to the NCAVP, black people who reported violence were 2.8 times more likely to experience excessive force from police than survivors who did not identify as black.

“LGBTQ communities cannot solely rely on hate crimes legislation and the criminal legal system, as this system is a source of violence for many communities,” the report said.

According to Waters, the first conviction under new hate crime laws—which were introduced during the administration of President Barack Obama—was a symbolic victory for the LGTBQ community. However, the law is limited in its remit as it is tied to a functioning law enforcement system and does not prevent discrimination in the workplace or in education.

The NCAVP advocated for more resources to community services that provide support and healing services can anyone can access outside of the law enforcement system. Just as important is giving visibility to positive and affirming LGBTQ experiences. “While we recognize that violence against LGBTQ people is a pervasive reality, it does not define us,” Waters says. “We [should] continue to actually push forward those more positive, complex and holistic images of LGBTQ people because that is how we humanize people. That is how other people learn about different experiences and how they can start challenging those biases they have.”",1
"STAFFORD, CT — A Vernon man is facing several charges for allegedly stealing heavy duty commercial batteries from a building in Stafford owned by a Newington contractor. The contractor stores equipment for his excavation company at a building he owns on Hydeville Road in Stafford and in September, then man noticed some concrete had been dug into to open a door, according to an arrest warrant. The contractor noticed that 15 commercial batteries valued at $2,625 were missing and the damage to the door was abut $3,000, according to an arrest warrant.

"I was 86 pounds in high school. So in 7th grade, I was probably 65 or 70. Small. Wittle.

But I grew up in the projects of Boston, so I was no stranger to mean kids and ass whippings on the playground. I went to elementary school in Roxbury, south of Southie. My earliest childhood memory is an attack I received out in the projects. A kid randomly grabbed a hypodermic needle off the ground and stabbed me in the back with it. My mother was outside and he attacked me right in front of her. I was 5 years old.

My dad, who was Irish, had left when I was 2 and my mom was a tough Puerto Rican who would tell me to simply punch the bullies in their faces. I tried this. Once. This angered a particular bully who would torment me or destroy my comic books and my school books and break my pencils. He slapped me in the back of the head, so I hit him back. I was too scared to punch him in the face, and he was tall, so I think I got him in the shoulder.

Being the only white kid in the projects probably made me a target. Being small and shy made me an easy one.

He beat me up good that day. I was bleeding from my nose and mouth and he dragged me by my head to a rock on the ground and started hitting my head on the rock. I remember losing my shoe and he threw it on the roof of a building. He had to stop; we were on our way to school and had to catch the bus. He warned me if I told anybody that he had beaten me, he would kill me.

I was scared and actually believed him. I was 10, and the way he beat me, I thought he was capable and willing to kill me. I got up and threw up, maybe my first concussion? I don’t know, but I was bloody. Being the only white kid in the projects probably made me a target. Being small and shy made me an easy one.

Once Whitey Bulger pulled some kids off me. The guy he was with kept saying, “You can’t let these niggers do this to ya!” I remember Whitey said, “Hey!” Told his muscle to cool it. Whitey never cussed or was racial. He asked me my name and who my parents were. Guess he knew who my father was because he called me “little Dave,” dad being “Dave.” Bulger didn’t use racial slurs; he simply said, “You gotta stand up for yourself, and you need to find better friends to play with.”

But I couldn’t hate Black kids for beating me up because some Black kids rescued me on more than one occasion. Once, a very popular dark-skinned girl, Trina, stood up for me. A kid punched me right in the face, blood pouring out of my nose. He loved it and hit me again, stuff was everywhere, all over my clothes, on him. She physically got in between us. He shoved her, and she shoved back. She was amazing and strong and always dressed nice. She had some older brothers, John-John and Jay-Jay, which is probably why she was tough and probably why he backed down.

I tried to go home, but she held my hand on the bus all the way to school. She gave me a hug and I wiped my nose with notebook paper. She took me to a teacher and told her what happened. Someone on the bus said I was her boyfriend, and she whacked them too.

My aunt married a military man who got stationed in North Carolina. We went there one summer to visit and my mom also met a guy, so we ended up moving to North Carolina less than a year later. From the projects of Boston, where they kicked my ass, to the trailer parks of North Carolina, where I soon discovered they’d kick my ass too.

One day I was out playing basketball in the trailer park when a rat-tailed sporting guy nicknamed “Queer Bill” made a comment. I was short and kids were teasing me. He said, “Don’t let them bug you, Dave. You’ll grow, and if you keep playing with it, it’ll grow!”

Everybody laughed. Girls laughed. And pointed. I don’t know how much I actually “played with myself,” and I’d be totally unashamed about something like this now, but at 12? I was mortified. And sick of it.

Bill had bragged that he was going out of town that weekend to Florida. He had also bragged about his belongings, stereo, whatever.

So I talked some neighborhood boys into looking out for me, and we broke into his trailer. I was so full of rage, I couldn’t steal nada. I was just breaking stuff. I did get cases of tapes — AC/DC, Ozzy, Dio, over 100 — and gave them out to the neighborhood.

Worst was probably his waterbed. I stabbed it like I wanted to stab him. There was a quarter-inch of water on the floor, and I broke his stereo, his mirrors. Everything. A few days later, I saw police at his house. He was on his porch, crying.

I felt bad. Then I heard him say, “Why would anyone do this?” I knew then it was useless to get revenge unless you made sure they knew the who, what and why. I can’t believe I didn’t get caught because of the tapes I handed out. But I didn’t. I would later, as an adult, do porno films to erase the notion that I had a little penis because I was a little guy. I wrestled, boxed, took karate. And I have fought mixed martial arts (MMA) professionally to erase the notion that my ass was going to be easy to kick anymore too.

But I’m sorry, Bill. Not for fucking up your shit and robbing you. But back then my mentality was “I’m so low, even the gay guy’s cracking on me,” and that’s what I’m most apologetic for. Prejudice is terrible, and this motivated the severity of my attack, and it sucks and I suck for yielding to it.",1

WASHINGTON — The number of hate crimes committed in the U.S. rose 5 percent in 2016, compared to the year before, according to data gathered from local law enforcement agencies by the FBI.

Of the 6,063 incidents involving 7,509 victims, nearly 60 percent involved people targeted because of their race, with crimes against African-Americans by far the largest share in that segment. About 20 percent of the victims were singled out because of religious bias, and most of them were anti-Jewish attacks. Muslims were the second most likely to be targeted in that category.

Of the 17 percent targeted because of sexual orientation bias, most of the victims were gay men. Less than 1 percent of the victims were targeted over gender identity bias, and nearly all of them were transgender.

Hate crimes can and do happen just about anywhere, the FBI said in releasing the data.

The largest share of crimes against individuals involved intimidation. About 19 percent of the total involved aggravated assault.

Its deeply disturbing to see hate crimes increase for the second year in a row, said Jonathan Greenblatt, national director and CEO of the Anti-Defamation League. They not only hurt one victim, but they also intimidate and isolate a victims whole community and weaken the bonds of our society.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the task force he appointed on crime reduction is exploring ways to revise training for police and prosecutors, and to improve data collection on hate crimes.

No person should have to fear being violently attacked because of who they are, what they believe or how they worship, he said.

An unrelated report released in February found the number of hate groups in the U.S. rose for a second straight year in 2016.

While there is no data linking hate groups to hate crimes, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) said in its annual census that the overall number of hate groups and extremist organizations grew by 35 in a year — to 917 in 2016, from 892 in 2015. And the number of anti-Muslim groups nearly tripled, to 101 last year, from 34 in 2015, the SPLC said.

The law center and other watchdog groups have blamed the spike in extremist groups and hate speech to the divisive presidential election last year. Amid a wave of bomb threats against Jewish centers in March, the SPLC said the heated campaign had fueled an increase in the use of slurs and other derogatory language across the U.S.",1
"Gay ‘Catfish’ Speaks Out: ‘It’s Like a Last Hope That Maybe Someone Will Still Love Me’ – WATCH

Brooklyn rapper Mousey Baby has been charged with a hate crime after he verbally abused and slashed two men because he thought they were gay. It is alleged that in May last year, Mousey Baby – aka James Thomas – barged into a Crown Fried Chicken branch on Fulton Street and started hurling abuse at a number of men who had recently left nearby gay venue the Langston Club.

23-year-old Thomas is accused of slashing one restaurant customer across the face. He then fled the scene but ran into two other men leaving the Langston Club, reports the New York Post.

Thomas pushed one of the men down, pulled out a knife and stabbed the third man twice in the torso and once in the shoulder, according to prosecutors.

Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez said:

“In Brooklyn, everyone, regardless of their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender or religion must be able to safely walk the streets without fear of being senselessly attacked.”

He added that the incident was “particularly egregious as he attacked three innocent people simply because he perceived them to be gay.

According to DNA Info, Thomas turned himself in after security footage of the crime was released. Currently being held at Rikers Island on $150,000 bail he faces up to 25 years in jail.

"On Sunday, Jan. 25, two users added hateful and vulgar comments to a myUMBC post by The Retriever describing the increase of on-campus hate crimes at the end of 2017.

A myUMBC user named Samuel Dadds added a rhyming comment to the post, with the final line reading “Heil Hitler,” accompanied by two swastikas. Below, he wrote, “Hate crime or comedy with an unexpected punchline?” As of this writing, the comments has two likes, or “paws.”

When asked what his motivation was for writing the comment, Dadds responded, “I thought the motivation was quite clear. Hopefully you will include the entire comment in your article so your readers can see it.”

The Retriever staff reached out to Deputy Chief of Police, Paul Dillon, for assistance. According to an email to The Retriever, Dillon will consult with the Office of the General Counsel to determine if the comment is considered protected speech.

The post was originally published on Dec. 14 . It was the last post from The Retriever of the fall semester, but it is unclear why new comments were added over a month later. This afternoon, Dadds also responded to a comment on the same post that was posted over three weeks ago.

Another user also revisited the post. Bill Houghton, referencing swastikas on campus, wrote, “The people drawing them are probably Jewish. Most Jewish people I know get a kick out of them.”

When asked for clarification, Houghton explained that use of swastikas are often for shock factor rather than hateful intentions, noting that it depends on the context. Houghton claimed that characterizing swastikas, particularly those used “in many groups of non-pc alternatively funny people” as hate crimes is inaccurate: “the random symbol for most middle class college students isn’t going to elicit connotations associated with anti-jew.”

“Now, many of my friends are Jewish and actively make jokes about the fact. None I know face prejeduce or injustice. Many Jewish kids I know are very aware of the stigmatized swastika and while they might see it as offensive in obviously offensive contexts, most would see it on a white board and laugh, and a couple would be the ones to draw it out of irony.”",1
"Michael J. Agresta, 40, of Highland Heights, was arrested in Bath over the weekend after allegedly conning several area gas stations out of hundreds of dollars. According to Bath Township Police Chief Michael McNeely, Agresta would pull up to gas stations in a snowplow truck, show fake invoices to clerks and demand payment for work he never completed. When Agresta attempted the scam at a True North Shell station on Sunday evening, the attendant grew suspicious and alerted Bath poilce. Agresta was charged with attempted theft, a second-degree misdemeanor, and was handed over to Solon Police, which issued a warrant for his arrest on Jan. 30. The warrant stemmed from a Jan 27 incident allegedly involving Agresta and a True North Shell station employee in Solon. According to Solon police, Agresta badgered the employee until he was paid $80. Agresta is being held in Solon Jail, and will be sent back to Bath once Solons courts are done prosecuting him on theft charges. Agresta also has outstanding warrants in Lakewood on attempted theft and theft charges. Snowplow scams have been reported in Lakewood, but its not yet clear whether Agresta was connected to them. Lakewood Police Chief Timothy Malley couldnt be reached for comment on Tuesday.",0
"WOBURN, MA -- A 36-year-old Woburn man with two prior arrests for lewdness was arrested by Woburn Police on Sunday after patrons of the Red Roof Inn allegedly saw him naked and committing a lewd act in the picture window of his fifth-floor hotel room. In Woburn District Court on Monday, Francis Nestico, 36, of Woburn, had his bail set at $1,000 cash after pleading not guilty to three counts of open and gross lewdness. If he posts bail, Judge Timothy Gailey ordered that Nestico stay away from the Red Roof Inn in Woburn and have no contact with the alleged victims. Prosecutors explained that at around 9 p.m. on May 14, a man and woman, patrons of the hotel, saw a naked man standing at his window in his fifth-floor room committing a lewd act. While it was dark outside, the man had his room lights on so he was visible, prosecutors allege. When the suspect allegedly looked directly at the woman, she gave him an obscene gesture, and he placed a shirt over his face and continued his lewd conduct, prosecutors allege. Hotel staff also noted Nesticos behavior, the prosecutor said. Prosecutors sought $2,500 cash bail, noting Nestico has two prior convictions for the same conduct in February 2016. In one case, a woman looked out her bedroom window and saw Nestico standing naked in his bedroom window and committing a lewd act while looking at her. In the second case, he was convicted of breaking and entering and open and gross lewdness after he was caught committing a lewd act in the kitchen of his downstairs neighbor, prosecutors said. Nesticos next court date is June 9. Photo by Lisa Redmond/lisa.redmond@patch.com.",0
"Editors note: This article was originally published earlier this week. ASHBURN, VA — A Herndon man has been arrested after police say he sprayed a group of middle school children walking home from school on the Washington and Old Dominion Trail in Ashburn with pepper spray as he rode past on his bicycle. Police were called to the 44200 block of Gloucester Parkway at around 4:05 p.m. on Aug. 31 to a report of an assault on the W&OD Trail, according to a report from the Loudoun County Sheriffs Office. Police say a group of middle school-aged children were walking on the trail when a cyclist approached and reportedly was holding a can in his hand, the report states. As the cyclist passed, he sprayed what the juveniles believed to be pepper spray in the direction of several of the children, the report continues. Deputies located the cyclist in the area of the W&OD trail and Ruritan Circle. Police arrested 47-year-old Marcos A. Catalan of Herndon on charges of malicious injury by use of caustic substance (two counts) and attempted malicious injury by caustic substance. Two girls were taken to the hospital for treatment, and are expected to recover fully, the report states. Catalan is being held without bond at the Loudoun County Adult Detention Center.

"BOSTON – Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker signed an Executive Order re-establishing the Governor’s Task Force on Hate Crimes and was joined by Secretary of Public Safety and Security Daniel Bennett to swear-in members of the commission.

The Task Force will advise the Governor on issues relating to the prevalence, deterrence and prevention of hate crimes in the Commonwealth and the support of victims of hate crimes.

“Our administration is committed to making Massachusetts a safe and welcoming place with zero-tolerance for hate or violence,” said Governor Charlie Baker. “We look forward to working with this diverse group of qualified members who represent different backgrounds and parts of our state to enhance our commitment to inclusive and tolerant communities.”

Members of the Task Force include gubernatorial appointees with expertise in community advocacy, law enforcement, health care, law, government and education and represent a group diverse in gender, race, industry, region, age and education. Secretary of Public Safety and Security Daniel Bennett and CEO and President of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Boston Josh Kraft will serve as co-chairs.

“The Commonwealth is comprised of 351 cities and towns with diverse populations that proudly celebrate their diversity,” said Lt. Governor Polito. “I thank the members of this Task Force for their commitment and willingness to serve the Commonwealth and help all our residents feel safe from hate and violence.”

This task force will meet at least quarterly and submit a formal written report annually that addresses the mission of the Task Force, targeted objectives, options and recommended actions and metrics to measure the effects of the recommendations on hate crimes in Massachusetts to the Governor.

The Task Force will promote full and effective coordination among law enforcement agencies in order to improve prevention, investigation and prosecution of hate crimes. The Task Force will encourage and assist agencies in safe reporting of hate crimes pursuant to the Hate Crime Reporting Act, as well as analyze and publicize hate crime reports pursuant to the Hate Crime Penalties Act. This group will develop best practices related to technical assistance for school districts that may seek to incorporate hate crime education into their curricula.

In 1991, Governor Bill Weld initiated the Governor’s Task Force on Hate Crimes by letter, coordinating and giving priority to state implementation of the Hate Crimes Reporting Act. From 1994 to 1996, the Task Force led the successful legislative effort to amend the Hate Crimes Penalties Act to expand its scope and increase penalties for those who commit hate crimes. In 1997, Governor Paul Cellucci formalized the Task Force through Executive Order 401. The reconstitution of the Task Force reinvigorates the Commonwealth’s statewide commitment to fighting hate crimes and supporting victims and impacted communities.

"As rights advocates continue to denounce how President Donald Trump has emboldened intolerant ideology, newly obtained data shows that the number of hate crimes rose nationally in 2016, with figures from this year pointing to a troubling trend.

The data looking at crimes motivated by racism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, Islamophobia, or other anti-otherness comes from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino and was obtained by the Huffington Post.

The findings from Professor Brian Levin, director of the center, show that from 2015 to 2016, there was a five-percent uptick in hate crimes; that follows a 7-percent rise from 2014 to 2015. If these moderate overall increases of 5 percent hold nationally for 2016, Levin told HuffPo, this will be the first time since 2004 that the nation has experienced consecutive annual increases in hate crime.

Levins assessment is based on two data sets, one from law enforcement agencies in 31 large cities and counties which found 2,101 hate crimes in 2016. The second is from 13 states and showed 3,887 hate crimes during the year, mirroring the rise indicated in the first set.

Four of the nations five biggest cities—Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia—had double-digit increases. For Washington, D.C., the increase was a whopping 62 percent. Another notable finding, writes reporter Christopher Mathias, is that of the seven cities that broke down anti-Muslim hate crimes in 2016, six saw increases in that category.

The official FBI hate crime statistics, which are released in November, normally show an uptick in presidential election years, Mathias notes. But 2016 stood part, Levin told HuffPo, because with the exception of the Midwest―and particularly among the largest jurisdictions with the best data, [there] was a clear and dramatic spike for the election period that was unlike anything I can recall in my professional career.

Among the examples noted by Mathias is Philadelphia, which counted seven hate crimes in November, compared to only one over the previous four Novembers combined.

2017 appears to be on track to be another year with an increase in hate crimes. Levin said that official police hate crime data from 13 large cities shows an almost 20 percent rise compared to 2016.

As Mathias colleague Samantha Store said on Twitter, The data backs up alarming anecdotal evidence of emboldened bigotry in America.

The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) last year documented 867 bias-related incidents in the 10 days following the presidential election, calling it a national outbreak of hate, and the predictable result of the campaign [Trump] waged, while Amnesty International said 2016 was the year that the cynical use of us vs. them narratives of blame, hate, and fear took on a global prominence to a level not seen since the 1930s. The human rights group also said Trump was among world leaders who are wielding a toxic agenda that hounds, scapegoats, and dehumanizes entire groups of people.

But the full scope of hate crimes in the U.S. in any given year is unclear, as not all figures are turned over to the FBI. Seeking to address that problem, the Documenting Hate project, led by ProPublica and launched in the wake of Trumps election, offers a database of hate crimes and a tool for victims or witnesses to such a crime to document the incident.",1

"The 22-year-old man charged for killing a black Bowie State University student will not face hate crime charges due to lack of evidence. Sean Christopher Urbanski, a student at the University of Maryland, was indicted for murder on Thursday (July 13) in the May slaying of 23-year-old Richard Collins III.

READ: FBI Probing Murder Of Bowie University Student Is A Possible Hate Crime

Despite the FBI initially investigating the case as a hate crime, state prosecutors “didn’t have enough” evidence to go forward with the charges. The murder has since been described as an unprovoked attack.

“Developing a motive is always a challenging aspect of a case, and in this case, and in any other case, you can’t get it wrong,” Prince George’s County State’s Attorney Angela Alsobrooks said at a press conference on Thursday.

Meanwhile, UMD has had a string of well-publicized incidents of racism. Less than a week before Collins was killed, a noose was discovered in the kitchen of a Phi Kappa Tau fraternity house, and in March, fliers were placed around campus declaring America a “white nation.”

Urbanksi, who belonged to a white supremacist Facebook group known a “Alt-Reigh Nation,” could still potentially be charged with a hate crime at a later date.

A grand jury moved to indict Urbanksi for murder after reviewing evidence that included video surveillance taken at the bus stop where Collins was stabbed to death in the early hours of May 20.

Collins and two friends were waiting for an Uber on campus when Urbanksi approached and threatened, “Step left if you know what’s best for you.”

Collins, an ROTC member and recently commissioned second lieutenant in the Army, refused to move and was fatally stabbed in the chest. He died at a local hospital, days before he was scheduled to graduate from Bowie State, a historically black college.

Following the murder, Welby Burgone, a Maryland civilian police employee and Urbanski’s former classmate, was suspended from his job for posting a Facebook message showing support for the brutal act.

Another of Urbanski’s classmates apparently commented on Brugone’s post, “F*ck yeah Sean!!! That’s what happens when a n*gger tries to get frosty with an OG.”

A trial date has not yet been set for Urbanksi, who faces life in prison, if convicted.

"Delaware police charged a man with committing a hate crime after he spied on and threatened to firebomb his neighbors, who he suspected were Muslim.

Gerard Medvec told authorities that, after spying on his neighbors, he suspected they were Muslim and that he intended to “take the fight to them,” according to Delaware Online.

Delaware City Police Chief David Baylor confirmed that Medvec’s neighbors are not Muslim, but Medvec concluded that they were based on using binoculars to observe one of them, a black male, who Medvec thought was wearing a “Muslim hat.”

Court documents show that Medvec met with authorities earlier in Oct. to express his concerns, according to the Associated Press, and told them he “seriously thought about throwing some Molotov cocktails” at his neighbors’ house.

“For someone to draw an opinion of people just based on the color of their skin is obviously disturbing,” Baylor told Delaware Online. “That he threatened to take possible action is very alarming.”

Medvec initially met with Baylor on Oct. 5 and told him that he feared Muslims were infiltrating the U.S. in order to overrun it. He then made a 911 call on Oct. 14 and mentioned a threat on his life that he had previously reported. Police checked on Medvec at his house and took note of some binoculars that he left on a windowsill. He then told them about that man with the “Muslim hat.”

State Police’s Mobile Crisis Unit sent a psychiatric social worker to Medvec’s home Oct. 17. He agreed to meet with the Mobile Crisis Team. Authorities noted two semi-automatic rifles, one with a taped magazine, in the house. Medvec also removed a pistol from his waistband before leaving his home to meet with the Mobile Crisis Team.

Authorities arrested Medvec Oct. 20 and charged him with a hate crime, as per a conversation with the Delaware Attorney General’s Office. A judge released on $4,000 bail and ordered him to hand over all of his firearms and to have no contact with the neighbors whom he threatened to firebomb.

EUGENE, Ore. -- A report released by The City of Eugene, Human Rights and Neighborhood Involvement, says there were 82 hate and bias incidents in 2016.

This marked an increase from last year’s report, which showed 59 hate and bias incidents.

The numbers are not an accurate reflection of how many hate crimes happen in Eugene, according to Jennifer Lleras Van Der Haeghen, the program manager for Human Rights and Neighborhood Involvement.

People in our community are experiencing hate and bias crime and incidents at levels that I dont think most folks in our community understand.

Multiple hate and bias crimes go under-reported to law enforcement, she said.

“According to the Department of Justice, only 25% and 42% of hate and bias crimes are reported at a federal level,” says Van Der Haeghen.

The City of Eugene and HRNI have partnered with multiple community organizations to be the bridge of trust between the community and law enforcement.

“Families come to us because we are a trusted entity; they come to us and they say, I have been discriminated, or any other issue,” says Juan Carlos Valle, State Director for Oregon League of Latin American Citizens.

Valles, has personally been a victim of hate and bias incidents. He says he hears multiple stories all the time from families being victims of hate and bias incidents.

Another one is a school, a local school in which kids were being called names. They were shouting the name Trump and asking them for their papers. These kids are US-born citizens,” said Valles.

According to the 2016 report, 54 % of all hate crimes reported to Eugene Police Department were based on race.

“This report only captures data that is collected by the Eugene Police Department, and does not include hate crimes that include the university because the university has their own police department, as does Springfield,” says Van Der Haeghen

The 2016 report divides these incidents into two categories. 44 cases come under the criminal category while 38 are considered non-criminal.” In those cases, the incidents fall under free speech or the victims chose not to file a police report.

"Mindy Kaling regularly posts jokes and spotlights cool art on her Facebook page, but her latest post is a departure from her usual—and for an important reason.

“Nabra Hassanen, I wont forget you and what happened to you,” she wrote next to a photo of a beaming young woman. “Another innocent Muslim person targeted for their faith. Please read about her if you can.”

Mindy is referring to the death of Muslim teenager Nabra Hassanen, who was allegedly sexually assaulted and murdered after leaving a mosque in Virginia with her friends, according to the Washington Post. She was just 17. While law enforcement did not name the victim, relatives of Nabra and her mosque, the All Dulles Area Muslim Society (ADAMS), have revealed her identity.

A suspect named Darwin Torres, 22, has been arrested and charged with murder, according to the Washington Post. According to People, the police said in a statement that Nabra and her friends slept over at the mosque, then went to a McDonalds early in the morning. Nabra became separated from her friends after they allegedly got into a dispute with Darwin. Her friends ran back to the mosque and reported what happened, while Darwin allegedly attacked and killed Nabra. Remains of a body that police believe to be Nabras were found later on Sunday in a pond in Sterling, Virginia.

“We are devastated and heartbroken as our community undergoes and processes this traumatic event,” ADAMS said in a statement. “It is a time for us to come together to pray and care for our youth.”

While Nabras death is currently not being investigated as a hate crime, many, like Mindy, are speculating that this is another sad example of a Muslim person facing violence due to their religion. According to a report from the Council on American-Islamic Relations, anti-Muslim bias incidents increased 65 percent between 2014 and 2016 in the United States. And just this past weekend there was a deadly attack outside of a London mosque early Sunday morning, when a man drove a van into a crowd of people leaving midnight Ramadan prayers. According to CBS News, witnesses and law enforcement say the suspect was shouting that he wanted to kill more Muslims. The crime, which left one person dead and injured at least eight others, is being treated as a terrorist attack.

"JACKSON-Today, the Jackson Township Police Department reported a depiction of a swastika and penis dragged into mulch at the township-owned Woodlane Park and Mayor Michael Reina condemned the incident.

“The Township of Jackson condemns the anti-semitic message that appeared recently in Woodlane Park,” Reina wrote in a press release. “The drawing of a swastika in the ground is shocking and unacceptable. Jackson Township will treat this as a hate crime and when found, the perpetrators will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Police Chief Matthew Kunz confirmed the incident and provided more details.

“We have had a recent upswing in juvenile mischief in the park, to which we have responded by increasing patrols in the area,” Kunz said. “A report was made to the police department regarding an image “dragged” into the mulch, but upon arrival of our officer, the image was gone, as well as was the reporting party. Another parent was determined to have also observed and covered the images, along with the reporting party, without remaining on scene and talking to our officer.”

Kunz said the original caller, and the other parent, may have distributed the photographs, although the images were already removed prior to police arrival.

He added, that a follow-up with the reporting party this morning confirmed that the reporting party removed the images from the mulch prior to police arrival.

“The Jackson Township community will not be intimidated by such acts of hate.” Jackson Mayor Michael Reina said in the release. “We do not condone this behavior and it will not be tolerated. We accept everyone into our community and any message of hate is taken very seriously. I encourage anyone with information to come forward.”

"PayPal escalates techs war on white supremacy

JERRY JACKSON/BALTIMORE SUN

Posted Wednesday, August 16, 2017 3:21 pm

PayPal, the popular online payment platform, announced late Tuesday night that it would bar users from accepting donations to promote hate, violence and intolerance following revelations that the company played a key role in raising money for a white supremacist rally that turned deadly.



The company, in a lengthy blog post, outlined its longstanding policy of not allowing its services to be used to accept payments or donations to organizations that advocate racist views. PayPal singled out the KKK, white supremacist groups or Nazi groups — all three of whom were involved in organizing last weekends Charlottesville rally.



Intolerance can take on a range of on-line and off-line forms, across a wide array of content and language, the company wrote. It is with this backdrop that PayPal strives to navigate the balance between freedom of expression and open dialogue - and the limiting and closing of sites that accept payments or raise funds to promote hate, violence and intolerance.



Corporate watchdogs and civil rights organizations have pressured the company for years to ban such groups - to little avail.



For the longest time, PayPal has essentially been the banking system for white nationalism, Keegan Hankes, analyst for the Southern Poverty Law Center, told The Washington Post. Its a shame it took Charlottesville for them to take it seriously.



While PayPal has at times prevented some prominent hate groups from raising money through its platform, it also allowed at least eight groups and individuals openly espousing racist views to move money through its site before and after Charlottesville, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a legal advocacy organization that monitors hate groups.



 PayPal, one of the worlds largest online payment processors, was integral in raising money to orchestrate the event, the Southern Poverty Law Center posted on its Hatewatch blog Tuesday, just hours before PayPal publicly banned such groups. Organizers, speakers, and individual attendees relied on the platform to move funds in the run up to the ultimately deadly event.



The Unite the Right march in Charlottesville ended with one person dead and 19 injured after a car driven by an alleged Nazi sympathizer crashed into a crowd of activists protesting the hate rally. Two other state troopers were killed when their helicopter monitoring the demonstrations crashed.



LONG OVERDUE



PayPals decision to kick nearly three dozen hate groups off its platform is long overdue, Hankes said. He said his center has been lobbying the company for more than two years to take action against the groups, providing extensive lists and dossiers about them.



After a white supremacist killed nine black worshipers in a Charleston church in 2015, PayPal banned the Council of Conservative Citizens, a white supremacist group that the helped inspire the attack. But the current purge is of an unprecedented scale, activists say.



Our understanding is that this is just whats the first to come, and that they are taking a hard stance, Hankes said.



PayPal has agreed to removed at least 34 organizations, including Richard Spencers National Policy Institute, two companies that sell gun accessories explicitly for killing Muslims, as well as all accounts associated with Jason Kessler, the white nationalist blogger who organized the Charlottesville march, according to a list provided to the Post by Color of Change, a racial justice organization seeking to influence corporate decision makers.



Color of Change has been in private conversations with PayPal leaders since February to ban racist groups for using the platform to raise money. The organization spoke with PayPal representatives Tuesday afternoon and was given a list of hate groups to be banned.



Once the events of Charlottesville happened, we gave all the companies we had been talking to a final warning that we were going to be moving this campaign forward, said Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change. Enough talking, cajoling and educating. This is not a question of policy. Its a question of practice, and whether or not these companies are willing to actually put their values and policies into practice.

The stage beneath the blue-and-white church steeple in Maryland was not where Richard Collins III was to be celebrated this week.

The young lieutenant, who had just been commissioned in the U.S. Army last week, should have marched across the stage at Bowie State University’s graduation ceremony Tuesday to claim his diploma, in mortarboard and flowing black robe.

Richard Collins III (Reuters)

Instead, hundreds of students, family, friends and fellow soldiers gathered Friday morning at the First Baptist Church of Glenarden to honor the young man who was fatally stabbed in College Park at the University of Maryland.

The 23-year-old’s death — now being investigated by the FBI as a possible hate crime — baffled and devastated both campuses at a moment of heightened racial tension in America. The seemingly random killing at the threshold of Collins’s military career drew condemnation from lawmakers around the state and an immediate promise from the University Maryland to launch a comprehensive plan intended to “combat hate.”

Pauletta Handy, a 53-year-old Bowie resident and mother of a Maryland graduate, didn’t know Collins, but she felt like she did.

“I’m a black mother,” she said at the church, her eyes glassy. “To have a good kid like that, somebody who wanted to serve our country, and for him to get taken out not in Iraq but right here in our own country over racism.”

Collins’s body arrived just before 8 a.m in a black hearse bearing the seal of the U.S. Army. White-gloved comrades in their dress blues quietly marched Collins’s casket into the church as four others stood at the entrance in silent salute.

Wearing dark sunglasses, Collins’s mother clutched a handkerchief as she accepted hugs and condolences from friends, uniformed service members, politicians and police.

The service was joyful at points, with cheers, applause and chants of hallelujah from the crowd.

“Our pain, our grief, our suffering is very, very deep,” said Pastor Steve Pierce. “Let us work together for peace and justice.”

The funeral comes six days after Collins was killed in what police said was a “totally unprovoked” attack while at a bus stop with two friends on the University of Maryland campus in College Park. Collins was visiting the campus when police say Sean Christopher Urbanski, a U-Md. student, approached the group at about 3 a.m. Saturday and told Collins to move. Collins refused before Urbanski stabbed him in the chest, police said.

Urbanski, 22, of Severna Park, Md., has been charged with first- and second-degree murder and first-degree assault. Urbanski’s attorney has said that drugs and alcohol may have played a role in the case.

Prince George’s County police picked up Urbanski about 50 feet from where Collins had collapsed, court papers state. Police recovered a knife from Urbanski’s front-right pocket, police said. He remains jailed on a no-bond status.

The attack rattled both universities, which have been in the middle of spring graduation celebrations. Collins’s slaying has stoked fear and concern among students and administrators at the College Park campus, where racially motivated incidents already had unsettled the community in recent months.

Sean Christopher Urbanski (Reuters)

Collins was black, and Urbanski is white. Although police initially said the attack did not seem to be racially motivated, authorities announced Sunday that they had launched a hate-crime investigation after they said they learned Urbanski appeared to have some involvement with a social media page called “Alt-Reich: Nation.”

“We’re not supposed to be here,” the Rev. Darryl L. Godlock said before the funeral service, insisting that people “stop hating one another, stop attacking one another.”

On Wednesday, U-Md. President Wallace D. Loh announced “an action plan to combat hate and create a safer campus.” The plan includes dedicating $100,000 for diversity and inclusion programs and the creation of a “trained, rapid-response team” offering services to the community hate-bias incidents.

“How could this happen to a young man with so much promise?” Prince George’s County Executive Rushern L. Baker III wrote in a letter that was read during the service. He quoted John 15:13: “There is no greater love than to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.”

Baker added that he hoped Collins’s “sacrifice inspires us all to drive out hatred, racism, and intolerance within our communities.”

The audience — which included U.S. Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen and Former NAACP president Ben Jealous — interrupted the reading with standing applause.

One speaker suggested that Collins was standing up against bigotry the night of the stabbing.

“When he said, ‘No,’ he said, ‘This war is not going to be one that I’m going to lose,’” said Artie L. Travis, the vice president of student affairs at Bowie.

Travis said he longed for a day when he would not have to look over his shoulder in fear, simply because he was a black man, a comment that resonated with Vicky Bruce.

“That’s something I’ve never had to feel as a white person,” said Bruce, who lives in the community where Urbanski resides.

Bruce, 50, didn’t know Collins but attended the funeral along with women from Anne Arundel County Indivisible. In Collins’s honor the organization is pushing anti-hate legislation in the county, where a noose was recently found hanging outside of a middle school.

“If you let these racist groups survive and fester, it’s like a cancer in our society,” said Bruce.

[Visiting student killed in stabbing attack at University of Maryland]

Throughout the services, Collins’s family, commanding officers and colleagues spoke fondly of the young man who loved lacrosse and soccer, who helped a relative build a robot for an engineering class and who wanted to serve in the military to follow the footsteps of his father and grandfather.

Major Gen. Christopher Hughes, head of the U.S. Army’s Cadet Command, said Collins kept the highest academic and physical test scores among his class while also encouraging other colleagues to succeed.

Collins would pick up fellow cadets from the Metro station in the morning so they could make their physical fitness tests.

“He helped his fellow cadets reach their dreams and their goals, and I gotta tell you, that is pretty lofty for a man of a mere 23 years of age,” Hughes said.

Collins’s cousins described him as a fiercely opinionated person who was always eager to defend his beliefs. They shared stories of their mischief, including the time he cut a younger cousin’s hair. “He was the fun coordinator,” his oldest cousin, Kristal Godfrey, said, but he was also the preacher when they “played church.”

Godfrey told the gathered crowd to honor her cousin’s memory with love, remarks that drew swelling applause.

“I want to challenge you to love,” she said. “Not the hippie kind of love. I’m talking about that fierce, unrelenting love. . . A love that stands up for what is right. . . that does not allow hate to persist.”

Services ended Friday with Collins’s mother accepting an American flag on her son’s behalf, in a gesture akin to her husband’s days earlier when he had walked across the stage at Bowie State’s graduation to accept their Richie’s diploma.

"A teenage girl fell victim to a racial attack as a classmate abused and spat on her.

In yet another example of racisms reach, a 16-year-old girl was allegedly spat upon and was abused by her classmate in New York City. The boy even tried to rip off her hijab.

The incident took place in High School for Law Enforcement and Public Safety. A 15-year-old boy was on an elevator with the girl when he called the victim “a Muslim b****,” spit on her and then tugged on her hijab in an attempt to rip it off her head.

The girl reported the attack to school officials, who called the police. The teen was then questioned and was later charged with aggravated harassment and disorderly conduct.

The boy’s name was not released by the police as he will be charged as a juvenile. Police also confirmed that the girl was not physically injured.

“This incident is troubling, and this type of behavior has no place in our schools. We are providing the school with additional support to ensure appropriate follow-up action is taken,” said Department of Education spokeswoman Toya Holness.

Ever since President Donald Trump assumed office, there has been a spike in hate-related incidents, especially targeted at Muslims. Kids arent even safe in school anymore. A similar incident took place at a New York Elementary School when a second-grader suffered minor injuries to her eye after her teacher allegedly ripped off her hijab as punishment for “misbehaving” in classroom.

Recently, a Muslim woman in line at a Trader Joe’s store in Reston, Virginia, became a target of racism when a woman decided to attack her with slurs and an anti-Obama rant.

Not long ago, a Muslim American family, who were attending a family reunion on South Padre Island, Texas, became victims of a verbal attack by a fellow beachgoer. The white man yelled “f****** Muslim” and also referred to ISIS repeatedly. The man later began screaming about Sharia law, which is derived from both the Quran and fatwas, the rulings of Islamic scholars.

">>News Alerts: Subscribe to a free email newsletter: ANNAPOLIS •EDGEWATER •ODENTON ODENTON, MD — An Odenton contractor who stole and pawned valuable family heirlooms from a customer he threatened, and tried to forge her checks, has been sentenced to 25 years in prison. Jason Tyler Butler was sentenced Tuesday on charges including issuing false documentation, felony theft, and second-degree burglary. A judge also ordered Butler to pay restitution and refused to consider modifying two sentences, one for a period of ten years and the other of 15 years, which he was originally ordered to serve concurrently. Prosecutors say Butler was hired by Leigh Lawson of Odenton to do work on her home. Over about seven months, Butler stole and pawned tens of thousands of dollars worth of Lawsons family heirlooms, which included her grandmothers engagement ring and her fathers wedding band and class ring. Butler also stole checks from Lawson and tried to forge her signature to cash the checks. Butler sold Lawsons property valued at $29,950. The victim told prosecutors that she feared for her well-being, especially when Butler was abusing drugs. Anne Arundel County States Attorney Wes Adams said Wednesday that Butler has continuously violated court orders with seven violations of probation. For 17 years, Mr. Butler has skirted accountability in our criminal justice system, Adams said. Mr. Butler is an example of an everyday criminal who revolves through the court system and threatens the quality of life for our citizens. Lawson thanked Adams office in a statement: I am relieved. I can carry on finally with my life without having to be scared and victimized. I can carry on with my work, my life, and can focus again. The States Attorneys Office is incredibly compassionate, understanding, and eloquent with their words in court - not just that but their professionalism and deep knowledge of the law. … I was embarrassed to even talk about it, but if anyone out there is a victim, they should come forward. Wes Adams office made sure I was comforted along the way. In a second case, Butler stole about $3,000 worth of copper wiring and other items -- including a bathtub, a furnace and a radiator -- from an unoccupied residence in Crownsville.",0
"A recently released research paper shows the age-old adage about saying something nice is true, even in the modern era, and especially with an unconventional president.

University of Warwick researchers Karsten Müller and Carlo Schwarz found evidence that suggests Donald Trump’s tweets about Islam have led to an increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes over the past few years.

Using the FBI’s hate crime database, the pair first took a wide view of any recorded hate crime between 1990 and 2016, before limiting the scope of the search to hate crimes against Muslims after Trump took office. The number of these crimes not only increased under Trump, it’s the highest number in recorded history, including the months following 9/11 under the Bush administration.

The data also showed a strong statistical correlation between the number of Trump’s tweets about Islam, and an uptick in crimes in the days and weeks that followed.

“To be clear, we do not claim that Donald Trump himself causes hate crimes out of thin air,” Carlo Schwarz, a doctoral student who worked on the study, told The Daily Beast. “But what we think is interesting is that Trump’s tweets and hate crime only appear to be correlated after the start of his presidential run. It is also interesting that this correlation seems to be driven by areas with many Twitter users.”

To attempt to make sense of the findings, the researchers then looked for patterns by location. Twitter usage, the study contends, varies wildly by location, even county-by-county or city-by-city.

When analyzing geographic patterns, Müller and Schwarz found the increase in hate crimes mostly occurred in counties with higher Twitter usage, and only after Trump took office. Simply put, this isn’t a general increase in crime, a lack of political or ethnic diversity, or anti-Muslim sentiment in an area.

In fact the areas with the heaviest Twitter use tend to skew liberal and be more ethnically diverse than counties with lower usage. Interestingly, there was no comparable increase in counties with low Twitter usage.

The findings, however, aren’t without limitations. It faces the same shortcomings as any study that proves correlation, but falls short of causal proof. Simply put, it’s worth taking the findings with a grain of salt, a sentiment echoed by the researchers. Müller and Schwarz note that their findings are only consistent with the idea that Trump’s presidency has made it more socially acceptable to express prejudicial or hateful views, not that it’s creating new racists capable of carrying out hate crimes.

And these views, according to the research team, were held long before the 2016 election.

"LAS VEGAS (KTNV) - An elderly couple living near Owens and Mt. Hood says theyre still shaken up after finding hateful graffiti covering their SUV.

They woke up Sunday morning to find offensive messages spray-painted on their car. One said KKK and the other said f*** you b**** and also had a reference to President Donald Trump.

Birdie Sinyard and her husband Jimmy say theyve never had any issues in their neighborhood and have no idea why they would have been targeted.

Theyre especially concerned given the recent events in Charlottesville and dont know why someone would try and associate them with a hate group.

I have nothing to do with the KKK, Sinyard says.

As for the reference to the president, Birdie says she doesnt even support Trump. Her husband Jimmy does, but they never discuss politics amongst themselves, let alone with anyone else.

The incident is being investigated as a hate crime and a crime against the elderly. The Sinyards say since the incidents, theyve had neighbors from all races support them, even helping to scrub off the hateful messages.

But the pain cant be scrubbed away. The incident came as they were already mourning the loss of their 25-year-old grandson.

Their granddaughter, Jewel, says she just wants the suspects caught.

I would like an apology not for me but for my grandparents, they didnt deserve this, she says.

Vincent Randazzese, 52, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to the hate crime charges filed against him. A Monroe County grand jury indicted him on five hate crime-related counts and three misdemeanors.

The judge ordered a new temporary order of protection be filed against Randazzese for the family. That order will last until October 2018.

The victim, who is of Indian descent, said Randazzese walked past him on the canal as the victim was dancing with his children on the pathway, then stopped and started yelling at him, telling him that he has no right to be in this country.

This is my country, you have no f***ing rights here, Randazzese allegedly told the victim, calling him a n***er and a f***ing n***er before telling him to go back to his own country.

The victim then took out his phone to call 911, allegedly prompting Randazzese to pull the phone from the victims hand and throw it into the Erie Canal.



Randazzeses family members tell 13WHAM News that Vincent has a mental illness, saying he has been hospitalized multiple times for it.

The trial is scheduled to begin on February 26, 2018.

"CLOSE Peggy Wallace Kennedy gives her thoughts on new Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey and whats ahead for the state. Brad Harper

When my father’s Alabama National Guard Unit was federalized by President John F. Kennedy for integration of the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa in June 1963, my grandfather stayed with my mom and I in our small home in Chambers County. Grandpa Sam brought his shotgun with him.

Integration of Gov. George C. Wallace’s alma mater was not something he would “allow.” Kennedy ordered Wallace to stay away from the Capstone, but Wallace did not comply. Kennedy feared KKK violence in Tuscaloosa and sent Guardsmen like my dad, a Korean vet, who loved the Army, the Guard and law and order. Though he dropped out of school at age 8 when his father died of pneumonia, dad understood the need for education.

With dad away on Guard duty, my grandfather was on guard duty with mom and I. He guarded us from freelance racists, angry that dad served his country rather than racism. Grandpa Sam played Solitaire, without sleep, until dad returned.

While my grandpa played cards, he chewed tobacco. On the kitchen table were his cards, shotgun, Bible, fresh tobacco and spit can. Late nights when car lights came down our street, Grandpa Sam told mom and I to get in the tub in the bathroom. We had a single police officer in our town and during the segregation days of the 1960s, the poor man was overworked especially at night.

I was 7 and watched my grandpa play cards and chew tobacco. He saw me looking at his gun and his Bible. He told me it wasn’t that we didn’t believe God would protect us from evil. These days God has lots of people to protect, he told me. Our shotgun will protect us until God hears our prayers.

Segregation days and nights were full of evil. Evil in Birmingham on a Sunday morning in September 1963. Evil in Selma on Bloody Sunday. Evil on a dark highway took Viola Liuzzo in 1965. It seemed to a kid evil was everywhere.

In 2017 it must seem to kids, evil is everywhere. Gang violence in many cities. Drug violence, too. Violence against young girls. Violence against kids with disabilities. Violence against LGBT youth. A gay teen at a Bronx high school in New York, reportedly subjected to bullying, recently used a switchblade to kill one of his bullies.

Social media is used by ISIS and other terror groups to radicalize teens and adults across America. San Bernardino, New York, Orlando and maybe Las Vegas. Congress can and must do more to protect Americans. Terrorists use of social media to radicalize Americans to kill other Americans must be stopped by Congress.

Clearly, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Apple’s Tim Cook, Twitter’s Jack Dorsey and others are profit motivated rather than motivated to protect Americans. Cook would not assist the FBI in using Apple’s technology to access information from the iPhone of the San Bernardino killers.

The FBI had to use tax money to hire other technology companies to aid their investigation as to whether information could be obtained from the San Bernardino killer’s Apple iPhone to prevent murders of more Americans. Due to time lost in the FBI investigation, information on other planned ISIS actions in the U.S. and abroad we will never know if lives could have been saved.

Last month, I bought a handgun for protection at my Washington, D.C., residence. I lived here during and after al-Qaeda’s Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the Pentagon. I watched on my office TV as I lost friends at New York’s World Trade Towers.

Our country is out of control with widespread disrespect and hate for police, our history, our flag and the National Anthem. After the U.S. Senate failed to impeach President Bill Clinton for lying under oath about sodomizing White House intern Monica Lewinsky, every crook in Washington is certain they can commit any crime without being held accountable, e.g. former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

After GOP U.S. Congressman Steve Scalise, House Majority leader, was shot in July, Alabama U.S. Senator Luther Strange worked with the National Rifle Association to offer gun training on Capitol Hill. Reason: There are not enough U.S. Capitol Police to safeguard 535 Members of Congress and staffers.

More: Mo Brooks describes shooting at baseball park: Explosions, then a race for cover

Many Members of Congress will confidentially tell you they and their staffers carry guns. Members of Congress are targets for sick, sick killers. We all are.

I keep my gun and Bible in my home. I recall my late Grandpa Sam’s words with every violent killing in Washington, D.C., and in other states. It’s not that I don’t believe in God to protect me from evil. There is plenty of evil out there to keep God busy. If evil comes, I will be defending myself and others until God can protect us just like Grandpa Sam did nearly 60 years ago.

"Chilling video from the San Diego shooting rampage shows the moment two cops killed the gunman, who is then seen crumpled in a poolside corner.

The footage, taken by residents in the upscale La Jolla Crossroads complex, was captured from an apartment above the pool area and shows the officers blasting away at Peter Selis, ABC News reported.

“They killed him!” one of the witnesses is heard saying in Hebrew, as the camera pans toward the body.

“They’re pulling him out … he wanted to die,” the person says as several more cops arrive at the bloodstained scene.

A few minutes earlier, the 49-year-old auto mechanic, who was sitting on a lounge chair at the pool, opened fire Sunday evening on a group of revelers gathered for a birthday pool party.

He killed Monique Clark, a mother of three, and left seven other people injured, two in critical condition. They were all expected to survive.

San Diego Police Chief Shelley Zimmerman said Selis, who lived at the complex, was distraught about a recent breakup with his girlfriend. He called her in the middle of his attack and told her he had just shot two people.

Police have said race did not play a role in the shooting, but some survivors have come out to argue otherwise.

“As additional factors come in, we realize there are multiple components to this problem, but we feel heartbreak in the fact that (police are) trying to dismiss a part of the motive,” Navy Lt. j.g. Lauren Chapman, who attended the party, told the San Diego Union Tribune.

Most of the roughly 30 people who attended the party were black or Latino. Selis was white, and all but one of the victims were people of color.

“How, in less than 24 hours, did Shelley Zimmerman come to the result that there was no hate involved in this?” said Shane Harris, president of the San Diego Chapter of the National Action Network, a civil rights organization.

Several people on Tuesday recounted details that led them to believe race was a factor in the shooting.

Although the festivities took place about 20 feet away from Selis, he seemingly dismissed two white women who were closer to him, they told the paper.

Selis also did not shoot at a white security guard who ordered him to drop his gun after the shooting began, they added.

They also said that when a white partygoer tried to help a friend who had been shot, she was told to leave and not tend to the black woman, Clark said.

“I believe the group that he was going after was targeted, that’s what I believe,” Mychael Gary told the paper.",1
"BELLINGHAM, Wash. (AP) - A Bellingham man accused of threatening his roommates with a knife is facing charges of a hate crime and assault.



The Bellingham Herald reports 18-year-old Andre Marcel Siftsoff was arrested on charges of first-degree assault, third degree malicious mischief, felony harassment and malicious harassment, which is a hate crime.

Bellingham Police Lt. Danette Beckley says the incident started Sunday when Siftsoff and multiple other people were drinking and started fighting. Siftsoff is accused of going into the kitchen, grabbing a knife and brandishing it toward a roommate while making derogatory statements regarding race and sexual orientation.

The incident was the second hate crime reported to Bellingham Police in the past three weeks.",1
"A racist Snapchat led to the suspension of two high school students this week in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The photoshopped picture, posted Tuesday afternoon, showed a black student surrounded by classmates donning KKK hats.

Students who saw the Snapchat on the Volcano Vista High School’s group in the app quickly reported it to administrators, local news outlet KOB-TV reported. An investigation led to the suspension of two students for 10 days. One student was also kicked off the football team.

“It was awful,” Mary Morrow-Webb, the mother of the student in the picture, told KOB. “It was frightening. I just really got sick to my stomach. I was afraid for my daughters and for the other children there that are at risk for these types of threats.”

The two boys involved in posting the picture said it was meant as a joke, Albuquerque Public Schools told reporters.

“We took this to our police department,” said Superintendent Raquel Reedy, according to KOB. “They came and investigated and are really looking very carefully at whether we should file charges for hate crimes. This is something we’re looking at very carefully because it’s this serious.”

Reedy said the school’s new principal was working to make sure nothing like the incident ever happened again. The principal also addressed the situation in a letter sent home to parents.

“The students who doctored the picture and posted it to social media said it was supposed to be a joke,” principal Vickie Bannerman said in the letter. “Of course, it was in no way funny. In fact, I found it repugnant and hateful.”

Bannerman urged parents to discuss the incident as well as social media and bullying with their high schoolers. She also issued an apology on behalf of the high school.

“You don’t expect your kids going to school and having to deal with racism and discrimination in 2017,” the girl’s father, Lamont Webb, told KOB-TV. “It’s kind of appalling.”

The family had reported racist incidents and bullying in the past, both parents told KOB-TV.

“We’ve been coming in with complaints of my daughter saying someone called her the N-word,” her mother said. “Someone called her a porch monkey and different things like that on a regular basis.”

The girl targeted in the picture has not gone back to school. Neither have her two sisters.

“They say they can’t go back,” her mother said. “And we can’t afford to send our daughters to private school, so what options do they have? They finally have broken my girls. So what do we do?”",1

MARTINSVILLE, Ind. - The City of Martinsville is hoping to honor a woman killed nearly fifty years ago in what police have identified as a hate crime.

On Sept. 16, 1968, 21-year-old Carol Jenkins-Davis was killed while selling encyclopedias. To this day, her family says they’ve gone without closure. This week, the mayors of Martinsville and Rushville honored Carol’s life.

“It’s never too late to do the right thing. Fifty years, ten years, one day, it’s never too late to do what’s right,” Martinsville Mayor Shannon Kohl said.

Kohl says the city will honor Carol Jenkins, Davis’ life by placing a memorial stone and planting a maple tree in the garden of city hall. During the dedication ceremony, Kohl issued an apology to members of Carol’s family who were in attendance.

“Today’s ceremony hopefully will bring closure, strength and a spirit of support and togetherness,” Kohl told the crowd.

Members of Carol Jenkins-Davis’ family described the ceremony as a moment they thought they would never see.

“My parents are growing old and it’s nice that they got to see this before they died,” Carol’s sister Laura Davis said.

During the ceremony, Davis addressed the crowd and asked them to use her sister’s memory and story as a reminder of how far the country still has to come when it comes to race relations.

“These things are going to continue to happen until we come together as one, all striving for the same goal of unity, a better life for our children, a better life for our grandchildren and peace,” she said.

Chris Page, the senior pastor for Hoosier Harvest Church, says he hopes the memorial serves as a sign that times have changed in Martinsville, which historically has had a reputation for racial intolerance.

“ I want Martinsville to be a place that not only was known for intolerance, I would love for it in the future as the years roll on for us to be known specifically as a place for healing and for tolerance,” he said.

While Carol’s family says the memorial dedication was an important moment, they say the only thing that could bring them full closure would be the people responsible for Carol’s murder being brought to justice.

In 2002, Kenneth Richmond, an Indianapolis resident, was arrested and charged in her murder but died before he could stand trial.

The second suspect has yet to be found.",1

"A Shakopee woman has been charged with leading police on a high-speed chase through a residential area in Eden Prairie. My Thi Do, 20, is charged with fleeing a peace officer in a motor vehicle, a felony with a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $5,000 fine. Eden Prairie police were on patrol on Preserve Boulevard near Westwind Drive just before 7:30 p.m. Jan. 1 when they clocked a car driving 50 mph in a 30 mph zone, according to the criminal complaint, signed by Eden Prairie Police Detective Kyle Duchschere. Officers turned on their emergency lights and began to pursue the car. The driver, later identified as Do, didnt stop, even after police flashed a spotlight into her rear window and turned on the siren. Do fled down Anderson Lakes Parkway, reaching speeds of 60 mph in a 30 mph zone, almost colliding with one car and running red lights, according to the complaint. She eventually lost control of the car at the intersection of Bloomington Ferry Road and Pioneer Trail, sliding through the intersection and into a back yard, where she crashed into trees and shrubs, the complaint says. The pursuit went on for almost three miles, police said. Do told officers after her arrest that she knew they were trying to stop her, adding, I dont need this, and I decided just to go, according to the complaint. She admitted that she was trying to get away, the complaint says. Do remains in the Hennepin County Jail on a $20,000 bond. She is scheduled to make a first appearance on the charge today in Hennepin County District Court.",0
"Bible Prayer & Authority

When Jesus had said these words, he raised his eyes to Heaven and said, “Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son now so that he may bring glory to you, for you have given him authority over all men to give eternal life for all that you have given to him. And this is eternal life, to know you, the only true God, and him whom you have sent—Jesus Christ. “I have brought you honour upon earth, I have completed the task which you gave me to do. Now, Father, honour me in your own presence with the glory that I knew with you before the world was made. I have shown your self to the men whom you gave me from the world. They were your men and you gave them to me, and they have accepted your word. Now they realise that all that you have given me comes from you—and that every message that you gave me I have given them. They have accepted it all and have come to know in their hearts that I did come from you—they are convinced that you sent me. “I am praying to you for them: I am not praying for the world but for the men whom you gave me, for they are yours—everything that is mine is yours and yours mine—and they have done me honour. Now I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world and I am returning to you. Holy Father, keep the men you gave me by your power that they may be one, as we are one. As long as I was with them I kept them by the power that you gave me; I guarded them, and not one of them was destroyed, except the son of destruction—that the scripture might come true. “And now I come to you and I say these things in the world that these men may find my joy completed in themselves. I have given them your word, and the world has hated them, for they are no more sons of the world than I am. I am not praying that you will take them out of the world but that you will keep them from the evil one. They are no more the sons of the world than I am—make them holy by the truth; for your word is the truth. I have sent them to the world just as you sent me to the world and I consecrate myself for their sakes that they may be made holy by the truth. “I am not praying only for these men but for all those who will believe in me through their message, that they may all be one. Just as you, Father, live in me and I live in you, I am asking that they may live in us, that the world may believe that you did send me. I have given them the honour that you gave me, that they may be one, as we are one—I in them and you in me, that they may grow complete into one, so that the world may realise that you sent me and have loved them as you loved me. Father, I want those whom you have given me to be with me where I am; I want them to see that glory which you have made mine—for you loved me before the world began. Father of goodness and truth, the world has not known you, but I have known you and these men now know that you have sent me. I have made your self known to them and I will continue to do so that the love which you have had for me may be in their hearts—and that I may be there also.

"‘There’s a system for white people and there’s a system for black people’

“The internet has a long memory and you will have to do a lot of good to live down these allegations.”

That was a state judge’s somber advice to Brianna Brochu, who was expelled by the University of Hartford after her Instagram post detailing how she harassed her roommate went viral.

Brochu, who is white, managed to avoid hate-crime charges against black roommate Chennel “Jazzy” Rowe. She was granted her request for “accelerated rehabilitation” under a program that will erase criminal charges from her record if she completes 200 hours of community service and stays out of trouble for two years – a concession supported by Rowe, the Hartford Courant reports.

Perceived slights from Rowe led Brochu to asymmetrically retaliate, rubbing used tampons on her backpack, putting Rowe’s toothbrush “where the sun doesn’t shine” and putting “moldy clam dip” in her lotions, according to the October Instagram post.

She admitted to licking her roommate’s plate and silverware and the tampon claim, but she told police she lied about the rest on Instagram to “appear funny.” Brochu said Rowe started it by being “rude” and “posting videos of her sleeping and making fun of her snoring.”

The state’s attorney said there was no evidence Brochu showed racial animus toward Rowe in her retaliatory actions, even in Brochu’s social media history, ignoring calls by the NAACP to charge her with a hate crime. According to the Boston Globe, Brochu referred to Rowe as “Jamaican Barbie” and Rowe said she had “throat pain” after Brochu’s tampering.

Black culture news site The Root denounced the “special” treatment given to a white person, “as if systematically contaminating another person’s living space were no big deal.” It quoted from her full Instagram post:

Finally did it yo girl got rid of her roommate!! After 1 1/2 month of spitting in her coconut oil, putting moldy clam dip in her lotions, rubbing used tampons [on] her backpack, putting her toothbrush places where the sun doesn’t shine and so much more I can finally say goodbye Jamaican Barbie.

The president of the state NAACP reiterated its hate-crime demand outside court, according to the Courant: “There’s a system for white people and there’s a system for black people.”

Brochu lost her scholarship and she’ll have to get a mental-health evaluation, all because of petty disagreements with Rowe that started with an argument about the temperature in their room, according to Judge Omar Williams:

He said a day seated in a courtroom would help Brochu get a sense of the problems and challenges people are forced to overcome each day. And many would have gratefully leaped at the opportunity she had to attend college on a scholarship, the judge said. And the price Brochu pays for her conduct will last long after her court case ends, Williams said. Friends, potential employers and even potential romantic partners will learn of Brochu’s conduct with a simple internet search, the judge said. Even her own children might one day learn about their mother’s misconduct.

"One moment, 74-year-old Eli Perkowski was walking home quietly from his daily minyan at Congregation Bais Yehuda, near the border of the Fairfax and Hancock Park neighborhoods. The next, he was being pummeled with a flurry of punches and kicks by an unknown man, in a May 22 assault that was captured on video and went viral on social media.

“It was so quick. He was a vicious guy,” Perkowski told the Journal. “As he swung out and punched me, he was cursing at me. I’m thankful he stopped when he did.”

The incident occurred shortly before 9 a.m. on a residential block near the shul. Though Perkowski was wearing a yarmulke and carrying a tallit bag when attacked, the Los Angeles Police Department is investigating the incident as a “random act,” not a hate crime, said LAPD Officer Mike Lopez.

An LAPD alert circulating in the community describes the attacker as male, light-skinned Black, about 40 years old and a transient.

In public comments soon after the attack, Los Angeles City Councilman Paul Koretz, who represents the district where the incident took place, said Perkowski’s religion may have had something to do with the assault. During a May 24 event at Adat Ari El in Valley Village, Koretz said he believed the attack was a hate crime, even though “it’s not being treated as such.”

A day later, in an official statement, Koretz emphasized cooperation between his office and the LAPD in ensuring the safety of the area’s residents.

“I have requested extra patrols until the incident is resolved,” Koretz said. “At this time, I am working to assure residents are safe, and would like to thank the LAPD for responding to the incident quickly.”

The incident, which occurred at 8:40 a.m. at Detroit Street and Oakwood Avenue, was captured on video by a camera affixed to a nearby private residence. The video shows Perkowski walking on the sidewalk when a loitering man confronts him before punching and kicking him to the ground over the course of 15 seconds. The attacker then walks away and another man comes to Perkowski’s aid.

Anti-Defamation League Senior Associate Director Alison Mayersohn described the footage as a “very disturbing tape of an elderly, identifiably Jewish man being a victim of a brutal assault. … LAPD is doing their investigation and we’ll wait to see the result of that investigation.” But, she added, “From what we understand, they have no reason to believe there was a motivation related to his religion.”

Hatzolah of Los Angeles, an emergency response organization for the local Orthodox community, quickly arrived at the scene, according to Perkowski, a 20-year resident of the heavily Orthodox neighborhood. LAPD officers arrived afterward and suggested he seek medical attention at a hospital, which he declined.

The attack has prompted outrage in the Orthodox Jewish community, due in part to Baruch C. Cohen, a civil trial attorney who was among many people who shared the video of the assault on Facebook.

Cohen, who was not aware how the video found its way onto social media, told the Journal the attack reminded him of incidents in his childhood in the 1960s and ’70s in Far Rockaway, a neighborhood in the New York borough of Queens, when Jews faced attacks on the street as a result of racial tensions.

“I witnessed this type of attack on elderly Jews back in Queens,” Cohen said. “I recall the outrage then — I’m déjà vu-ing the outrage now — and I’m lamenting the absence of perhaps the [Jewish Defense League] that made its mark on the community and made it known we’re off limits — ‘Don’t touch us.’ And the hell that came to the hooligan that disregarded that warning.”

Etz Jacob Congregation Rabbi Rubin Huttler, whose synagogue is nearby on Beverly Boulevard, said he is not aware of similar incidents happening in the neighborhood.

“I think this is a very unique thing and very surprising that it happened,” he said. “[However,] things do happen.” n",1

"EVANSTON, IL — Two Evanston teens were arrested in connection with a report of gunfire Thursday afternoon. Police were called to the 400 block of Custer Avenue around 2:38 p.m. and told that a shooting suspect in a black hooded sweatshirt had been seen running south down Sherman Avenue, police said. One of the first officers to respond saw a man matching the description running down the 300 block of Sherman Avenue and was able to detain him until backup arrived at the scene. A search of a backpack he was carrying turned up a loaded Zastava 9 mm handgun. Ulises J. Barrera, 19, of the 2000 block of Darrow Avenue was arrested and charged with aggravated discharge of a firearm, a felony. Evanston police also spoke to a 22-year-old Chicago man who described an ongoing dispute with Barrera and his friend, identified as 19-year-old Bruno A. Aguilar, of the 1900 block of Brown Avenue. The Chicago man told police he had been driving north through an alley west of the 400 block of Custer Avenue when another car, driven by Aguilar, pulled in front of him headed the opposite direction. Barrera, the man said, was sitting in the cars front passenger seat when he drew a handgun and pointed it at him. The victim told police he rammed their vehicle and tried to turn his car around to head south when Barrera got out of the car and fired a bullet at him. Police said Aguilar, the alleged driver, was detained in the 400 block of and taken to the Evanston Police Department. According to Police Cmdr. Joseph Dugan, a single shell casing was recovered from the alley and multiple witnesses were interviewed by investigators.

"A Montgomery County police officer faces 25 years in prison on charges of fraud and lying in testimony during a workers compensation claim. Gilbert L. Payne, who left the Baltimore City Police Department on a full disability pension in 2007, has been charged in Baltimore City Circuit Court with perjury and felony workers compensation fraud, according to the Office of the State Prosecutor. Authorities allege that Payne falsely testified under oath at a September 2008 workers compensation hearing that he was not employed at the time, nor had he been employed since retiring from the Baltimore City Police Department. In fact, Payne was then employed full time as a Towson University police officer. The charging document alleges that as a result of the fraud, Payne received about $30,000 in payments to which he was not entitled. State Prosecutor Emmet C. Davitt said in the release, Testifying falsely under oath and making false statements in order to fraudulently obtain additional workers compensation funds is never acceptable. It is particularly egregious, however, when such acts are committed by a police officer sworn to uphold the law. A trial date has not been set. The perjury charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years. The fraud charge carries a maximum sentence of 15 years and a fine of $15,000.  Payne was hired by the Montgomery County Police Department on July 12, 2010, and is on administrative leave pending the outcome of the trial and administrative investigation, the department says.",0

"MANCHESTER, NJ — A Manchester Township man who authorities say had thousands of images of children performing sexual acts has been arrested, the Ocean County Prosecutors Office announced Wednesday. Lawrence Fascia, 63, of Manchester, was arrested Tuesday on one count of third-degree possession of child pornography and one count of second-degree child pornography, said Al Della Fave, spokesman for the prosecutors office. Fascia became the target of an investigation after the FBI received an anonymous tip regarding his activities on the internet, Della Fave said. The FBI passed the tip along to the High Tech Crime Unit of the Ocean County Prosecutors office as part of their partnership in the Innocent Images Initiative Task Force, he said. The investigation, by the High Tech Crimes Unit, with assistance from the prosecutors offices Megans Law Unit, revealed that Fascia was allegedly actively trading images with other adults of prepubescent children engaged in sexual acts, Della Fave said. A search warrant was executed at Fascias Drake Road residence on Tuesday, and the search revealed a collection of thousands of graphic images of prepubescent children engaged in sexual acts, as well as evidence of trading the images via email as Fascia built his collection, Della Fave said. Fascias bail was originally set at $25,000, no 10 percent option, by Judge Wendel Daniels. Due to substantial health-related issues, Fascia was released to home confinement, Della Fave said. Fascia is required to be on ankle bracelet monitoring until trial and is prohibited from accessing the internet and electronic devices/computers as a condition of his release, he said. Fascia is also barred from having any contact with minors, Della Fave said. Lawrence Fascia, photo via Ocean County Corrections Department",0

"To better understand the current spike in bigotry and hate in the United States, Yahoo News interviewed historians, sociologists, psychologists and experts who study hate groups. And we spoke to four individuals caught up in the white nationalist movement, including a former Ku Klux Klan leader and a young ex-“social justice warrior,” whose stories are told here .

_____

On Oct. 19, former President George W. Bush traveled to New York City to deliver a speech at an event dedicated to “The Spirit of Liberty: At Home, In the World.”

His message was sobering.

Most of the media focused on Bush’s “implicit rebukes” of the man who currently occupies his old office, Donald J. Trump: his barely veiled critiques of “conspiracy theories and outright fabrication”; of “bullying and prejudice in our public life”; of a “discourse degraded by casual cruelty.”

But less attention was paid to what might have been the most significant part of his speech. George W. Bush, the previous Republican president, was appearing on the political stage for one of the few times since leaving the White House nearly nine years ago – to announce that hate, of all things, was back.

“We’ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism,” Bush lamented. “Bigotry seems emboldened.”

The signs are insistent. The odious memes. The “Heil Trump” salutes. The racist graffiti. A rally to save a Confederate statue — and “unite the right” — that descended into violence, including the death of a young woman counterprotester.

“Recently I was kind of introduced to the concept of activism and rallies,” says Gunther Rice, a 22-year-old New Jersey native who attended that deadly event in Charlottesville but was not implicated in the attack on the woman. “I’m like, ‘Wait, there’s a bunch of white nationalists that go out in public and speak and do all this cool stuff and cool events? Hell yeah.’”

The statistics tell a similar story. The most recent were released by the FBI just this week, the agency’s annual measure of the number of hate crimes reported in the United States the previous year. . The FBI defines a hate crime as “a traditional offense like murder, arson, or vandalism with an added element of bias.” In 2016 there were 6,100 reported instances of people targeted based on their race, religion, sexuality, disability or national origin, an increase of 300 over 2015, and like last year the overwhelming majority of those victims were targeted because of their race or religion. Of the 4,496 targeted because of their race, 50.2 percent were black or African-American. Of the 1,583 targeted because of their religion, 55 percent were Jewish and 25 percent were Muslim. This is the second year in a row that hate crime numbers have increased, reversing the trend of the preceding 20 years.

“I’m not surprised,” said Dr. Jeff McDevitt, an associate dean and director of the Institute on Race and Justice at Northeastern University who has worked with the FBI to train agents to identify hate crimes. The numbers are consistent with those reported in recent months by groups like the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center, he says, as well as by cities and other municipalities. In fact, their numbers for 2017 are looking worse: In America’s six largest cities, more than 525 hate crimes have been committed so far this year, up 22 percent from the same period in 2016. “The reason I’m not surprised is this is just another indication of a coarsening of relations in America in the past year or two, particularly aimed at people of color and certain religious groups.”

Story Continues

Still, hearing a former leader of the free world concede that hate is having a moment? That’s a turning point — an admission that’s impossible to ignore.

Why is this happening? And why now? Haven’t we put hate — the bigotry that Bush denounced as a “blasphemy against the American creed” — behind us?

The answer, sadly, is no. Hatred of outsiders has been a cyclical thing in America, and we seem to be in such a cycle now. Economic and social insecurity fuels bigotry, and new forms of communication — the internet, especially — helps it spread. But psychologists and sociologists over the last few decades have begun to understand the qualities that make a person susceptible to what was once called “xenophobia,” meaning fear of outsiders — a useful term that perhaps deserves to be resurrected in Trump-era America. And understanding how people are recruited into hate is a first step in combating it.

Hate in America began even before there was an America. Among Benjamin Franklin’s many written rants against what he called the “Stupid, Swarthy Germans,” was this: “Why should Pennsylvania, founded by the English, become a Colony of Aliens, who will shortly be so numerous as to Germanize us instead of our Anglifying them, and will never adopt our Language or Customs, any more than they can acquire our Complexion.”

The new nation, he wrote, should be a haven for “the … purely white People in the World”, because so many other places were “black or tawny” [Africa], “chiefly tawny” [Asia], or “swarthy” [most of Europe, including Spain, Italy, France, Russia, and — to the puzzlement of historians for centuries, Sweden.) It is only logical to distrust those who look different, he argued, because “I am partial to the Complexion of my Country, for such Kind of Partiality is natural to Mankind.”

This wariness of “the other” is one of the entwined threads that form the foundational myths of the country — of a melting pot contains within it an assumption that blending in rather than standing out is what is valued; the ideal of pulling oneself up by one’s bootstraps assumes an upper and lower rung of social order with membership rules determined by those already at the top.

And so any graph of America’s emotional temperature over time would show periods of exclusion punctuated by spikes of outright hate.

Slideshow: Hate in America: A look under the hood >>>

As a consensus begins to emerge among experts that the friction we’re now experiencing, from Charlottesville, Va., to Berkeley, Calif., may represent yet another one of those hateful peaks, it’s worth considering what the present moment has in common with the past, and how it differs.

The lesson learned from such a look is that while history and psychology act on our prejudices in predictable ways, hate manifests itself differently in every era.

Today’s haters — the white-nationalist radicals of the so-called alt-right — are not nearly as powerful as Adolf Hitler’s Nazis, or as pervasive as the small-town bigots of the Jim Crow South. But that doesn’t mean they’re harmless. Like all waves of hate, this newest one comes with distinct origins and unique challenges.

Specifically, the rise of the alt-right has been enabled by changing norms and technology that make it easier to become radicalized in the first place. In fact, the rise of hate within America shares roots with the rise of hate toward America; the same tools and trends are helping to facilitate both terrorism and nativism.

Hate, in short, is becoming more accessible than ever before — and that poses a distinctive, and particularly insidious, threat.

*****

Human beings have always harbored bias. The pathways to hate, experts tell us, are hardwired into our brains.

But how does the psychology of prejudice actually work?

One of the earliest attempts to grapple with hate in psychological terms was Instincts of the Herd in Peace and War, a 1916 case study of German anti-English sentiment by British neurosurgeon Wilfred Trotter. Trotter sensed primal forces — “the psychological mechanisms of the wolf” — at work in orchestrating groupthink hatred.

It wasn’t until the rise of the Nazis, however, that psychological inquiries into the nature of hate really took off. Theorists of the time came to regard prejudice as pathological, and they tried to link racism and anti-Semitism to specific personality syndromes.

The most influential of these efforts — and the most widely criticized — was The Authoritarian Personality (1950), a nearly 1,000-page tome authored by philosopher Theodor Adorno, a refugee from Nazi Germany, and a team of psychologists from the University of California, Berkeley. Employing what they called the “F-scale”— a novel way of measuring fascistic tendencies — Adorno and company claimed to have identified a new authoritarian personality type: “rigid thinkers who obeyed authority, saw the world as black and white, and enforced strict adherence to social rules and hierarchies.” Authoritarians became authoritarians for reasons that Freud would recognize, according to the study, and they were more susceptible to bigotry — especially right-wing bigotry — as a result.

The assumption that prejudice was a personality problem, however, soon fell out of fashion. In 1954, Harvard psychologist Gordon Allport published a landmark study, The Nature of Prejudice, that synthesized existing knowledge on the subject and came to a disturbing conclusion: Prejudice isn’t deviant at all, but rather all too human — the natural extension of normal psychological processes. “The human mind must think with the aid of categories,” Allport wrote. “Once formed, categories are the basis for normal prejudgment. We cannot possibly avoid this process. Orderly living depends upon it.”

Since then, most research into prejudice has sought to measure and describe these processes. The prevalence and persistence of stereotyping, for instance, was established long ago. In 1933, Daniel Katz and Kenneth Braly asked 100 Princeton University students to list traits of 10 racial and ethnic groups, then check the five they felt best characterized each group. Because the students agreed so often — 75 percent described “Negroes” as lazy; 79 percent described Jews as shrewd — Katz and Braly were able to prove that these generalizations arose from widespread social attitudes rather than individual experience.

Yet stereotypes are only half of the story. In the 1970s, researchers studying the dynamics of social groups found a pervasive “in-group bias.” Within minutes of being divided into minimally cohesive teams — even on such trivial pretexts as a taste in art — strangers tend to see their own group as superior and seek to maximize their advantage over other groups. Polish-born psychologist Henri Tajfel explained this on the basis of what he called “social identity theory.” According to Tajfel, groups offer people two key benefits: identity (they tell us who we are) and self-esteem (they make us feel good about ourselves). It’s only natural, according to Tajfel, that people believe their own group is better than other groups.

In fact, in-group bias is so potent that it can alter our perceptions of the differences between people. Decades of research into what’s known as the “outgroup homogeneity effect” have shown that we tend to see members of another race, religion, nationality (or even academic field) as an undifferentiated group defined by common traits, while members of our own group, according to Scott Plous of Wesleyan University, appear to constitute a diverse assortment of individuals.

This illusion can, in turn, deform our sense of why others do what they do. In 1979, social psychologist Thomas Pettigrew described what he called the “ultimate attribution error,” a double standard that explains negative outgroup behavior as dispositional (“that’s just what those people are like”) while dismissing positive outgroup behavior as exceptional: a fluke, a stroke of luck, the product of lots of effort, etc.

As blatant displays of bigotry declined in recent years, psychologists turned their attention to the prejudice that lurks below the surface — the so-called implicit bias that most people don’t even realize they harbor. (“I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone,” Hillary Clinton declared during last year’s first presidential debate.)

The most famous yardstick of implicit bias is the implicit association test, or IAT, that was developed nearly 20 years ago by Mahzarin Banaji, current chair of Harvard University’s psychology department, and Anthony Greenwald, a highly regarded social psychologist at the University of Washington. To date, the racial version of the test has been taken online more than 17 million times. It asks subjects to associate positive words with white faces and negative words with black faces, then do the opposite; the difference in reaction times is taken as evidence that making a positive association with members of a different race creates cognitive dissonance.

But while the tendency to treat familiar faces with care and foreigners with caution may be instinctive — it’s certainly part of human culture — the mere fact that our circuitry and civilization are conducive to prejudice doesn’t explain why some people act on their biases and others don’t even realize they’re biased to begin with.

So how does bias become bigotry? And why is white nationalism on the rise now? (Self-described “white nationalists” claim to promote white identity and push for the creation of a separate-but-equal white ethnostate; critics say white nationalism is merely a sanitized public version of white supremacism, which holds that whites are a superior race. Yahoo News uses the two terms interchangeably throughout this story.)

“The capacity to hate is relatively constant,” says Brian Balogh, a history professor at the University of Virginia and a host of “Backstory,” a popular history podcast. “But there are certain circumstances that tend to bring it front and center.”

*****

Hate has been simmering under the surface of American life since the beginning. There have been ebbs and flows of xenophobia, directed at specific groups, such as the Chinese, the targets of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. But historians generally agree that America has endured four especially hateful eras — and that each of them can help us figure out what’s happening today.

The first began during Reconstruction, when the Ku Klux Klan emerged in the defeated South, its malice aimed at freed slaves who were exercising newly granted rights.

Next, the early 1920s, when Klan activity increased again, now directed at recent immigrants — particularly Catholics and Jews from Southern and Eastern Europe. Those years marked the first era that immigration quotas were established in the U.S.

Third, the “Great Deportations,” also known as the “Mass Deportations” of the Depression Era. In this little-remembered episode during the 1930s, more than half a million Mexican immigrants – including one-third of the entire Mexican population of Los Angeles — were repatriated by the Hoover administration. Among these were hundreds of thousands of children who were born in the U.S. and therefore American citizens. These were followed in the next decade by the Japanese internment camps during World War II.

Then came the civil rights movement of the 1950s and ’60s, when the two steps forward in voting rights and housing and school desegregation sparked the one bloody and chilling step backward of racial reaction: lynchings in the South and race riots in the North.

And the final major spike on the graph? Many sociologists who study hate believe we are at the beginning of it right now — a period that is in its own way as dark as, while also substantially different from, some of the worst of times that came before.

Carol Anderson, chair of African-American studies at Emory University and the author of the book “White Rage,” offered some examples in a recent essay:

“The ‘Heil Trump’ salutes at a gathering of white nationalists shortly before the inauguration. An uptick in reported hate crimes across the country. The killing of Lt. Richard Collins by a white supremacist in Maryland. The double homicide and severe wounding of good Samaritans defending teen girls in Portland [Ore.] from another white supremacist. The nooses found at and near the National Museum of African American History and Culture.”

Any analysis of American hate, therefore, requires parsing what these eras do and do not have in common.

Albert Camarillo, an emeritus professor of history at Stanford University,who specializes in the study of American minorities, believes all hateful chapters start with the same stewing “intolerance, a hatred, a feeling of ‘our problems are caused by someone else and something needs to be done about that.’ That’s fundamental whether you’re talking about the 1860s or the 1960s or the times between and since.”

Economic uncertainty also plays a major role here. John Higham, in his seminal analysis of American nativism, “Strangers in the Land,” found a correlation between downturns in economic opportunity and the emergence of hate. During Reconstruction, more prosperous Southern whites lost wealth with the emancipation of the slaves and working-class whites lost jobs to a newly freed workforce. Later, during the Depression, white workers blamed their struggles on Mexican immigrants, although the newcomers were, statistically speaking, even worse off.

A second and related factor these eras share was the feeling that a group that was accustomed to being “in charge” was looking over their shoulder at a group threatening to overtake them.

“It’s a strand of people acting as if they are independent when others don’t think they should be,” says Nell Irvin Painter, emeritus professor of history at Princeton University, where she taught African-American history and a former president of both the Organization of American Historians and the Southern Historical Association.

During Reconstruction, that notion manifested itself in attempts by the KKK to keep newly liberated blacks from voting. During the 1920s, it was a reaction to sheer numbers — more than a million immigrants arrived each year in the United States before the war, literally changing the complexion of American society, creating the highest ratio ever of foreign- to native-born. The response by Congress was sharp curbs on immigration, mostly notably the Johnson-Reed Act of 1924, whose co-author, Washington state Rep. Albert Johnson, was described by his biographer as a “fanatic and eugenicist.” The passage of his bill, Johnson said, would end “indiscriminate acceptance of all races,” in America.

The last factor that all these eras had in common was political and cultural leadership that condoned the expression hateful views. After World War I, that was provided by President Woodrow Wilson, who had worked to resegregate employees of the federal government and who held a screening of the blatantly racist film “The Birth of a Nation” in the White House. During the civil rights era it was personified by such politicians as Lester Maddox, Strom Thurmond and George Wallace.

And what role do these factors play in the current outbreak of white nationalism? There is ample evidence that all three are at work, historians say.

First, there is a feeling of deep economic instability. The Great Recession of 2007 upended the for millions of Americans, and recovery has been uneven. Americans lost an estimated $16 trillion in household wealth in that downturn, and while the highest earners have regained more than they lost, those at the bottom have recouped as little as one-third of their losses.

Coupled with that is the realization by some that they are regressing in other ways. Partly owing to the opioid epidemic, life expectancy is decreasing in the U.S. for the first time since the AIDS crisis. The millennial generation is predicted to be the first to be less well off than their parents. Entire industries face disruption and in some cases disappearance.

But economics now appear to play a secondary role in today’s environment.

Speaking of the white supremacist marches at the University of Virginia, where he is a professor of history, Balogh says: “A lot of those protestors were fairly well off. To invest in the weaponry and equipment they came with, I don’t think you pay the cost of all that, and the cost of travel, without having resources. There’s no question that if you pull the camera back you could argue that this is a moment of incredible flux for the U.S., a hemorrhag[ing] of certain jobs … but that wasn’t the direct, linear reason why many of those individuals were marching and chanting.”

More likely, he suggests, economics served as backdrop for the second factor — the feeling that a historically dominant group, in this case white men, feel that dominance ending. The percentage of non-Hispanic whites in the U.S. is currently at just over 60 percent, a record low (as recently as 1980 the country was 80 percent white) and is projected to dip below 50 percent by 2043. Already nearly half of American children under age 5 are of races other than white, and by 2019 there are expected to be more nonwhites in America younger than 18 than there will be whites in the same age group.

“For a lot of these men, they perceive their world slipping through their fingers and other people benefiting from their loss,” says Camarillo. “That’s not to say there aren’t elements of truth in their world changing, but when that fear is projected on another group of people, then it expresses itself as hate.”

And, finally, now as then there is the ascendance of leadership that is seen to condone the worst forms of expression. It is not coincidental, Painter and others say, that this reactionary uptick follows the two terms of the first African-American president.

“I think the spark this time around was the Obama presidency, which I think shook a segment of America to the core,” she says. “He was the embodiment of a political change, societal change, which has been taking place for the past couple of generations but haltingly. This made it real.”

The election of the next president, Balogh agrees, left those who “espouse racial superiority to feel emboldened to speak out.” He does not believe that all of Donald Trump’s supporters are racist, but rather that those who are sense permission and even support from the current administration.

“The very important role of Donald Trump personally and elements of the Republican Party was to help make this seem like legitimate public discourse,” he says. “It is hard to find, in the post-World War II period, any president who legitimized the views of white nationalism and white supremacism as effectively as Donald Trump has.”

Studies have substantiated this effect. A working paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that more participants were willing to openly donate money to an anti-immigrant organization after the election (48 percent) than before the election (34 percent). And last year, University of Kansas psychologist Chris Crandall asked , both before the election and in the days after, to rate how normal it was to denigrate members of various minority groups. Both Clinton and Trump supporters were more likely to report that such discrimination was acceptable after Election Day.

“Lots of people criticized Dwight D. Eisenhower on race and felt he could have done more, felt he could have been more courageous,” Balogh continues. “And he was not in fact a thought leader on race. He didn’t like Brown,” the Supreme Court decision that ended legal school segregation. Nevertheless, Balogh says, when school doors were barred to black school children in Little Rock, Ark., “Eisenhower sent troops.”

Similarly, while Richard Nixon campaigned on his opposition to school busing and George H.W. Bush ran the “Willie Horton” ad, intended to create white fear of black violence, “all these things were miles away from embracing white nationalist thought or putting people who embraced it close to themselves in the Oval Office,” Balogh points out. “You would be hard-pressed to find any example in all this history of a leader who said anything like ‘There were some nice people standing among the neo-Nazis.’”

*****

What President Trump actually said in the wake of August’s tragic events in Charlottesville, after a “Unite the Right” rally descended into violence and death, was even more emphatic than Balogh recalls.

“You had some bad people in that group,” Trump declared. “But you also had some people who were very fine people.”

These were not “rough, bad people” — not “neo-Nazis and white nationalists,” he clarified. Instead, they were “people protesting very quietly” — “innocently,” even — “the taking down of a statue of Robert E. Lee.”

“I watched those [protests] very closely,” Trump concluded, addressing the national media. “Much more closely than you people watched it.”

However closely he may have watched, however, his conclusion was demonstrably wrong. As conservative journalist Stephen Hayes has pointed out, there was really only one kind of right-winger at that rally — the white supremacist kind. Its organizer, Jason Kessler, is an avowed white nationalist. The purpose of the march, according to promotional materials, was to protect “the right of white people to organize for our interests.” Its speaker list was a who’s who of white nationalist leaders. Its participants shouted “F*** you, faggots!” and “Blood and soil!” and “Jews will not replace us!” And according to a Charlottesville-based nonprofit dedicated to preserving some Confederate-themed monuments, “Nobody from our group attended the protests or counterprotests. We all stayed away. As everybody should have done.”

Trump’s confusion — the fact that he says he saw “very fine people” where there were only white supremacists — is telling. Because what psychology and history would indicate he saw when he “watched those [protests] very closely” on TV, was white supremacists who didn’t conform to his “rough, bad” stereotype.

He saw white supremacists in white polo shirts and khakis — not white robes. White supremacists with college degrees, like Kessler, a UVA grad — not a motley crew of high-school dropouts. White supremacists with sharp haircuts — not swastika tattoos. White supremacists who were fluent in cutting-edge pop culture — not confined to a backwoods compound in Idaho or Tennessee.

This is what hate is starting to look like in today’s America: better educated, more prosperous and more “mainstream” than before.

“Members of the alt-right are … qualitatively different from the KKK of a generation ago,” political scientist George Hawley, the author of “Making Sense of the Alt-Right,” has explained. “They’re very well-trained, very well-educated, and they have a lot of time on their hands.”

The fact that even the president of the United States couldn’t tell these protesters were white supremacists is a troubling sign of how the audience for bigotry is broadening — and how some of the old psychological barriers to hate are breaking down.

By now — 15 months after Hillary Clinton characterized this “loosely organized,” “mostly online” “movement” as an “emerging racist ideology” that “rejects mainstream conservatism, promotes nationalism and views immigration and multiculturalism as threats to white identity” — the alt-right has been diagrammed and dissected to death. The surreal memes. The transgressive “humor.” The insane conspiracy theories. The insular web culture. The White House ties. The echoes of nationalist movements in Europe. The sprawling cast of characters, ranging from Brooks Brothers-clad neo-Nazi Richard Spencer to Hitler-loving internet troll Andrew Anglin .

Journalists have explored the movement from several different angles: cultural, economic and political.

But what no one has really explained is the psychology of it all.

*****

Experts have plenty to say about the roots of bias. Yet when it comes to actual bigotry — bias that crosses the line into deliberate word or deed — the science is shakier. Why do some people act on their prejudices while so many others do not? Why do some people become extremists, letting hate define them?

The best way — perhaps, at the moment, the only way — to look for answers is by looking at terrorism. While the alt-right is a new (and largely unresearched) phenomenon, the psychological processes that produce a Unite the Right rallygoer may have a lot in common with the psychological processes that, taken further in a different cultural context, produce an ISIS soldier. A subset of researchers has been studying the psychology of terrorist recruitment for years.

“Today, the parallels between the alt-right and radical jihadism are clear,” argues Scott Atran, the director of research in anthropology at the CNRS École Normale Supérieure and a senior research fellow at the University of Oxford.

“Ideology is one piece of the puzzle,” says John Horgan, professor of global studies and psychology at Georgia State University and author of “The Psychology of Terrorism.” “But beneath that is something far more powerful: the ebb and flow of everyday human psychology. Whether you’re alt-right, alt-left, anti-government, or just a jihadi, the psychology is the same. Those feelings of frustration, insecurity, paranoia, anxiety, jealousy, desperation, all tangled up in a lack of direction and purpose — these are the real forces at work. And the internet just makes it worse.”

A recent preliminary online survey of self-identified alt-rightists by psychologists Patrick Forscher and Nour Kteily hinted at some tendencies and traits that might distinguish members of the movement from the general population. (Forscher and Kteily are currently surveying a larger sample group to confirm their findings.)

Respondents scored highly on measures of dehumanization, rating Muslims, Democrats, black people, Mexicans, journalists, Jews and feminists as significantly less evolved than whites. They showed high support for groups that work for the benefit of white people, and they were more willing than most Americans to express prejudice toward black people. They also “scored higher on social dominance orientation (the preference that society maintains social order), right-wing authoritarianism (a preference for strong rulers), and somewhat higher levels of the “dark triad” of personality traits (psychopathy, Machiavellianism and narcissism),” as Vox’s Brian Resnick put it in his summary of the paper.

All of which is intriguing, in a descriptive sense. But it’s hardly determinative. Many Americans likely share these views. What transforms someone into an extremist, radicalization experts now agree, isn’t a pathology or personality type (contra Theodor Adorno). It’s “the person-changing dynamic of the group,” as Atran recently explained.

In a wide-ranging 2016 article for Scientific American, leading researchers Stephen D. Reicher and S. Alexander Haslam synthesized and summarized the existing psychological literature on group dynamics to illuminate how ordinary people move toward radicalism. The process they detailed can be divided into roughly four (not necessarily sequential) steps: 1) susceptibility 2) misrecognition 3) identification and disidentification and 4) polarization.

If you’re looking for signs of alt-right susceptibility, the prejudices identified in Forscher and Kteily’s survey probably qualify. But so do some less exotic traits, like age and gender. The vast majority of terrorists are young and male. The vast majority of U.S. mass shooters are too. And the same goes for alt-righters.

Having yet to form a secure identity, all young adults “search for meaning and belonging in groups,” notes Horgan; the company of others is a particularly effective in stimulating the reward pathways of the young adult brain, according to the research. But while girls are neurologically primed to build coalitions and fear ostracism, boys are primed to assert dominance and to stand out. The result is a tendency to seek a sense of identity through confrontation, a dynamic familiar to anyone who has followed the alt-right evolution’s from a kind of punky internet counterculture to a more potent real-life movement — from the doxxers of GamerGate to Milo Yiannapoulos’s campus shenanigans to the more violent displays in Charlottesville.

It’s no coincidence, for instance, that white-nationalist shock jock Mike Enoch “found strength in contrarianism” when he was younger — not to advance any particular agenda, a relative recently told the New Yorker, but simply “to stir up resentment.”

“Misrecognition” is the term that Reicher, one of the authors of the Scientific American article, gave to the “experience of having others misperceive or deny a valued identity.” Reicher’s study, conducted in 2013, focused on Muslim Scots returning home and being treated with suspicion at airport security, which in turn “provoked anger and cynicism toward authorities” and “led these individual to distance themselves” from mainstream society. “Why am I being made to feel as the other in my own house?” one asked.

Listen to any alt-right sympathizer rant for two minutes and you’ll hear similar complaints — only in this case about an increasingly diverse and politically correct America that (in their view) bends over backward for feminists, immigrants, blacks and other “social justice warriors” at the expense of the very people who founded this country: white men like them. There might not be objective evidence for that sense of misrecognition, but it feels real, and it motivates them all the same.

“I started out as a leftist,” says John May, a member of the Traditionalist Worker Party who spoke to Yahoo News at a White Lives Matter rally in Shelbyville, Tenn., last month. “I was an anarchist and went into left-wing politics and socialism and realized, growing up in Houston, you can’t just be a leftist and be for your people at the same time. I mean, you can’t walk down the street without getting attacked just for being a white guy.”

Perhaps the most pivotal stage of the radicalization process, however, is the one that typically happens next: identification (and its corollary, disidentification). Here’s where the pioneering work of Henri Tajfel resurfaces. As Reicher and Haslam put it, Tajfel (and his student John Turner) demonstrated that “for someone to follow a group — possibly to the point of violence — he or she must identify with its members and, at the same time, detach from people outside the group, ceasing to see them as his or her concern.”

This jibes with a recent description by French deradicalization expert Dounia Bouzar of how terrorist recruits come to identify as terrorists. First, they disengage from their social circles, immersing themselves, usually online, in rhetoric that “convinces them that they live in a world in which adults and society lie — about food safety, medicine and vaccinations, history and politics.” They “start to doubt everything,” and start to believe that “secret societies” — a Zionist conspiracy, the Illuminati, the Freemasons — are “buying up the planet.” They devour YouTube videos and scour recruiting websites, many of which “cleverly reference films such as “The Matrix,” in which the protagonist, Neo, wonders if he should take a [red] pill that will wake him up and show him the truth about reality or if he should keep on sleeping, blissfully oblivious.” They decide to swallow the red pill — and shun everyone who hasn’t, dismissing them as “blind, asleep or, worse, sellouts to the system.”

Next, recruits conclude that “only true Islam can renew and reawaken” them; that they are “among the chosen people, who are more discerning than they rest.”

Then comes the final step, according to Bouzar: dehumanization. “All those who do not follow the recruit’s same path of ‘awakening’ are considered not really human,” she writes. “Killing them is not a crime and is even a duty.”

Members of the alt-right are not terrorists; they do not plot acts of mass murder. But they are radicals, and their path to identification (and disidentification) bears striking similarities to a typical terrorist’s.

Conspiracy theories, for instance, are rampant on the alt-right: the one about “a secret society of pedophiles operating out of a pizza place loosely connected to [Hillary] Clinton associate David Brock”; the one about all the left-wing antifascist (or “antifa”) groups “planning to kill every single Trump voter, conservative and gun owner” the weekend of Nov. 4; even the one that animates the entire movement, which is that Jews and “social-justice warriors” and “globalists” in “predominantly white countries” around the world are promoting “mass immigration, racial integration, miscegenation, low fertility rates and abortion” in order to “deliberately turn them minority white and hence cause white people to become extinct through forced assimilation.”

Research has shown that the more radical a person’s politics — whether left- or right-wing — the more susceptible they are to conspiracy theories. Collective narcissism is another psychological marker — that is, the belief that one’s own group or nation is superior to others and deserves admiration. And according to a pair of studies published in the journal Applied Cognitive Psychology in 2015, conspiracy theorists also tend to feel a lack of control over their lives. Terrorist recruits and alt-rightists share these traits.

“Conspiracy theorists believe [in conspiracy theories] because it restores a sense of agency,” Viren Swami, a professor of social psychology at Anglia Ruskin University, has explained. “It gives them a sense of power. It gives them a sense that they can do something about the world.”

The rhetoric of awakening to a hidden truth, meanwhile, is nearly identical among terrorist recruits and alt-right adherents. In fact, members of the alt-right constantly use the same “Matrix” reference as terrorists — i.e., taking the red pill — to describe their moment of conversion.

Dehumanization is typical as well. Recall the preliminary psychological portrait of the alt-right. When Kteily asked alt-rightists to rate certain groups on a scale of 0 (not human at all) to 100 (fully human) — he used the famous “March of Progress” image as a guide — respondents doled out chillingly low scores.

The final step in the radicalization process is what Reicher and Haslam call “co-radicalization.” In the context of terrorism, co-radicalization means “provok[ing] other groups to treat one’s own group as dangerous” — usually via attacks — which ultimately “helps consolidate followers around those very leaders who preach greater enmity.”

On the alt-right, the dynamic is similar, if less murderous: memes and trolls and campus stunts designed to trigger outsize attention and mainstream denunciations — Hillary Clinton’s anti-alt-right speech, for example — that in turn feed a self-serving cycle of censure, conflict and conversion. “Terrorism,” Reicher and Haslam write, “is all about polarization. It is about reconfiguring intergroup relationships so that [extremism] appears to offer the most sensible way of engaging with an extreme world.” The same might be said of the alt-right.

Yet from a psychological perspective the rise of the alt-right also represents something new — a sign that the same technologies that have enabled terrorists to increase their ranks are now helping to make hate accessible and even attractive to Americans who until recently might have seemed immune.

In nearly every way, the internet seems tailor-made to amplify and accelerate the psychological process of radicalization.

As sites like Breitbart stoke fears of invading immigrants and a looming loss of white status, psychologists Maureen Craig and Jennifer Richeson have “run experiments showing white participants who read about demographic change are — on average — more likely to respond to statements like ‘I would rather work alongside people of my same ethnic origin’ in the affirmative.” Even minimal exposure to “threatening” information, in other words, can make a white person more prejudiced.

Meanwhile, psychologist John Suler has described what he calls the “online disinhibition effect” — that is, “the lack of restraint one feels when communicating online in comparison to communicating in person.” As a result, outrage-inducing rhetoric has saturated the internet, notes neuropsychologist Molly Crockett; social media, she says, serves to trigger it, spread it and minimize its personal repercussions.

This, in turn, has fueled online echo chambers — Reddit, 4Chan, fake-news-filled Facebook feeds — that capitalize on our false consensus bias and trick susceptible individuals into overestimating how “normal” alt-right views really are. As social psychologists and Dominic Abrams and Kevin Dutton have put it, “when groups start becoming isolated from conventional society, this innate propensity to ‘swarm and norm’” — “to follow the example of those we identify with and disregard everyone else” — “can form a springboard for cliques, cults and other kinds of extremists.”

Real-life action isn’t far behind. Usually, potential radicals are reluctant to go it alone. But social media alleviates this “collective action problem,” according to political scientist Richard Hasen, because it lets these would-be extremists see others like them who are willing to share the risk. And research by sociologist Mark Granovetter suggests that a movement like the alt-right can start growing much more rapidly once it crosses some expected threshold — or, in the case of the internet, makes it seem as if a lot of like-minded people are rallying around its ideas.

“The rise of social media,” writes Atran, the anthropologist, “has allowed people who might want to be part of the white supremacist movement to adhere without incurring the stigma previously associated with physically joining.”

A quick historical comparison illustrates the differences between analog radicalization and digital radicalization. Don Black is the founder of Stormfront, the first major white nationalist website; before that, he was a grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and a sidekick of David Duke. He recently told Yahoo News how, as a young anti-Communist in Athens, Ala., he started down the path to white nationalism.

“Back in the day, in 1969, when I was 15 years old, you actually had to find a mailing address and write,” Black said. “You know, the old-fashioned way. And a couple of weeks later they’d send you back a packet of literature.”

To spread the word, Black handed out pamphlets at his high school — and got questioned by the FBI and the county sheriff as a result. Then he realized there were “student handbooks with the actual home addresses of every student in the school, and postal rates were fairly cheap,” he said. “So I started mailing to everybody.”

Becoming a right-wing radical today requires far less effort and exposure — in part thanks to Black. Gunther Rice attended a high school where 50 different languages were spoken; he was a self-described “social justice warrior” until the age of 16, when he began to question the liberal values he’d been raised with. After that, radicalization was largely a matter of surfing the web.

“I just came to Stormfront and like, looked into ‘How the f*** do people get this mentality?’” Rice told Yahoo News following last month’s White Lives Matter rally in Shelbyville, Tenn. “And I went, ‘Yeah, my school did teach me that! Ever since I was a kindergartener, they do have an anti-white historical narrative!’ My mind was blown just by the hypocrisy I had seen.”

Asked what drew him to the Traditionalist Worker Party, Jimmy Mayberry, Rice’s fellow member, didn’t hesitate.

“Internet culture,” said Mayberry, 24. Not long after losing his factory job in January, Mayberry came across a video of TWP founder Matthew Heimbach “debating with two leftists at inauguration day.”

“I don’t know anything about this group,” Mayberry said to himself, “but I know I gotta find out more of it. … These people seem awesome!”

John May, another TWP member, agrees. “The internet is pretty much the best route these days to find like-minded people,” he said.

*****

What, then, is the way out?

Historians would tell us that there is some small comfort in the fact that that while hate seems cyclical, its breadth and acceptability decrease with each episode.

“It has changed over time,” says Camarillo. “There is still a thread of racial hatred, but there is also more tolerance, more pushing back and saying ‘you’re wrong.’”

In fact, the history of the fight against hate can be seen as the extinguishing ever smaller fires — marches with tiki torches in territory where there used to be lynchings, limits on Muslim immigration where there once were Japanese internment camps. The Mexican deportations of the 1930s, Camarillo says by way of one example, “were based on bald racial hatred and no sector of society stood up for the Mexicans.” In contrast, he says, the threat of similar deportations under the current administration brought vocal opposition.

“History tells me I have to be optimistic,” he says. “We see these ugly flashpoints today, but they are different from what we teach and write about in the past. Racial hatred and racial attitudes die hard. They do die, but they die hard.”

Psychologists, on the other hand, would warn that the road through this current chapter could be particularly rocky and its destination essentially uncertain. The suppression of hate depends on pushback by the mainstream, clarity that the hateful views are not the norm. With the wildcard of new technology, however, and the resulting bubbles and echo chambers, it is ever more possible to live in a world where one’s views are only reinforced, never challenged.

The result makes radicalization, hatred and bigotry simultaneously less obvious and more accessible. And because they are both those things, they are more likely to seep into, and to infect, the mainstream conversation.

By way of evidence, look to the fact that alt-right champions Steve Bannon and Steven Miller made it into the White House. Or that Trump himself has repeatedly retweeted alt-right memes.

Or this story from Charlottesville:

As tensions ratcheted up, a reporter saw a young white supremacist running, terrified, from a crowd of liberal counterprotesters. Suddenly, the man ripped off his Vanguard America shirt in the middle of the street.

“I’m not really white power, man,” he whimpered. “I just did it for the fun. I’m sorry.”

“What happened?” the reporter asked him.

“Scared the shit out of me,” he replied.

Later, the young man explained why he had come to Charlottesville.

“It’s kind of a fun idea,” he said, almost smirking. “Just being able to say ‘white power,’ you know?”

Perhaps the moral of that story is encouraging. The would-be supremacist backed down and didn’t hurt anyone.

On the other hand, perhaps the moral is this: It’s now “fun” to say “white power” — and not only that, but to show up at a rally, in person, and square off in the streets.

A few hours later, another young white supremacist with the same white polo shirt ran over 19 counterprotesters with his Dodge Challenger, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer.

If that man had not been behind the wheel of that car on that day, but rather out in the crowd, chanting, it’s possible that the president of the United States might have mistaken him, too, for a “very fine person.”

"James Alex Fields, Jr. (Photo: Provided)

Before leaving for Charlotteville, Virginia, the Northern Kentucky native charged with federal hate crimes in a Wednesday indictment allegedly texted, Were not the ones who need to be careful, to a relative along with a photo of Adolf Hitler.

Prosecutors say James Alex Fields, 21, drove his car into a crowd of protesters at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing one and injuring dozens.

The Department of Justice announced that an indictment returned Wednesday charges Fields who lives in Ohio, but originally from Boone County, Kentucky, with 30 crimes.

One of the charges was a hate crime resulting in the death of Heather Heyer, 33, of Charlottesville. Twenty-eight other hate crimes were also filed related to the others injured in the incident.

The indictment states that before leaving for Charlottesville, a relative of Fields texted him asking him to be careful. In reply, Fields said Were not the ones who need to be careful, and included a photo of Adolf Hitler, according to documents.

Once in Charlottesville and after the Unite the Right was dispersed by police, Fields rapidly accelerated, through a stop scene and across a raised pedestrian mall, and drove directly into the crowd, the indictment states. As Fields drove into and through the crowd, Fields struck numerous individuals, killing Heather Heyer and injuring many others.

Fields was already facing first-degree murder charges in Virginia.

He was photographed hours before the attack with a shield bearing the emblem of one of the hate groups taking part in the rally. He has been in custody since then.

While Fields and his mother lived in a Florence condominium, authorities from the Boone County Sheriffs Office and the Florence Police Department responded nine times from November 2010 through February 2013 to the location, according to records.

Former classmates and teachers of Fields at Randall K. Cooper High School previously described Fields strange behavior to The Enquirer.

Caitlin Wilson, a graduate of Cooper who went to school with Fields, said as early as middle school Fields would draw swastikas and talk about loving Hitler.

“When I saw his mugshot, I wasn’t shocked,” she told The Enquirer in August.

Former Cooper teacher Derek Weimer had told The Enquirer there was a complaint filed by a teacher regarding an assignment Fields turned in that was very much along the party lines of the neo-Nazi movement.

The Dodge Challenger that struck the crowd of counter-protesters at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville on Aug. 12 was purchased from a Greater Cincinnati car dealership and last registered in Ohio, online records show.

A Carfax report shows the vehicle was purchased by its latest owner in June 2015 from Kerry Toyota in Florence. The title for the vehicle was updated the next month in Maumee, a suburb of Toledo where Fields had moved with his mother.

This is an ongoing feature keeping track of bills that states are introducing to extend hate crime protections to police officers. It will be updated monthly or as the need arises.

WASHINGTON ― Last week, The Huffington Post determined that state legislatures had introduced at least 32 bills in 2017 proposing that hate crime protections be extended to members of law enforcement, adding to 15 such bills that states introduced in 2016.

Since we published last week’s analysis, at least one bill was added to the list — Mississippi’s House Bill 645, which did not initially stipulate that police officers were protected under the state’s hate crime statute until it was amended in a state Senate committee. Along with Mississippi HB 645, a bill in Kentucky has advanced to the state’s governor. Another bill in Washington state has passed the state Senate.

HuffPost Visuals Editor Alissa Scheller has created the awesome graphic to track these bills, and we’ll routinely update it with new information.

Meanwhile, here’s a simple list of all the legislation states are pursuing to categorize crimes against police officers as hate crimes, including the bill numbers and their current status.

"CLOSE Indiana is one of five states without a hate crime law with penalties, even though local police agencies are supposed to report them. Just what is a hate crime here? Wochit

Hateful graffiti and remains of an attempt arson sit behind a northwest side business owned by the Patnaik family. (Photo: Provided by Rejesh Patnaik)

A little more than nine years after moving from their home country of India to the United States, Rejesh and Vidhya Patnaik always will remember 2017.

Along with being the year that the Indianapolis couple became American citizens, it also marks the first time that they became victims of a hate-based attack, targeted and belittled simply because of who they are and what they believe in.

It took us a little while to wrap our heads around the whole thing, Rejesh Patnaik said. We’ve been in this location five years now, and we’ve never seen or experienced anything like this. Ever.

Stand against hate: Take a stand: Pledge to end the hate

Did you know?: From vandalism to murder: Hate crimes you didnt know were happening in Indiana

What is a hate crime?: Heres what is a hate crime in Indiana and what isnt

On Monday morning, the Patnaiks arrived at work to find the front of their northwest-side business, Signs By Tomorrow, covered in anti-Hindu graffiti and grease markings.

We were just about to open the door, and suddenly our eyes went to the windows and we saw a lot of scribbling. ... Then we saw the words om shanti om, which is a chant that Hindus say when we pray, Patnaik said. That is when we realized what we were seeing.

Around back, more graffiti covered the rear of the building, and the culprits left behind evidence that someone tried to set fire to the business.

The spray paint behind the building called them traitors and satanists.

That was a little more painful to see, Patnaik said. We just couldnt believe it.

The Patnaiks were stunned, but they still had work to do to. So they called the police to file a report, informed their property managers about the damage and returned their focus to serving the community. In return, the community came together to aid the Patnaiks and erase every last hateful marking from their business.

By Monday afternoon, the storefront was clean. By noon Tuesday, the back was freshly painted. Throughout the process, the Patnaiks continued to meet the needs of their customers and make deliveries.

The family also is making clear that it will take more than ignorance, hate and graffiti to slow them down or frighten them.

The support ... it has been just overwhelming. It all started with the first lady from the neighboring business coming over to apologize and show her support. From that moment until now, so many people, even complete strangers, have stood in support with us, Patnaik said. I cant even explain what that feels like.

The impact of the incident is being felt by members of the interfaith community throughout Central Indiana.

The Center for Interfaith Cooperation said in a written statement that the act was intended to intimidate and isolate our Hindu neighbors.

The Center for Interfaith Cooperation declares to the Patnaiks, the Central Indiana Hindu community and to all those who feel vulnerable because of how you worship: You are not alone. We stand with you. An attack on any one of us, is an attack on all of us.

Raju Chinthala, founder and president of the Indiana India Business Council, said the store being covered in hateful messages is not a true reflection of what life in Indianapolis is like.

Chinthala said the graffiti appears to be a personally directed attack, born of misconception from a troubled or an uninformed mind.

There is no space of hate, fear or intimidation in our community, and well be pleased to work with others towards this goal, he said.

The India Association of Indianapolis took to Facebook to condemn such acts of hate.

While this is sporadic event, it is unfortunate events like this that tears apart the basic fabric of our country and exposes the very negligible yet very disturbing instigators of hate, the associations statement said.

The Hindu Temple of Central Indiana Board of Trustees expressed deep sadness over the vandalism and has pledged to stand by the Patnaik family.

The Hindu community in Central Indiana is 50,000 strong. We are mothers, fathers, teachers, students, doctors, engineers, lawyers, accountants, real-estate agents and more, the group said in a written statement. We know that the extremist individuals who perpetrated this act of hatred do not represent the good people of Central Indiana.

The India Association of Indianapolis and the Hindu Temple of Central Indiana Board of Trustees support efforts to bring hate crime legislation to the state of Indiana.

Indiana is one of five states without a law addressing penalties for hate crimes that target people because of certain characteristics, such as their race, religion or sexual orientation. But the state does require law enforcement agencies to record such crimes and report them to the Indiana State Police.

Attempts to pass a hate crimes bill have failed for years. Most recently a measure authored by Sen. Susan Glick, R-LaGrange, would have allowed judges to impose tougher sentences for crimes motivated by race, religion, sex, disability, gender identity or sexual orientation. But opponents argued that hate crime laws create special protected classes that treat victims of similar crimes differently.

The bill passed the Senate in 2016, but did not get a hearing in the House. It was revived again this year but failed to get enough support in the Senate. The measure died in February on the same day a bomb threat was issued to the JCC of Indianapolis.

"Mark Meechan stared at the camera and described the training he had recently given to his girlfriend’s pug, Buddha.

“My girlfriend is always ranting and raving about how cute and adorable her wee dog is,” he said in his Scottish brogue. “And so I thought I would turn him into the least cute thing I could think of, which is a Nazi.”

Then Meechan asked the dog the same question, again and again: “Buddha, do you want to gas the Jews?”

So began a video that has raised questions about the murky line between offensive-but-legal satire and hate speech. Critics claim Meechan’s video crosses that line and promotes violence against Jews at a time when similar satire is accused of normalizing Nazism.

Meechan said that if found guilty, he could be sentenced to a year in prison.

In the “M8 Yer Dugs A Nazi” video posted in April 2016 (which obviously contains offensive language), the dog becomes animated every time Meechan says the phrase or the word “Jews.”

At one point, Meechan says “Sieg Heil,” the Nazi salutation (in German it means “hail victory”), and the dog extends its right paw, mimicking the Nazi salute.

The dog is also seen watching a Hitler rally during the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin. The dog appears to raise its paw when Hitler proclaims “Sieg Heil.”

“Who’s a good wee Nazi?” Meechan praised the dog.

The video ricocheted around the Internet and has now been viewed more than 3 million times. Some found it amusing; others feel it was crude and anti-Semitic, including a woman who Meechan says confronted him, then spread dog feces on his front door.

Prosecutors say it’s a hate crime.

That April, soon after the video was posted, police knocked on Meechan’s door in Coatbridge, a town in North Lanarkshire, Scotland, he told Alex Jones. The officers told him that he was being charged with a hate crime and that the video could be seen as promoting violence against Jews. They told him to change his clothes, took pictures of his apartment and hauled him off to jail.

He spent a night there and is now on trial for violating the Communications Act of 2003, which prohibits using public telecommunications to send discriminatory religious messages. The trial started Monday.

Prosecutors allege that Meechan communicated material that would cause fear and alarm and stir up hatred on religious grounds by posting a clip on YouTube that was “anti-Semitic in nature,” according to the Telegraph.

He also faces an alternative charge of posting a video on social media and YouTube that was grossly offensive because it was “anti-Semitic and racist in nature.” The prosecutors say the act was aggravated by religious prejudice, a claim Meechan disputes.

“I feel in the long run I didn’t do anything wrong,” he said on Jones’s show. “It was clearly satire. It was clearly a joke. I wasn’t setting out to cause any offense to any people. If anything I was wanting people to laugh and just obviously, it was taken the wrong way.”

Meechan didn’t immediately respond to messages from The Washington Post seeking comment. He said that he could see how people could be offended by his video but that he doesn’t “think hurting someone’s feelings is a crime.”

Ephraim Borowski, director of the Scottish Council of Jewish Communities, argued that the video is indeed a hate crime, according to the Telegraph.

“It is grossly offensive. It stuns me that anyone should think it is a joke,” Borowski told the court, saying he had family that died in the Holocaust.

“My immediate reaction is that there is a clear distinction to be made between an offhand remark and the amount of effort that is required to train a dog like that. I actually feel sorry for the dog.”

And Borowski told the court that there were real-world consequences: The council was “bombarded with” 160 pages of anti-Semitic messages supporting Meechan and the video.

[An assistant principal wrote a children’s book about alt-right mascot Pepe the frog. It cost him his job.]

In a Q&A with the Connecticut Jewish Ledger, Gavriel Rosenfeld warned that Hitler- and Nazi-based satire normalizes the Nazi legacy:

The Internet above all is the medium that really focuses on Hitler as a completely decontextualized, dehistoricized figure. We can draw a Hitler mustache on anything or a swastika on anything and start laughing at it. When Hitler himself is photoshopped into the form of various other characters, we get into some really bizarre phenomena: catsthatlooklikehitler.com or thingsthatlooklikehitler.com or “Hipster Hitler” or “Six Degrees of Hitler” — it’s a cottage industry of people exploiting his image to get attention but we’re far away from any historical lesson.

The Scotsman reported in July that there was a record number of anti-Semitic attacks in Scotland in 2016. The paper wrote that of the 26 anti-Semitic crimes last year, 15 resulted in criminal charges, while a further 19 “non-criminal” anti-Semitic incidents also took place.

Meechan has posted a video apologizing for any offense the video caused.

He stressed that he hated “racism in any way shape or form. … I don’t have any ill will towards the Jewish community or anything like that at all.”

But he’d already defended his actions in a succinct statement on his pug-centered video: “I’m not racist, by the way. I just really, really wanted to p— (my girlfriend) off.”

"Adam W. Purinton admits that he murdered Kuchibhotla.

A year after Indian informational technology professional Srinivas Kuchibhotla was shot dead by a white nationalist, in an apparent hate crime, at a bar in Olathe, Kansas, the accused, Adam W. Purinton, has accepted his guilt of “premeditated” assault on Kuchibhotla and his friend Alok Madasani, who was injured.

Purinton, a US Navy veteran, entered Austin’s Bar and Grill in Olathe, where the two Indian nationals were having an after-work break and yelled at them, “Get out of my country!” and fired.

According to the indictment report, Purinton committed the crime after substantial planning and premeditation and, in addition to shooting the two victims, he risked the lives of others present in the bar.

ALSO READ: Killer asked Kuchibhotla and Madasani what visas were they on: report

Besides Kuchibhotla and Madasani, a patron, Ian Grillot, also sustained bullet injury when he tried to protect the victims.

Both Kuchibhotla and Madasani came to the United States as students and worked as engineers at Garmin, a US firm company that specializes in GPS technology.

The sentencing will be on May 4. Purinton, who was found guilty of premeditated first-degree murder, could be slapped with a life in prison with no chance of parole for the next 50 years

“Today’s guilty verdict in the murder of my husband will not bring back my Srinu, but it will send a strong message that hate is not acceptable. We must understand and love each other,” wrote Sunayana Dumala, wife of Srinivas Kuchibhotla.

Dumala submitted a written statement as she could not be present during the court proceedings on Tuesday. “Please join me on -March 9, Srivnu’s birthday – to peacefully walk together in his memory,” she wrote. “Let us continue to work for peace, understanding and love the things Srinu stood for and will be his legacy.”

According to court documents, Purinton entered the bar on February 22, and made some derogatory comments on the two Indians who were having a leisurely drink. Purinton was removed from the scene but a few minutes later he came back to the bar with a firearm and fired at the two yelling “Get out of My Country!”

The killing of Kuchibhotla had sparked fear within the Indian American community over their safety.

Purinton, who fled the scene in his car after opening fire, drove 70 miles before stopping at a restaurant in the neighboring Missouri. He confessed his crime to a bartender, who informed the local law enforcement agency.

ALSO READ: Who is Srinivas Kuchibhotla?

According to the statement given by the staff of Austin’s Bar and Grill, Purinton was a regular customer and he became an alcoholic after the death of his father, which had affected him physically and mentally for two years.

Purinton, who is 52, will spend rest of his life in prison if he is spared of death penalty for the hate crime charges, which is pending with federal authorities.

Johnson County court’s plea agreement doesn’t involve hate crime as it is a federal case, which carries a possible death sentence.

"AURORA, Colo. -- A couple in Aurora is shaken after waking up early Friday morning to find swastikas spray-painted on their home. Police are now investigating the incident as a bias-motivated crime.

Sandy and Howard Wolf were woken up to the sound of a door knock at around 6 a.m. Friday. On the other side of the door was an officer with the Aurora Police Department, who had been called to the home after a neighbor reported seeing a large swastika spray-painted on their garage door and a smaller one on their mailbox.



My husband and I took a trip to Poland and Israel last year and we were in several concentration camps so it just really hit hard to see that on our home, such hatred, said Sandy Wolf. We hear about lots of things but now it’s happened here.”

The couple says they have no idea why they were targeted, or how the vandal knew they were Jewish.

I was so stunned at first and I think I said something like, who could’ve done such a thing?” said one of the Wolfs. I started crying I was almost paralyzed, I would say.”

Howard Wolf, who has relatives that were killed in the Holocaust, said theyre still trying to figure out why someone would target them specifically.

As the day has gone on I think that emotion is still there, but it has also been coupled with anger, he said.



A relative of the Wolfs took to Facebook after finding out about the crime, saying she will take the incident and use to educate her daughters about what happened, hoping to turn anger into action.

We will talk about acceptance and love - not just tolerance but respect for and welcoming of others who are different from ourselves into our community. I ask you to do the same with the kids in your life, she said.

A 2016 Anti-Defamation League audit identified 29 cases of harassment and threats against Jewish people, 15 cases of vandalism and one physical assault on a Jewish individual here in Colorado.

So far this year, there have been four reported cases where swastikas have popped up in Colorado.

On January 3, State Rep. Jonathan Si found a Longmont park vandalized with swastikas. Days later, people who live near Glenmere Park in Greeley were shocked to find two swastikas traced into the snow on the park’s frozen lake. Then, on May 3, swastikas and other symbols of hate were found carved into cars near DU. That same week, firefighters found swastikas carved into a freshly poured concrete sidewalk in Westminster.

Police told Denver7 there is no suspect information at this time. They also said no other homes were targeted with vandalism overnight.

You never think it will happen to you. I never thought it would happen to someone I love. Ive read the news broadcasting the tragic and unnecessary deaths due to hate, and I felt sad for their families, and angry at the perpetrators. I wanted equal rights, justice, and change but it wasn’t long before their loss became a distant memory. On Aug. 12, my family lost one of our own, my cousin, Heather Heyer when she stood up against hate and bigotry.

Heather was not a part of Antifa, the anti-fascist organization that shows up at protests all over. Heather was just like you and me, a concerned citizen who along with many other Charlottesville, Va., residents said, “No. Were not OK with neo-Nazis and white supremacists in our streets. Were not going to turn a blind eye, and pretend like today is normal.”

Neo-Nazis were flooding the streets of Charlottesville, going past people’s homes, places of business, threatening and intimidating places of prayer. Were Charlottesville residents supposed to leave town for the weekend? Turn their lights off? Hide in basements and attics?

Fighting hate: She wanted to put down hate: Heather Heyer remembered in Charlottesville

Notable moments: Trumps defense of his Charlottesville statement

Instead Charlottesville residents took to the streets in counter protest to protect their community peacefully. Both sides are not equally responsible for Charlottesville. To believe that is disrespectful to Heather, and it’s disrespectful to the many lives lost due to Nazis, the KKK and other groups that spread a similar hateful message.

The young man charged with killing Heather was impassioned by the violent rhetoric of the white nationalists. He was fulfilling their call to action. He was trying to silence the counter-protestors and to invoke fear in those who stand against the white nationalist rhetoric.

I don’t want this in my country. I don’t want this in Indiana. I don’t want this on my streets. The Indiana I know welcomes all people willing to live civilly. We need to send a clear message to those who choose hate that we do not tolerate violence or intimidation in any form. They are not welcome here. We will not let them intimidate us, our friends, our neighbors, our colleagues, or our families. We will not let them intimidate the stranger in the grocery store.

Yet, there is no hate crime law Indiana. When the government fails the people its sworn to protect, hate groups are emboldened to spread hate, intimidate and threaten violence under the guise of free speech. A lot of people seem to be confused about something that I want to straighten out now. Intimidation and threatening violence are not protected rights. Do not confuse them with “the right of the people peaceably to assemble.”

Get on your phones, get on your email, send letters, join peaceful protests. Tell your state representative to support House Speaker Brian Bosma’s efforts to enact hate crime legislation in Indiana.

It doesn’t end there. Getting a hate crime law passed is just one step of many that Indiana needs to take to combat the hate-fueled sickness that has reared its ugly head. This is just the beginning of an uphill battle that is going to take all of Indiana’s peaceful residents, not just supporters of one political party. Hate is not a partisan issue. Do not make room for white nationalism by being complicit. There is no room for hate in our state. We cannot be complacent.

"A former New York substitute teacher faces hate crime charges after he allegedly yanked the hijab off the head of an 8-year-old Muslim girl in his second-grade class, law enforcement officials said.

Oghenetega Edah, 31, surrendered to authorities this week following the May 2 incident at an elementary school in The Bronx, New York, that garnered international headlines. Police said Edah allegedly ordered the 8-year-old at P.S. 76 to remove her religious headscarf as punishment for sitting in his chair, the New York Daily News reported.

“If you don’t behave, I’m going to take your scarf off,” Edah told the child, according to court papers filed in Bronx Criminal Court on Thursday.

The young girl, who Vocativ is not naming, then told her teacher she was not allowed to remove her hijab because her Muslim faith prevented her from doing so, and that other people weren’t allowed to see her hair. But Edah paid no regard to his pupil’s pleas, prosecutors said.

“I want to see your hair,” he allegedly said before ripping the headscarf off the student.

The city’s Department of Education fired Edah the next day after learning of the girl’s accusations. Prosecutors are now seeking to charged Edah with endangering the welfare of a child and aggravated harassment, which is considered a hate crime.",1
"BOCA RATON, Fla. - After an investigation, Palm Beach County Sheriffs Office said Wednesday that it doesnt believe a recent assault on a Muslim student was a hate crime.

The case garnered national attention after a video of the fight was published on social media. The video shows a group of teenage girls beating a 14-year-old West Boca High School student.

Deputies said they interviewed the suspects about the Dec. 21 fight at Sunset Cove Amphitheatre Park. They also met West Boca Raton High School officials.

“All participants agreed the fight was over a boy and a video that was circulated, the sheriffs office said in a statement. All parties agreed to meet and to fight and a specific location and time. There is no evidence of a hate crime.”

The sheriffs office said the girls could face charges of simple battery.

The girls father, Shakeel Munshi, had said earlier that his daughter was targeted because she is Muslim.

Omar Saleh, a civil right attorney for the Council on Islamic Relations, said his organization has accepted the findings of the sheriffs office, but said the assault is still disturbing.

Whether it was over a boy or religiously motivated, based on what weve seen on the video the actions are atrocious, Saleh said.

As we mourn the loss of the twenty-six souls murdered in cold blood; as we pray for the 20 recovering from gun-shot wounds, 10 in critical condition, we are outraged at the circumstances. A man dishonorably discharged from the military for abusing his wife and child; a man who nonetheless passes a background check and purchases an AR-556 rifle—that man sprays the church where his wife’s mother and grandmother attend and kills 26 people and wounds 20 more.

This set of circumstances calls for more than praying for the victims. This set of circumstances causes us to look squarely at the connection between domestic violence and gun violence.

Last month, our nation was whipsawed by mass murder in Las Vegas and mass predations in Hollywood.

The proximity of the Harvey Weinstein revelations to the Vegas massacre was certainly opportune for the NRA, a welcomed distraction from the heightened post-tragedy scrutiny on gun legislation. For a fleeting moment, Congress had seemed poised to take at least minimal action to address the absurdity of our country’s gun laws.

But within days, with salacious revelations of Weinstein’s predatory behavior toward women, sexual harassment and sexual assault took the news cycle. For too long, powerful men have abused their power to degrade and harass women not only in Hollywood but in schools and workplaces across the nation, in politics, in academia and even in seminary, for God’s sake.

The Weinstein story awakened a tsunami of personal revelations about sexual harassment and abuse ― a reality so deeply entrenched in our culture that few women have been spared (#metoo and us, too). The problem transcends geography, class, age and race. We are black, brown and white, Christian, Sikh and Jewish. All three of us have experienced repeated sexual harassment and/or abuse, and we have all witnessed gender-based violence in our immediate communities. One of us survived assault with a gun.

These days we’re used to racing from one outrage to the next, daily if not hourly. But these two man-made disasters—gun violence and sexual violence—must not divert our attention from one to the other. They are fundamentally linked and must be addressed with the same moral clarity and commitment.

Sexual violence and gun violence are twin cancerous growths from the same abhorrent root – a culture that fetishizes violence and power, ignores sexual harassment and lionizes sexual abusers, elevating repeat offenders and unrepentant predators to the heads of corporations and universities, to the Supreme Court and the Oval Office. None of this would be possible without the silence and complicity that has made our country unsafe for women and girls, non-binary folks, and many men and boys, too.

To be sure, the victims in Las Vegas were not targeted because they were women, nor, does it seem, were the victims in Sutherland Springs, Texas. But was anyone surprised to hear reports that the Las Vegas shooter was known to publicly shame and humiliate his girlfriend? And are we surprised to hear the violent history of this shooter?

We are long overdue for a national conversation about the prevalence of sexual and domestic abusers.

The Orlando Pulse Club shooter abused his ex-wife before gunning down 29 people.

The Virginia Tech shooter was known to harass female students before he shot and killed 32 people.

The Sandy Hook shooter murdered his mother before gunning down a kindergarten classroom of 20 children and 6 adults.

And there’s more. Every 16 hours, a woman in America is fatally shot by her partner. Domestic violence victims are five times more likely to be killed if their abuser has access to a gun, and research shows simply living in a state with high gun ownership increases a woman’s risk of being fatally shot in a domestic violence incident.

It’s time we name the connection between intimidation, humiliation and harassment of women and violence against women and other people. We need to talk about the ways that our culture’s sanctification of male power leads inexorably to violence, including domestic abuse and murder.

Perhaps the proximity of these three horrifying American tragedies will finally be a wake-up call for our soul-weary nation. It’s up to us to ignite a national conversation now, to ensure that when the next moral outrage strikes—no doubt any hour now—both gun violence and sexual violence will remain at the forefront of the public consciousness until we’ve built a truly safe, dignified and just society for all.

"HOWELL NJ -- (Updated, noon Tuesday) A pair of brothers have been charged with shooting at a man who was yelling at a woman the parking lot of Countryside Apartments Monday evening, Howell Police Chief Andrew Kudrick said Tuesday. Lloyd Gomes, 29, and Ramano Gomes, 28, who live together on North American Drive, Howell, are both charged with possession of a weapon for unlawful purposes and are being held at the Monmouth County Correctional Institute, Freehold Township, in lieu of $75,000 bail, no 10 percent option, each, Kudrick said. The man they are accused of shooting at has been charged with domestic violence-related harassment in the incident that happened about 8:15 p.m., Kudrick said. The man is not being identified to protect the privacy of the woman hes accused of harassing, Sgt. Christian Antunez said. Police were called to North American Drive in the complex off West Farms Road after residents reported hearing a tractor trailer had hit apartment buildings, Kudrick said, followed by gunshots, possibly aimed at the tractor trailer. Police officers who responded soon determined the truck was a box truck, not a tractor trailer, and that the box truck had hit cars in the parking lot, he said. The investigation determined there had been an dispute where a man was outside yelling at a woman who lived in one of the apartments, Kudrick said. The disruption from the mans screaming led two neighbors, now identified as the Gomes brothers, to confront the man, he said. The Gomeses did not know the man and they are not related, Kudrick said. The confrontation led to the man getting into a large box truck and in his attempt to get away, hit cars in the parking lot. One of the cars hit was registered to Lloyd Gomes, Antunez said. The Gomeses then fired several shots from handguns at man through the truck. The man was not hit and fled the scene, Kudrick said. There were no reported injuries, he said. The box truck was ultimately found near Freehold Raceway Mall by Freehold Township police and the driver was arrested and charged with domestic violence harassment offenses related to the dispute with the woman, Kudrick said. The Gomeses, witnesses and the man were then brought in for questioning regarding the shooting, which remains under investigation, he said.

This time of year is very significant for me because it is usually around the time of year when I start shedding. Shedding meaning preparing for growth by breaking up with behaviors, assignments, strategies and in some cases people.

I have learned in my almost seven years of entrepreneurship that growth requires reflection and change. What I’m really saying is that BOSS women really have to make some tough decisions.

It’s easy to make a decision when there is a clear right vs. wrong scenario. However, decision-making becomes more difficult when you have to make right vs. right decisions.

These are the decisions in which you have to choose what is right for you vs. what is fair to someone else. In many cases these decisions are tough.

For example, when you have to walk away from a marriage because your needs have never been met; fire an underperforming employee that you have a close personal relationship with; walk away from a business partnership that is draining and one-sided; or ditch your current mastermind group because you need to surround yourself with people who will push you further in your area of need – these decisions are never easy.

In any case, it would be nice and loyal to hang in there for the other party, but you have to HONOR YOURSELF too! There is a strategy for making Right vs. Right decisions according to the Harvard Business Journal.

The questions that you should ask yourself when you’re making difficult decisions are:

1. What action allows me to do the most good with the least amount of harm? In most cases this can be concluded by making a list of everyone that the decision will affect along with everything they could lose or gain as a result of the decision.

2. Identify who has rights in the situation that cannot be violated.

3. What message do you want to send about what you and your business stand for as a result of this decision?

4. What’s the best response to this situation in the world as it is? This means that based on the worldview and systems of today, which response is better?

As a BOSS woman, tough decisions require a level head and a close look at the facts. You must understand that how you make tough decisions allow people an inside view of who you really are, how much they can trust you and also how to do business or handle you going forward.

So, asking yourself all four questions (the system does not have the same effect when all four are not included) is necessary to help make tough (right vs. right) decisions.

The final step is to test your decision by asking:

1 Would this decision work if it was frontpage news tomorrow?

2 If my children were the ones being affected, is this the way that I would want them to be treated?

3 From a long-term prospective, am I handling this issue correctly?

Ask yourself the tough questions to make these tough decisions – and most importantly, pray for direction so God can lead you to do what honors Him most.

"Police are looking for a man accused of giving a fake check to a Hopkins landlord, according to charging documents filed Tuesday. Landlord Rod Galvin told police that 29-year-old Edward David Stahlmann gave his son-in-law a $2,400 rent check on April 13 that was later returned as fraudulent, Police Officer Raymond Laudenbach wrote in the charging documents. When Laudenbach talked with the bank, it said the logo and design were inconsistent with the actual design and logo. The routing number on the check also went to a different bank. Stahlmann moved in April 16. Galvin learned about the fake check while he was in Iowa. By the time he returned to Minnesota, Stahlmann had left the property. Police looked for Stahlmann at his parents North St. Paul home, but his mother said he no longer lived with them and that she didnt know where he was.

"Since the election of Donald Trump, the Demo/MSM insists that he is the inspiration for hatred, all the talk of America being a society steeped in “white privilege” and racist nationalism. Thus, one might expect to see hate crime statistics support such claims. But they imply just the opposite.

The FBI has released its “hate crimes” data for the year 2016. Now, as we have argued in the past, the designation of “hate crime” injects a rather subjective standard into motivating factors for crime and it’s often used to artificially increase the level of guilt beyond the actual criminal act. Often hate crimes are not recorded as such because they are black on white. Moreover, leftist “social justice warriors” implicate the criminal’s entire social, religious or racial group, so long as it’s white or Christian. But for the sake of argument, let’s accept the FBI’s designation and look at some things.

According to the data, over the past decade the total number of reported hate crimes has changed very little, with anti-black crimes remaining the highest reported percentage at 50.2%. However, over that same period there has been a significant shift in the percentage of white offenders. In 2007 — before the Age of Hope ‘n’ Change™ — nearly 63% of all known offenders were white; by 2016 and the rise of that big “hater” Donald Trump, that percentage had dropped to 46.3%. (That is bad news for the hate hustling profiteers.) And while the percentage of white offenders has decreased, the percentage of anti-white crime saw an increase in 2016 to 20.5%, the highest level recorded since 2006.

It’s not surprising to see an uptick in the number of anti-white hate crimes, since those who have been widely demonized by politically motivated leftists will tend to see a greater backlash against them by other groups who feel newly justified in their anger. Notably, the number of hate-crime hoaxes is also on the rise…

Finally, one interesting stat not noted by the FBI were the number of crimes committed against politicians, particularly of the Republican variety. With all the rhetoric about Trump and Republicans supposedly fomenting hatred, it was Republicans who were violently attacked this past year, specifically when a Bernie Sanders-supporting leftist targeted and shot GOP House members practicing for a baseball game. And more recently there is Sen. Rand Paul, who is sporting six broken ribs after a blindside attack at the hands of his leftist neighbor. Are we the only ones detecting a pattern here?",1
"LAWRENCEVILLE, GA — A Gwinnett County Police officer on Friday shot a man after the suspect fired shots at officers during a chase, authorities say. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is looking into the incident, which started in north Gwinnett and ended in Hall County. According to police spokeswoman Cpl. Michele Pihera, an officer recognized a man with active felony warrants for his arrest on Buford Highway near Hamlton Mill Road. The officer tried to stop the mans car, a purple Ford Escort, but he refused to stop and fled, leading officers on a chase. During the chase, the man pointed a gun out of his car window and fired toward officers, Pihera said. The chase ended on Friendship Road near Highway 211 in the city of Braselton. As the man was driving on the wrong side of the road and approaching oncoming traffic, an officer performed a PIT maneuver, causing the Escort to spin out. After his car spun around, the man pulled a gun, Pihera said. One of the officers fired at the man through his drivers side car window. It was unclear how many times the officer fired, but the suspect suffered injuries to his jaw and hand. Pihera said its unclear whether the officers shot hit the suspect, or if the man injured himself. The man was taken to a local hospital, where he was listed Friday in stable condition. The GBI, as is customary in officer-involved shootings, will look into the case. Agents were on the scene of the shooting Friday. Photo courtesy Gwinnett County Police Department",0
"Adam Purinton, now faces criminal counts in federal court in the February fatal shooting of an Indian man in eastern Kansas. Photo courtesy KSHB

June 10 (UPI) -- A Kansas man accused of killing one Indian national and attempting to kill another in a bar in Olathe, Kan. now faces federal hate crime charges.

Adam W. Purinton, 52, already faces a count of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted first-degree murder in Johnson County. Now the Olathe man can receive the death penalty through proceedings in federal court.

A news release from the U.S. Justice Department accuses Purinton of killing Srinivas Kuchibhotla and trying to kill Alok Madasani, both of India, because of their actual and perceived race, color, religion and national origin.

The release, published Friday, said Purinton carried out the attacks after substantial planning and premeditation.

Witnesses have said Purinton yelled slurs at Kuchibhotla and Madasani at an Olathe bar on Feb. 22. Both men were engineers from India and worked at the nearby headquarters for technology company Garmin.

According to Johnson County court documents obtained by the Kansas City Star, Purinton was kicked out of the bar, came back about 30 minutes later with a gun and opened fire -- shooting the two men and another man, Ian Grillot, who intervened.

He was arrested hours later in Missouri.

"Prompted by the recent events in Charlottesville, Virginia, the American College of Physicians (ACP) took a position recognizing hate crimes as a Public Health issue. In its policy statement, the ACP sees an important role for physicians to educate the public that hate crimes are a Public Health concern, exacting a toll on the health of those directly victimized and on the health of entire communities.

When we see reports in the news, of attacks motivated by hate, such as mass shootings and other hate-related crimes, it stirs emotions and grabs our attention. And, like most Public Health issues, the number of reported injuries and deaths linked to bigotry, hate and discrimination is just the tip of the iceberg. We know from experience that the vast majority of the damaging health impacts, such as depression, hypertension, stress, cardiovascular disease and even death, often hide below the surface of our public consciousness. Declaring hate as a Public Health issue is not an overreaction nor is it an exaggeration of the mental and physical problems that can result from victimization.

Treating hate-based violence as a Public Health concern allows us to apply the same tools we have successfully used to stop the spread of infections and reduce the impacts of disease and injury for decades. Our country has the resources and capacity to address this Public Health crisis but much like quitting smoking, or losing weight, the big question is do we have the will power to tackle it as a disease, or will we just keep waiting for the next magic pill to treat the symptoms?

The Ohio Public Health Association joins the ACP, the American Medical Association, the American Public Health Association and others in the clinical and Public Health professions, who have taken a stand to oppose prejudice, discrimination, harassment and violence against individuals based on their race, ethnic origin, ancestry, gender, gender identity, nationality, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, cultural background, age, disability or religion. The door is open for others to join us.

"LAKE COUNTY, IL -- A Grayslake mom claims a Round Lake police officer used excessive force when she shot and killed her son last year and has now filed a federal lawsuit against the veteran officer and the village of Round Lake, the Daily Herald reports. The lawsuit, filed by the attorneys for Arona Musson on Friday, states Round Lake Police Department officer Valerie Liss willfully and wantonly (used) unreasonable, excessive, unjustified, and deadly force when she fatally shot Michael Musson on Sept. 2, 2016. The suit is seeking unspecified punitive and compensatory damages, according to the Daily Herald. The lawsuit comes weeks after the Lake County States Attorney determined Liss, a 13-year veteran of the Round Lake Police Department, used reasonable force when she shot and killed Musson, 22, of Grayslake. An investigation into the incident revealed Musson took acid earlier in the evening and was apparently attempting to break into condominiums when Liss responded to the scene on MacGillis Drive. He violently attacked Liss, which lead to her firing her gun at Musson, according to a report released in July by Lake County States Attorney Michael G. Nerheim. At one point during the attack, Musson, who was 6 feet tall and weighed 190 pounds, charged the officer, who is 5-feet 5-inches tall and weighs 155 pounds, and slammed his body into hers, which then knocked her to the sidewalk. Nerheims findings concluded that Liss only fired her gun and shot Musson after she determined her life, and the life of a witness who came to her aid, were in danger.  More via the Daily Herald",0

"EU citizens campaign for their right to stay in the UK after Brexit Jack Taylor / Getty

LONDON - In the aftermath of the vote to leave the European Union in June last year, Theresa May was urged by the Labour party and others to unilaterally guarantee the rights of EU citizens living in Britain.

The prime minister chose not to, leaving many of the 3 million EU citizens that currently live and work in the UK feeling uncertain and, in some cases, fearful for their future.

And for some of those campaigning on the issue, this decision, has even put EU citizens in physical danger.

Speaking to Business Insider, Nicolas Hatton, the founder of the3million, a pressure group, said the prime ministers decision had created the perfect conditions for the rise in hate crime.

Following the referendum, they should have guaranteed our rights straight away on the 24th June 2016. That wasnt done, and as a result, there is no clear signal on whether we are here to stay, Hatton told BI.

That created the perfect conditions for the rise in hate crimes, which is really really regrettable. This was the one opportunity that was missed.

Hate crimes based on race or religion peaked after the EU referendum, and the Home Office admitted that the statistics reflected a genuine rise in hate crime around the time of the EU referendum.

Some EU citizens believe the blame lies at the door of the Home Office and Downing Street.

Dalia, a 22-year-old Polish citizen told BI that Brexit has meant so many peoples rights and therefore lives have been suddenly threatened.

When so many peoples rights and therefore lives are suddenly threatened, the kind of exploitation recently attested to by maltreated employees, as well as the hostile attitudes of the Home Office towards those who have contributed to this country for years, are a natural consequence of the unclear stance of the current political leadership on this issue, she said.

Discrimination

Some EU citizens now say they feel discriminated against when applying for jobs and housing.

A report published by the3million in August documented evidence that EU jobseekers are now being asked for proof of British or Irish citizenship before being considered as potential employees or tenants.

Blomfield said: I think that the uncertainty has added to the discrimination against EU nationals. When we saw the evidence of discrimination, it was in many cases because those responsible were uncertain what rights EU nationals had.

Trade union leader and general secretary of the TUC, Frances OGrady, told BI: Its a big worry that so many of them say they are starting to feel unwelcome. There is no excuse for the government to leave them living in limbo, not knowing with any certainty on what terms they will be able to stay in the place they have made home.

Nearly a million Brits living and working in the rest of Europe need the same certainty.

The opposition agree. Labours shadow Brexit minister Paul Blomfield told BI that the government has used EU citizens as bargaining chips and leverage in negotiations.

They have been fairly clear that they saw the negotiations over citizens rights as providing them with bargaining chips and leverage. Ministers have said as much. We obviously thought that was wrong, we successfully move a motion in the House of Commons last July saying that we should give unilateral and unconditional rights to those who are already here, and we were confident that that would lead to reciprocity for the rights of the 1.2 million Brits in Europe.

OGrady, in particular, is clear of the impact of EU nationals on the UK: EU workers are an important part of Britains workforce. They make a tremendous contribution to public services like the NHS, and to many firms, from our larger corporations down to family businesses.

Beyond the human disruption and upset, it will damage our economy and public services if we lose these valued friends, colleagues and neighbours.

Citizens rights is one of the three key issues the EU has insisted must be at least partially resolved before Brexit negotiations, alongside Northern Ireland and the financial settlement.

May and her government have sought to reassure EU citizens that their rights will not be affected, with the prime minister writing an open letter to all three million in October declaring I couldnt be clearer: EU citizens living lawfully in the UK today will be able to stay.

However, the government has still stopped short of unilaterally declaring that EU citizens will continue to have the same rights, which has meant the confusion over the direction of immigration policy has continued.

Ongoing uncertainty

In July 2016, two weeks after the UK voted to leave the EU, the House of Commons overwhelmingly passed a Labour motion that called on the government to guarantee rights for European citizens in Britain.

Labour shadow minister Emily Thornberry called the governments inaction on citizens rights outrage in moral terms and that it had cast a shadow over the futures of millions.

Five Conservative MPs voted with the opposition on the motion, including Boris Johnson, yet no action was taken, and Theresa May, then the home secretary, was absent from the debate.

16 months on from the referendum, and there still has not been a guarantee from the government. Hatton said: I think theyve started really badly.

Following the referendum, they should have guaranteed our rights straight away on the 24th June 2016. That wasnt done, and as a result, there is no clear signal on whether we are here to stay.

He added: That created the perfect conditions for the rise in hate crimes, which is really really regrettable. This was the one opportunity that was missed.

We dont trust the Home Office

In August the Home Office mistakenly sent more than 100 letters to EU citizens living in the UK, telling them to leave the country or face possible deportation.

May called it an unfortunate error and the Home Office apologised.

We are contacting everyone who received this letter to clarify that they can disregard it. We are absolutely clear that the rights of EU nationals living in the UK remain unchanged, a spokesperson said.

In September, proposals to drastically reduce immigration after Brexit were leaked, with the plans suggesting EU nationals might be forced to use work permits and get ID cards in order to stay in Britain.

When asked whether he trusts the Home Office, Hatton is blunt: At the moment, the answer is no.

I think that they have proven in the past that they cannot really be trusted with the lives of people. And the 99% of law-abiding citizens should not be fearing the rules of the Home Office.

Dalia said the Home Office has a hostile attitude towards those who have contributed to this country for years.

Since the Brexit referendum EU citizens have felt in danger of having their rights changed or being told to leave, and the government are just adding to our confusion.

Blomfield told BI: The government see EU nationals here essentially as a burden, as people who are fortunate to be here, who should be grateful for what they should get.

Whats the answer?

Protestors rally outside Parliament to campaign for EU citizens rights. Jack Taylor / Getty Labour believe that a unilateral guarantee for EU citizens should have been made long ago, but would also have an impact if made now.

Blomfield said this is: On the grounds that was the right thing to do. Both for the 3 million here, but also for the 1.2 million Brits in Europe.

OGrady agrees: The solution is simple. The government should do the right thing and give them a clear promise that they can stay with full citizens rights, regardless of the course of Brexit negotiations.

Hatton said the3million want a very strong bilateral agreement on citizens rights, that cant be undone by laws.

He added: Wed like the British government to become more serious about the rights of EU citizens and engage with us in open dialogue. We have proposals, very solid policy that we think would work for every single EU citizen here. 

Brexit Secretary David Davis has not met with the group, neither have junior government ministers, yet the organisation has been allowed to discuss their issues with Labours shadow Brexit team and the EUs chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.

Hatton said: Its for the government to take the offer to speak to us. Like them, weve got the same objective, to break the deadlock. If only they would speak to us and listen to our proposals, maybe they would then find a way out of the current deadlock and progress to phase 2 of negotiations.",1

"LA MESA, CA – Students, community members and activists marched from Helix Charter High School to La Mesa Police Department headquarters Wednesday to protest the actions of a police officer who twice slammed a handcuffed female student to the ground while arresting her last week at the University Avenue campus. Video of the rough law enforcement encounter emerged on social media over the weekend, sparking a student walkout Monday morning protesting the treatment of the 17-year-girl. The teen sustained scratches on her face during the scuffle on Friday afternoon but did not require hospital care due to the encounter, authorities said. La Mesa police officials have promised to conduct a thorough review. On Tuesday, the department announced that the involved lawman, school-resource Officer Scott Wulfing, was reassigned to another division and would not work on any campuses pending completion of an internal investigation. Wulfing has been a member of the agency for nine years, LMPD Lt. Chad Bell said. Aeiramique Blake, a community organizer serving as a spokesperson for the family of the arrested girl, contended that temporarily reassigning the officer was not enough. Were asking that he is suspended, Blake said in a Facebook video, noting that Wednesday afternoons protest march was meant to put police on notice -- we know the officer was reassigned, not suspended. During the earlier school walkout, Blake said Wulfing never needs to work with kids again. In her social-media video, she called for Helix High and all other area secondary schools to eventually pull all resource officers off campus. She also called on the countys top prosecutor to review the incident. (District Attorney) Summer Stephan, we will come for you if you do not press charges against this officer, Blake said. The clash between Wulfing and the student, according to La Mesa police Chief Walt Vasquez, happened after a Helix High staffer called police for assistance to deal with the student, who was suspended and refused orders to leave the school grounds. Wulfing tried in vain to get the girl to leave voluntarily before forcibly tackling and handcuffing her, Vasquez said. As they were walking, the student became non-compliant on two separate occasions and made an attempt to free herself by pulling away from the officer, the chief asserted in a prepared statement. To prevent the student from escaping, the officer forced the student to the ground. The Facebook videos show Wulfing twice throwing the girl across his body from left to right and onto the concrete-paved ground. Following the first slam, the girl appears to lean away from the officer, after which he throws her down again and pins her with his upper body for several seconds, then rolls her to her side and pulls her to her feet. After the student agreed to quit resisting and attempting to escape, the officer assisted her up and walked her to his patrol vehicle, Vasquez said. Blake disputed the official rationale for the arrest, saying the girl had been allowed to be on campus while assigned to in-school suspension for tardiness issues. According to Blake, a teacher accused the girl of being intoxicated, then searched her backpack, finding no drugs but discovering pepper spray, which the teen said she carried for protection. The instructor told her shed have to leave campus because she was carrying a weapon, then called the police when she refused, Blake said. No matter what was done or not done, that was not the appropriate way to handle a young lady, Blake said. The community is completely outraged. The school is expected to hold a community forum before the end of the month.    RELATED: By City News Service Photo via YouTube screenshot",0
"Nearly two dozen Utah religious leaders are urging the Utah Legislature to pass SB86, which would enhance penalties for hate-driven crimes against people or property.

Under the bill, sponsored by state Sen. Daniel Thatcher, R-West Valley City, punishment for a class A misdemeanor could be meted out at a harsher, third-degree-felony level if the crime targeted a person based on “ancestry, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, national origin, race, religion or sexual orientation.”

The letter, with 23 signatories representing Catholic, Episcopal, Protestant, Unitarian, Islamic and Jewish congregations, was written by the Rev. Oscar A. Solis, bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Salt Lake City.

On Wednesday, the left-leaning Alliance for a Better Utah voiced its support for the letter.

“The rate of hate crimes across the country has risen since the last time this legislation was introduced, and as such we see a clear need for swift action from the Legislature,” Josh Kanter, the alliance’s chairman and founder, said in a news release. “We have been told by our trusted law enforcement that the status quo of hate crimes law is ineffective in Utah. It is time we listen to the legal experts and faith leaders and pass SB86.”

In the Jan. 15 letter, drafted for a Martin Luther King Jr. Day of Prayer and Action to End Racism event, Solis noted that FBI data showed 47 racially based crimes in Utah in 2013.

“Swastikas are now showing up as public graffiti across the nation,” the bishop stated. “Muslim women are afraid to wear headscarves for fear of being assaulted. A bomb threat closed the [I.J. & Jeanné] Wagner Jewish Community Center in Salt Lake City.”

Solis added: “These events, and countless others like them, perpetrated against single individuals and entire communities, are tragic and are alarming to those of us in the faith community.”

In an aside appealing directly to the Mormon majority in Utah — and on Capitol Hill — the Catholic bishop referred to the slain founder of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

“The not-so-subtle message [of a hate crime] is simple: You don’t belong here, go somewhere else. That was the same message Mormons got from 19th-century mobs in Missouri and Illinois: [LDS Church founder] Joseph Smith and [his brother] Hyrum Smith were murdered because of their religion.”

The LDS Church was not a signatory to the letter and has taken no position on SB86. Kanter noted that the measure would help protect entire communities, including Mormons, from hate-driven threats and attacks.

Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune Sen. Daniel W. Thatcher speaks from the floor in the Senate on Wednesday, Aug. 19, 2015.

Thatcher’s effort to launch similar legislation last year was derailed when Senate GOP leaders refused to assign it to a committee. This time around, the bill has been given to the Senate Judiciary, Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice Committee.

In the letter, Solis urged lawmakers to take “prompt action” to pass SB86, dismissing some critics’ assertions that it could dull religious freedom.",1

"WATSONVILLE, CA — The family of an elderly man who went missing from Clovis and turned up in Watsonville last month recently sent a sweet and symbolic thank you package to the police department. Gerry Haney, 87, drove about 145 miles away from home before he was discovered behind Martinellis in Watsonville on Valentines Day. The day before, the Clovis Police Department issued a Silver Alert for Haney, who was believed to be headed for Los Angeles or San Bernardino. Police said Haney was disoriented, hungry and tired. They brought him back to the police department, where he was fed and kept safe until his family arrived to take him home. To show their gratitude, Haneys wife and daughters sent police a thank-you package containing items symbolizing something about his rescue: a bottle of Martinellis cider; a deck of cards for other missing persons to use as a way to pass the time; greeting cards; a heart-shaped photo; and Valentines Day decorations and balloons.

"A rash in home break-ins has come to a halt now that one of the prime suspects is hospitalized with a medical condition. Ten houses were broken into over a three-week period in late August and early September, Chief Daniel Grant said Tuesday. All of the houses were located in the area of 18th and Fort streets, between Eureka and Ford. Screens were cut on windows left open at night. The thief or thieves would sometimes just reach in and grab valuables, or other times, would climb through the window to steal things from inside, Grant said. A laptop computer was reported stolen, along with items from several purses. Basically, just anything that was laying around and easily in reach, Grant said. While no arrests have been made, Grant said, detectives believe they know who theyre after. We have had contact with a couple people who are likely suspects, he said. One of them had a medical issue and might not be out of the hospital yet. And since such time, theyve kind of died down. There hasnt been another break-in over the last 10 to 14 days, Grant said. Were keeping an eye on the area, he said. I know our officers on night shift have been doing a great job getting out, checking the alleys or anybody thats out late at night.",0

Thaddaeus Dankert, 20, appeared before Cook County Judge Michael Kane on felony charges of a hate crime and two counts of aggravated battery. Dankert is also charged with a misdemeanor for unlawful consumption of alcohol by a minor.

"LARKSPUR, CA – A student was arrested Friday morning on suspicion of making a bomb threat to Redwood High School in Larkspur last week, authorities said. A message was left on the schools confidential tip line Sept. 19 stating that there would be a bomb at the campus at 395 Doherty Drive that day, according to the Central Marin Police Authority.

"WASHINGTON - In the first six months of 2018, 100 hate crimes have allegedly been committed against people from marginalized groups, said Amnesty International India today, as it released data recorded on its interactive website, ‘Halt the Hate’.

The term ‘hate crime’ is applied to criminal acts against people based on their real or perceived membership of a particular group, such as caste, religion or ethnicity.

“The first step to ensuring justice and ending impunity for hate crimes is to highlight their occurrence. Our website seeks to draw attention to these alleged hate crimes by tracking and recording them. Many of these incidents are deeply disturbing. Dalits have been attacked for merely riding horses, Muslims lynched on rumors of cattle-slaughter and Dalit women raped and burnt to death”, said Aakar Patel, Executive Director, Amnesty International India.

“Hate crimes are different from other crimes because there is an underlying discriminatory motive behind these crimes. However, the law – with some exceptions – does not recognize hate crimes as separate offences. This means that even today, the extent of hate crimes in India is unknown. Police need to unmask any potentially discriminatory motives during investigation and duly record them.”

‘Halt the Hate’ website documents hate crimes allegedly committed against Dalits, Adivasis, members of racial or religious minority groups, transgender people, and other marginalized people, reported in mainstream English and Hindi media. In just the first six months of 2018, 67 incidents of alleged hate crimes against Dalits and 22 against Muslims were recorded. 42 incidents involved killings and 10 involved sexual violence against women from marginalized groups.

The website documents these crimes from September 2015, when Mohammad Akhlaq was killed in Dadri, Uttar Pradesh, for allegedly killing a cow. Since that day, a disturbing 603 incidents have been recorded on the website. Cow-related violence and so-called ‘honour’ killings were among the most common instances of alleged hate crimes. Previously, in 2016 and 2017, Uttar Pradesh recorded the highest number of alleged hate crimes. This time too, the highest number was from Uttar Pradesh. Gujarat, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Bihar also recorded a high number of incidents.

“The data on our website is just a snapshot of alleged hate crimes in India. Many incidents are not reported in the media. While criminal investigations have been initiated in some cases, too many have gone unpunished. Authorities need to do much more to ensure justice for victims and their families”, said Aakar Patel, Executive Director, Amnesty International India.

“Victims and their families should be provided with the necessary legal, medical and psychological support. They must be adequately compensated and rehabilitated, and protected against threats, harassment, intimidation and attacks.”

The ‘Halt the Hate’ website was designed by the Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology, Bengaluru.

"COLLEGE PARK, Md. — The FBI is investigating whether the stabbing of a visiting black student by a white student at the University of Maryland was a hate crime, officials said Sunday.

Sean Christopher Urbanski has been charged with first- and second-degree murder as well as first-degree assault in the early Saturday attack that killed Richard Collins III, police said.

University of Maryland Police Chief David Mitchell said he asked the FBI to assist in the investigation after learning that Urbanski, 22, belonged to a Facebook group called “Alt-Reich: Nation,” where members post disparaging material about African-Americans and others.

“We are here to evaluate that as an ongoing concern with respect to whether or not this was a hate crime,” Gordon Johnson, special agent in charge of the FBI field office in Baltimore, told reporters at a news conference.

No attorney was listed for Urbanski in online court records and a message left at a number listed for his home in Severna Park was not immediately returned Sunday.

Collins, 23, who was set to graduate from Bowie State on Tuesday, was visiting friends at the College Park campus when he was stabbed. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the US Army days earlier, Mitchell said.

Officials say Collins was with two friends near a bus stop on campus around 3 a.m. when they heard Urbanski screaming and watched him approach them.

Urbanski said, “Step left, step left if you know what’s best for you,” according to the charging documents. Collins said “no” before Urbanski stabbed him once in the chest, the documents say.

Mitchell, the police chief, said the attack has spread fear across the university.

“If I’m a person of color, I would certainly look at this as something that could happen to me. In fact, I know on Facebook our students are saying that,” Mitchell said.

Dr. Artie Lee Travis, vice president for student affairs at Bowie State, said the school hopes the investigation moves forward as quickly as possible.

“Hate has no place in America,” Travis said. “Hate has no place on a college campus, where young minds are coming together to try to change the world.”

Brian Douglas, who recently became close to Collins when they took a class together, said the man was looking forward to graduation.

“He was just nice, just a good, young man all around. You can’t find those too often in today’s society,” Douglas said.

Ciera Sorrell, who also took a class with Collins, said his killing shocked the Bowie State community.

“Everyone is in disbelief,” she said. “He seemed so excited to get to live his life and he doesn’t have that chance anymore.”

The attack came as the University of Maryland hosted visitors for graduation festivities.

During Sunday’s graduation ceremony, School President Wallace Loh led students and their families in a moment of silence for the slain Bowie State student. Loh called it a “senseless and unprovoked assault,” the Baltimore Sun reported.

“We are still in shock that a young man, so full of promise, should have his life cut short, so suddenly,” Loh said. “Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends, and with the entire Bowie State University community.”",1
"EDITORIAL: Timothy Trybus, hate crimes and why decent people are sick and tired

Screen image of Timothy G. Trybus yelling at a woman in the Forest Preserve for wearing a Puerto Rican T-Shirt.

Timothy Trybus got what he deserves.



The middle-aged loudmouth starring in a viral video for all the wrong reasons — a bigoted, threatening rant berating a young woman for wearing a Puerto Rican flag shirt — has been charged with a hate crime.

We can only hope this might, in some small way, discourage other bullies eager to spew their ignorance.

EDITORIAL

Because if there’s any group “infesting” America right now, it’s loudmouths and bigots, not immigrants and refugees, whatever our president might claim.

Decent people are tired of the meanness.



But, hey, the bullies are just following the president’s lead.



We can’t know for certain, of course, whether an affinity for Trump’s vitriolic worldview factored into Trybus’ tirade. But you can line up the argument.

The president did call Puerto Ricans lazy. Remember that? And he did suggest it was just too darn expensive for the federal government to help the island recover after Hurricane Maria. And we’ll never forget how he whined that Puerto Ricans, standing hip deep in flood water, “want everything to be done for them.”



Gotta wonder if Trybus heard that, too.

And when Trump called Mexican immigrants “criminals and rapists?” You have to wonder if those words flashed through the mind of a California woman who recently was charged with attacking a 92-year-old man — we repeat, 92 — with a brick while yelling “Go back to Mexico!”

Hate crimes are a very real and documented problem, and it has only grown worse in the Era of Trump.

But it’s not just the hate crimes. It’s the daily acts of bias and intolerance. It’s all making our American culture so much more toxic.

We’re thinking about the woman in Ohio who thought it was OK to call the cops on a 12-year-old black kid who was mowing grass in the neighborhood.

We’re thinking about the man in a California coffee shop who harassed a Muslim woman in a hijab, telling her he didn’t like her religion because “it says to kill me.”

And we’re thinking about the Palos Township trustee who frets on Facebook about “all” the local schools “filling” with Muslim immigrants from the Middle East who keep “their activities hidden.”

Nothing but dog whistles there.

None of these folks are criminals. Their offenses certainly don’t rise to the level of hate crimes.

But they’re all swimming in Trump’s dirty water.

"(Newser) – I got stabbed in the neck on my way to work, randomly, by a stranger I dont know, for trying to just be a nice person, says Micah Fletcher. I dont know what to do after that. In one of his first interviews since suffering a serious wound to his neck during a stabbing attack on a MAX train in Portland, Ore., the 21-year-old student says hes physically and mentally injured and focused on healing as much as I can, in whatever way I can, per KGW. Fletcher, who is out of the hospital, adds hes nobody special and that standing up to alleged attacker Jeremy Christian was simply the right thing to do, per KPTV. According to KGW, Fletcher pushed Christian after he made comments about decapitating heads to two teenage girls.

Police say Christian then stabbed Fletcher and two others who stood up to him. Rick Best, 53, and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, 23, did not survive. Charged with aggravated murder in their deaths, Christian appeared to defend his actions in court on Tuesday as Fletcher looked on. You call it terrorism, I call it patriotism. You hear me? Die, he said, per CNN. Death to the enemies of America. Leave this country if you hate our freedom, he added. According to court documents, Christian confessed to the attack inside a patrol car. A video camera allegedly recorded him saying, I just stabbed a bunch of [expletive] in their neck ... I can die in prison a happy man. He allegedly added, I hope they all die, per the Oregonian. He is due back in court on June 7.

"Many have applauded the heroism of Micah David-Cole Fletcher, who was stabbed while attempting to protect two teen girls from a hate crime recently in Portland, Ore. Two other men died fighting off the violent white supremacist attacker, who now faces murder charges.

But Fletcher has a message for all those reaching out to him with financial support: No donations, please.

In a six-minute video posted to Facebook, Fletcher explained that the focus needs to be on the teenagers targeted in the hate crime.

Fletcher wants to shift public focus to 16-year-old Destinee Magnum and her 17-year-old friend who was wearing a hijab, as the black girls were the actual targets of the attack. Prosecutors say the attacker yelled at the girls to go home and mentioned Saudi Arabia in a profanity laced tirade before anyone stepped in.

Fletcher started the video by quickly thanking viewers before stressing how a stabbing would harm a young person’s mind. The little girl who had the misfortune that day to experience what happened on that night, her life is never going to be the same,” he said.

“We need to remember that this is about them,” he continued. “Yes, two men died. Yes, I was injured...We need to remember that this is about those little girls.”

The video also noted that the mentality of supporting someone like him in this situation propels the notion of the white savior.

“We in Portland have this weird tendency to continue patterns that we’ve done forever, and one of them is this same old, just to put it bluntly, white savior complex,” Fletcher said. “I have no interest in being dishonest... I think it’s immensely, immensely morally wrong and irresponsible how much money we have gotten as opposed to how much support, money, love, kindness, that has been given to that little girl.”

The idea of the white savior—of a privileged, typically white person stepping in to help a person of color—hinges on the notion that the person doing the saving gets more attention than the victim.

As writer Teju Cole noted for “The Atlantic” in response to the popular Kony 2012 movement, the white savior complex is a “valve for releasing the unbearable pressures that build in a system built on pillage.” Efforts to help via the savior do not go beyond the surface to reach those who are marginalized, Cole says.

Fletcher highlighted that you can support the young women by donating to them directly.

Along with the hashtag #ChangeHerDestinee, Fletcher reminded those hoping to help that “they are the real victims here.”

The effort to raise money for the two young women has raised over $90,000 and will go to support their families basic needs along with help for their mental and emotional health.

Magnum’s mother, Dyjuana Hudson, added that some of the funds would go toward procuring a vehicle since she can no longer trust public transportation after the incident.

Magnum and Hudson are very thankful for the help and attention raised by people like Fletcher—but they need space to heal.

“We’re very appreciative of what is being done for us,” Hudson said in a video posted to Facebook. “Even though there were guys that gave their lives for my girls, we still just want to say we really appreciate what’s being done.”

Both Magnum and Hudson expressed deep thanks in tandem with a need for space to process. “When the time comes, we will come forth and be willing to give any information that is needed or wanted,” Hudson said. “For right now, it’s all too much to keep re-hashing it over and over again.”

"Marq Vincent Perez, 25, currently is only charged with possession of a destructive, incendiary device stemming from a separate incident where he is accused of attempting to set a car on fire. The affidavit of probable cause, used to arrest Perez, is sealed from public inspection.

But at a detention hearing Thursday in Corpus Christi, Texas, a federal investigator told a judge that Perez is believed responsible for Jan. 28 fire at the Victoria Islamic Center, 125 miles southwest of Houston.

A confidential informant admitted burglarizing the mosque on Jan. 22 and again on Jan. 28 with Perez, and identified Perez as the arsonist, special agent Rick Miller of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives testified, the Victoria Advocate reported in today’s editions.

Items taken during those burglaries, along with firearms, explosive devices and a bullet-proof vest, were recovered when federal agents searched the suspect’s home earlier this month, the ATF agent testified.

U.S. Magistrate Judge B. Janice Ellington said evidence of his Perez’ suspected involvement in a “hate crime” led her to order the suspect held without bond as a danger to the community and flight risk.

“The evidence against the defendant is substantial, and the testimony of ATF Agent Miller was unrefuted [and] credible,” the federal judge said.

Defense attorney Mark Di Carlo, who represents Perez, told media outlets that his client is not charged with the mosque arson at this point, even though that allegation was raised in court. Perez currently is only charged federally with having “five large firecrackers that were taped together on to one fuse,” Di Carlo said.

As such investigations go forward, investigators take evidence and witnesses before a closed-door, secret federal grand jury panel where prosecutors outline alleged criminal activity and ask for charges in a federal indictment.

It took investigators almost two weeks before they declared the Victoria mosque fire an act of arson. The investigation is on-going.

Stephen Ruiz told the Victoria newspaper he has been a friend of the suspect since the two attended the city’s Memorial High School together. Ruiz “described Perez as a ‘right-wing extremist’ who made racist comments about the mosque close to the time of the fire,” the newspaper reported.

“Hes never liked anyone foreign,” Ruiz said of his friend Perez.

Meanwhile, the Texas office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) today issued a statement saying it “welcomed an arrest of a man suspected of setting fire to the Islamic Center of Victoria.”

“We welcome this arrest and thank investigators for their swift and professional actions in apprehending the alleged arsonist,” said Mustafaa Carroll, the executive director of CAIR’s office in Houston.

“The actions of law enforcement authorities send a strong message of deterrence to others who may consider turning their bigoted views into violent actions,” Carroll said.

The CAIR statement said the arson suspect appears to be a “right-wing extremist” with “an apparent hatred of Muslims” who mistakenly believes they are terrorists. The suspect may have targeted multiple mosques based on his social media comments, the statement said.

CAIR also is monitoring the investigation of a fire that occurred at a mosque under construction in Travis County, Texas. Investigators, who haven’t ruled out arson, now say they may never know the exact source of that fire.",1
"Watching the statue topple at the Vietnamese Buddhist Meditation Center in Tacoma, David Wright felt like a part of him shattered as well.

“It grabbed me deep in the gut,” he said.

The incident was captured on video. Jereme Clarke is facing a charge of second-degree malicious mischief. Police said he broke a religious statue at the temple, tried to pull down a pillar with his car, and called the members devil worshippers.

According to court documents, he told investigators he was ‘doing [God’s] work.’

“A great range of folks really want to express our care to the Vietnamese Buddhist community,” said Wright.

Wright is a pastor, and the chaplain at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma.

“When hate came to Tacoma in this way, we felt the need to do something specific about this,” he said.

Members of the temple previously expressed a desire that Clarke be charged with a hate crime. Wright said he believes that’s important.

“Based on what appears to be an act against someone’s identity, their religious and cultural identities, to cause harm … I believe that would rise to the standard,” he said.

The Federal Bureau of Investigations defines a hate crime as a “criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity.”

The Bureau’s website also notes: “Hate itself is not a crime—and the FBI is mindful of protecting freedom of speech and other civil liberties.”

A spokesperson for the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department deferred a request to the the county prosecutor. A spokesperson for the prosecutor’s office was not able to provide a response by Tuesday night if they plan to pursue hate crime charges.

Still – Wright said he believes a sacred space was violated, and wants to see the case treated that way.

“That’s something that is not just vandalism,” he said. “That is an act of hate, an expression of hate. And I’m less interested in the punishment of that than in saying, this is what this is, and how do we help people realize the harm that causes.”

"It’s what the police and prosecutors say happened. And they put someone in jail for it. But the police and prosecutors don’t want any pictures of the alleged graffiti getting out there. Neither does the mayor, for that matter.

A prosecutor from the state’s attorney’s office believes that showing pictures of Claar’s defaced property will make it harder to convict the alleged vandal, a Bolingbrook official said, and also “would jeopardize the accused’s right to a fair trial.”

It’s reassuring that the prosecutor is concerned about the rights of the accused who, incidentally, has been locked up in the Will County jail for more than a month now.

Getting out can’t be that easy for her, since the same state’s attorney’s office that’s so concerned about her rights hit her with a draconian bond of $150,000.",1

"BELLEVUE, WA - A video of Bellevue police Tasing and arresting a black teen has been viewed over 4 million times online, and a leader of the local NAACP chapter told KING 5 that the use of force depicted in the video was excessive. Bellevue police Chief Steve Mylett is pledging to investigate the incident, however. The video was shared on Facebook by the gossip website Media Takeout. The video shows a group of officers informing the teen that he is going to get arrested. After a short back-and-forth with the teen, several officers move in to make an arrest, and appear to use a Taser as they place him in handcuffs. Mylett told KING 5 that the incident took place on Saturday at the Bellevue Square Mall. The teen had been banned from the mall, and officers were attempting to remove him for trespassing. Mylett also said the teen was a suspect in a car theft. In the moments before the video was taken, Mylett told KING 5, the teen had fled from police on foot. Comments on the video on Facebook criticize the officers response, in particular that it took so many police officers to subdue one person.

LOS ANGELES- LAPD is investigating after a home owned by LeBron James was targeted in a possible hate crime.

According to a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Department, someone spray painted the n-word on the front gate of the home.

A neighbor notified LAPD shortly before 7 a.m. Wednesday about the incident. By the time officers arrived, the graffiti had been covered up. Detectives are canvassing the area looking for security footage that would possibly show the suspect.

So far, the suspect has not been identified.

Property records show James purchased the 9,400 square foot home in the Brentwood neighborhood for $21 million in 2015.

LeBron was not at the home at the time of the incident, as he is gearing up for Game 1 of the NBA Finals against the Warriors.",1
"A popular butcher at a West Village meat market has been arrested on a hate crime charge after he allegedly gave a black deliveryman a noose last month, police say.

Joe Ottomanelli of Ottomanelli & Sons Meat Market on Bleecker Street, allegedly gave the deliveryman a yellow-roped noose with a disturbing message on April 4, authorities said.

If you ever have any stress, just put it around your neck and pull it. I could even help you with it, Ottomanelli allegedly told the 36-year-old deliveryman as he laughed, the Daily News reported.

The deliveryman, whos delivered meat to the butcher for the past eight months, brought the noose to the Sixth Precinct stationhouse in Greenwich Village and filed a report, police said. He alleges that the butcher has made racially insensitive comments before, but the deliveryman brushed them off.

The NYPDs Hate Crime Task Force investigated, and Ottomanelli was arrested Wedneday.

The longtime butcher told The Daily News last month that the two were just fooling around and never thought his joke would be taken as a racial attack because the meat market works with other black drivers.

This is an unfortunate circumstance that we are working to resolve immediately, Ottomanelli & Sons said in a statement to the newspaper Thursday. We are a family-owned business with over 50 years of service in the Village, and have the utmost respect for all of our employees and patrons.

The deliveryman said he doesnt plan to return to the decades-old shop again.",1
"NEWTOWN, CT — In a bizarre twist of events, the owner of the Rooster Wine and Liquor Store on South Main Street in Newtown was charged with staging an armed robbery and a fire at his own establishment, police said. Scott Young, 39, of Southington faces multiple charges including arson, insurance fraud and criminal mischief after he was arrested on an outstanding warrant following a lengthy investigation. At the time of the incident on Jan. 21, Young told police that two suspects had robbed the store, set it on fire and painted swastikas on the rear door of the building. Lt. Aaron Bahamonde told Patch that numerous pieces of evidence including the spray painting led officers to believe the incident was staged. Certain evidence with the spray painting indicated that this might be a staged scene, said Bahamonde. Much more evidence forensic and physical evidence led us to believe he was the perpetrator in this crime. Youngs motives for the incident are still under investigation by police. The fact that Mr. Young used racial epithets and symbolism to cover up a crime was extremely disturbing to not only the community, but all the agencies involved, said Police Chief James Viadero in a statement.Such an incident unnerves the community and we are thankful we could bring the incident to a successful resolution and put everyones concern at ease. Young told police that two suspects had entered the store, one of whom brandished a handgun. He told police that the suspects later started a fire in the rear of the building and sprayed two swastikas and a racial slur on the back door of the building. Police said that investigators had been working endlessly to prepare an arrest warrant for Young. He was charged with arson in the first degree, insurance fraud, criminal mischief in the first degree, three counts of reckless endangerment in the first degree, providing a false statement in the second degree and interfering with an officer. Young was held on a court-set bond of $100,000. Editors Note: This story was posted earlier this week. Here it is again in case you missed it. Image via Google Earth Screenshot",0
"It is now a week after the horrific events in Charlottesville. It has been a week full of news breaking faster than we can keep up with it and a rising tide of voices raised in opposition to the display of white supremacist violence and vitriol ... and to the stunning lack of moral leadership from a President either incapable or unwilling to condemn it.

From the Joint Chiefs of Staff issuing their own definitive anti-racism statement to CEOs fleeing his council of advice to the truly awesome letter of resignation from members of the Presidents Council on the Arts and the Humanities -- and even from some GOP leaders on Capitol Hill -- the message has been loud, clear and consistent: there are no two sides when one of the sides is torch bearing Nazis.

And yet what we hear from the Presidents Faith Advisory Council is ... crickets.

Now, let me be clear. An advisory council that includes Jerry Falwell, James Dobson and Michelle Bachmann is not a group of folks I expect to agree with. Almost ever. About almost anything. But even given that reality, when were talking about torch bearing white supremacist thugs carrying Nazi flags and terrorizing a prayer meeting one night and then inciting violence that killed one and injured 19 the next day you would think this at least would be an exception. This at least would be a place — in spite of our differences — we could find common moral ground.

If ever a moment called out for united, moral leadership it is this one ... and yet the faith voices advising the President speak volumes with their silence. No wonder Jesus wept.

And yet, it is also a teachable moment: a moment my friend and mentor the Reverend Dr. Susan Thistlethwaite has taught us to recognize as a public theology moment.

Exhibit A: My twitter response this morning to Faith Advisory Council member Pastor Mark Burns:

Exhibit B: Response from a twitter follower.

Now ... will one person finding out the story of Dietrich Bonhoeffer fix racism in our nation or eradicate the toxin of white supremacy? Of course not. But its a teeny, tiny example of what we can do to act as agents of change as we resist the tide of ignorance, the flood of fake news and the rise of revisionist history plaguing our country.

Jesus told us the truth will set you free (John 8:32) and the truth is knowing our history and sharing our history is one way of believing the future into being.

Minnesota Mosque Bombing

After what Gov. Mark Dayton called an act of terror, the FBI is searching for suspects in the bombing of a mosque in Bloomington, Minnesota. No one was injured in the blast Saturday morning, though morning attendees were praying nearby when the improvised explosive device ignited in the imams office, according to the bureau. Both the Muslim American Society and the Council on American-Islamic Relations have offered $10,000 rewards for information related to the attack that leads to an arrest. (New York Magazine)

A Search For Missing Marines Ends

Officials are no longer searching for three members of the United States Marine Corps who were involved in what the military described as a mishap off the coast of Australia on Saturday. The missing Marines were part of a 26-person crew aboard the MV-22 Osprey in question; the 23 other crew members were rescued. The aircraft was conducting regularly scheduled operations at the time of the incident. (Patch)

Concealed Carry Laws And Crime

Allowing people to carry concealed firearms, under what are known as concealed carry or right to carry laws, led to a significant increase in violent crime, according to a recent research paper presented by the National Bureau of Economic Research. The authors used various models to compare states that changed their gun laws with more than 14 years of data. Ten years after enacting this type of law, the authors found, the violent crime rate was 13 to 15 percent higher than it would have been otherwise. (NBER)

Hate crimes, most notably attacks against Jews and Muslims, have risen sharply in several Major American cities in 2016, starting with the presidential campaign and continuing since, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. Previously unpublished data by the university’s Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism show double-digit increases in hate crimes in New York City, Cincinnati, Chicago, and Columbus, Ohio last year.

There were 1,037 incidents, a 23.3% increase from 2015, in the nine areas the report examined: New York; Washington; Chicago; Philadelphia; Montgomery County, Maryland; Columbus, Ohio; Seattle; Long Beach, California; and Cincinnati. Here are a few striking notes:

Advertisement

New York City saw a rise of 24% in hate crimes, the highest in more than a decade.

New York state had an increase of 20% in hate crimes.

Chicago had a rise of 24% in hate crimes, highest since 2010.

Cincinnati, Ohio, had a phenomenal jump in hate crimes by 38%.

Columbus, Ohio, saw an increase of close to 10%.

Montgomery County, Maryland, bordering Washington, DC, had a frightening increase of more than 42%.

Seattle, Washington, saw an increase of 6% in “malicious harassment.”

The FBI’s most recent hate crime report, issued November, 2016, showed an increase in hate crimes of “only” 7% in 2015, but included in this data is a jump of 67% in hate crimes against Muslims.

The new hate crime report was conducted under the supervision of Criminologist and attorney Brian Levin, who is a professor of criminal justice and Director of the nonpartisan Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino where he specializes in the analysis of hate crime, domestic and international terrorism and related legal issues.

Levin wrote in The Huffington Post in late February that “Jews remain the most targeted faith community, both numerically and proportionally, accounting for 11.4% of all hate crime and 53% of all religious hate crime.”

Levin pointed out, however, that “in 2009, by contrast, Jews fared worse, constituting 14.1% of all hate crime incidents and 71.45% of religious hate crimes. Even with the declines of preceding years, Jews in 2015 were represented almost six times as much as a percentage of hate crime targets as they were as a percentage of the American population.”

The Southern Poverty Law Center reported last month that the number of hate groups in the US rose from 892 in 2015 to 917 in 2016. The number of anti-Muslim hate groups soared from 34 in 2015 to 101 in 2016.",1
"The Moab City Council is taking a stand in support of state legislation that would strengthen the penalties against criminals who intentionally target their victims based on a person’s identity or background.

Council members unanimously approved a resolution this month that calls on the Utah Legislature to give law enforcement officials stronger tools to crack down on victim-targeted crimes. In particular, the resolution hones in on offenders who target their victims on the basis of ancestry, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, nationality, race, religion and sexual orientation.

Moab City Council member Rani Derasary brought the resolution to the council for its consideration after reading about related trends in Utah.

“We, as a state, have hate-crime legislation on the books, but for years, we’ve been hearing that it’s literally unenforceable,” Derasary said during the council’s meeting on Tuesday, Oct. 10.

State lawmakers adopted Utah’s first hate-crime law in 1992, but in the quarter-century since that time, not one person has ever been convicted of a hate crime, according to the nonprofit group Equality Utah.

State Sen. Daniel Thatcher, R-West Valley City, thinks the time has come to change that law – and in order for his proposed amendments to succeed, he wishes that advocates and journalists would stop using the term “hate-crime law” altogether.

“If I could get people to stop calling it a ‘hate crime,’ I’d be halfway to getting this passed,” Thatcher told the Moab Sun News.

You can’t prove hate in a court of law, he said. But Utah lawmakers can follow the lead of their counterparts in Wisconsin, he said: In 1992, that state crafted a law that allowed authorities to consider whether a crime was committed or initially considered due to an intended victim’s status in a protected class. The U.S Supreme Court later upheld that law, ruling that enhanced penalties for racially motivated crimes do not violate a criminal defendant’s First Amendment rights.

To be clear, Thatcher said he is not proposing to create a new classification of crime.

“What we are proposing is an enhanced penalty – an enhanced sentence,” he said. “We enhance penalties for all manners of things, so doesnt it make sense that we enhance penalties for targeting an entire community?”

As it is, the law that’s on the books excludes criteria that would lead to the prosecution of crimes committed against someone due to that person’s race, sexual orientation and gender identity, among other factors.

For example, Thatcher said, it does not differentiate between a person who spray-paints threatening anti-Muslim screeds on private property, and someone else who spray-paints “have a nice day.”

“Under current Utah law, those are the exact same crime, and I find that unacceptable,” Thatcher said.

The undercurrent of the state’s existing law, he said, is that a judge cannot consider whether an act was committed to intimidate a victim.

“I think thats a failure on our part,” he said. “We have an obligation to fix it.”

“All I’m asking is that a judge be allowed to consider whether an offender intentionally or deliberately targeted the victim based on the color of their skin (for example),” he said. “I think thats pretty straightforward.”

Derasary noted that former State Sen. Steve Urquhart, R-St. George, first tried to expand Utah’s hate-crime legislation so that it wouldn’t be what numerous prosecutors have called “gutless,” she said.

When Urquhart left the Utah Legislature, Thatcher took on the issue of victim targeting. But during the last legislative session, Derasary said, he was unable to even get a hearing for his legislation, Senate Bill 72.

“He was told that there just wasn’t an interest in the state to support it,” Derasary said.

As the 2018 legislative session approaches, Thatcher is once again pushing ahead with another version of the bill, and he’s relying on municipalities around Utah to help him make his case to his fellow lawmakers.

“He thinks that cities can help settle that argument,” Derasary said.

So far, a number of communities across the state have passed similar resolutions, starting with West Jordan, and continuing with South Salt Lake City and Beaver County.

‘I’m very encouraged,” Thatcher told the Moab Sun News.

Thatcher said that legislators focus on particular issues – his own area of expertise is criminal justice – yet he said that many of them don’t necessarily think about the issue of victim targeting. But he’s hopeful that they’ll pay attention as momentum builds for similar resolutions of support.

“When they start hearing from their city councils, their county commissions and their constituents, then they have to care,” he said.

For now, however, Thatcher said that he and other advocates of tougher revisions to the existing law are facing pushback from many people who think the proposal would be used to affect people’s free speech rights.

“Until we can address those concerns, we’re going to have a hard time getting this through,” he said.

That pushback arose during the 2017 legislative session in spite of the fact that the Utah Statewide Association of Prosecutors, the Utah Chiefs of Police Association and the Utah Sheriffs Association rallied behind SB 72.

“This bill, because of the stigma that is attached to hate crimes, is the only time weve had law enforcement unified around an issue and had the state legislature reject it,” Thatcher said. “Its the only time Ive seen politics win out on a criminal justice issue involving policy.”

According to Equality Utah, law enforcement agencies in the state reported 1,279 hate crimes in the past two decades. Almost half of those reported incidents were committed against a person because of his or her race. Another 20 percent were committed against someone because of their religion, while 17 percent of these crimes were tied to a person’s ethnicity, and 15 percent were tied to a victim’s sexual orientation.

For Derasary, the issue of victim targeting is timely and important, given recent reports of bullying at local schools.

“I personally feel very strongly about this, especially because of some of the issues our youth are dealing with,” Derasary said “… I think it’s important for us as leaders to stand up and say, ‘We see and appreciate everyone in the community; we’re trying to listen to you; we can’t always do everything perfectly, but we value you, and you guys are the ones that make living here so great.’”

Grand County Council vice chair Mary McGann told the Moab Sun News that she would like to follow the city’s lead by bringing the resolution to the county board – perhaps as early as next month.

McGann said she is motivated largely by the January 2017 death of Grand County Middle School student Lily McClish, who died by suicide after some of her peers reportedly bullied her.

“I would be happy to champion it, because what I saw through what happened to a young girl at our middle school this year was horrendous,” she said.

Grand County Council chair Jaylyn Hawks said she isn’t familiar with Thatcher’s efforts, but if the resolution comes before the council, she would likely join McGann in backing the proposal.

“On the surface, it sounds like a good idea,” Hawks said. “Without having looked at it closely, I would say that I could support it.”",1
"PASADENA, CA — A TV news-generated anonymous tip has led to the arrest of a 51-year-old parolee dubbed the Office Creeper, who was wanted for a string of wallet and credit card thefts throughout the San Gabriel Valley and Burbank, police said Friday. Pasadena police detectives, a detective from the Glendale Police Department and state parole agents arrested Anthony Fierro of Huntington Park on Wednesday. A career criminal with nine prior violent felony convictions, Fierro had been called the Office Creeper because of the stealthy manner in which he crept through office hallways, stole wallets from womens purses and later fraudulently used their credit cards, costing victims and retailers thousands of dollars in losses, Pasadena police Lt. John Luna said. A break in the case came when Glendale Police Department Detective Kelly Kramer received an anonymous tip identifying Fierro, after the tipster saw Glendales wanted suspect information on the TV news. After Fierro was identified as a parolee, Pasadena Detective Victor Cass took the lead in organizing the multi-agency arrest and search teams, according to Luna, who said Fierro was taken into custody at a parole office in El Monte. Investigators then searched Fierros home, where crucial evidence was found, Luna said. Fierro was being held without bail and was due to be arraigned Friday on 14 felony counts, police said.

"(Reuters) - A 21-year-old Ohio man accused of killing a woman after plowing his car into a group protesting a white nationalist rally in Virginia last year pleaded not guilty to federal hate crime charges on Thursday, prosecutors said.

The hearing in Charlottesville, Virginia was the first time James Alex Fields Jr. appeared in court to face the charges, for which he could face the death penalty if convicted. Fields also faces separate state murder charges in Virginia.

Fields’ lawyer Fred Heblich declined to comment on the hearing before Judge Joel Hoppe in the federal courthouse in Charlottesville. Brian McGinn, spokesman for the United States Attorney’s Office in the Western District of Virginia, said Fields pleaded not guilty to all 30 charges and gave no further statements about the plea.

Hundreds of people descended on the college town of Charlottesville in August 2017 to protest the removal of a statue honoring a commander of the Confederate Army, the losing side of the U.S. Civil War, in what was billed as a Unite the Right rally.

Counter-protesters turned out to demonstrate against the rally and there were clashes between both sides. Fields is charged with driving his car into a group of counter-protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring dozens of people.

U.S. President Donald Trump was criticized across the political spectrum when he said afterward that both sides were to blame for the violence.

Fields regularly touted racist ideologies on his social media accounts, including expressing support for Adolf Hitler and the Holocaust, according to the indictment.

Authorities have charged Fields with one count of a hate crime act resulting in death, 28 counts of hate crime acts causing bodily injury and involving an attempt to kill, and one count of racially motivated violent interference with a federally protected activity. If convicted of a hate crime act resulting in death, Fields may face the death penalty, although it is not clear whether prosecutors plan to seek capital punishment.

"(MIAMI, FL, 3/28/2018) The Florida Chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-Florida), the States largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, t oday expressed concern that a recent cross-burning in front of a home in Harbor Point, Fla., is not being investigated as a hate crime.

The Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office is investigating the incident in which a wooden cross was set on fire in front of the residence of Dr. Mohamed Omar Saleh, a local psychiatrist. The Florida Times-Union reported that, “Officer Melissa Bujeda, a Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman, confirmed a cross was burned at the scene and said an intelligence unit and evidence technician were assigned to the case. But it cannot be classified as a hate crime yet.”

Traditionally, cross-burnings have been directly associated with xenophobic and racist sentiments.

CAIR-Florida is assigning resources to ensure that hate crimes against the community are investigated and indicted as such.

“CAIR-Florida’s Civil Rights Department and our regional coordinators are actively contacting the parties affected and urging the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office to treat and investigate this incident as a possible hate crime,” said CAIR-FL Communications Director Wilfredo Amr Ruiz.

WEST HARTFORD – A University of Hartford student said she was the victim of disturbing harassment by her roommate. That roommate was charged with criminal mischief and breach of peace, but the CT NAACP said that is not going far enough.

Members with the NAACP along with city officials gathered outside of the West Hartford Police Department Wednesday night for a rally and a press conference. They demanded Brianna Brochu be charged with a hate crime.

“It’s probably one of the most disgusting and nastiest things I’ve ever heard in my adult life,” said CT NAACP President Scot Esdaile.

It just was one week ago when FOX61 learned Brochu was charged following accusations that she tampered with roommate Chennel Rowe’s belongings.

“Rubbing bloody tampons on my things, so like she posted pictures of my Steve Madden bag that I had been sleeping next to the whole time on my bed with blood stains on it,” said Rowe.

The day after FOX61’s first story aired, police sent out an update and said they would request the court to add the charge of intimidation based on bigotry or bias, a hate crime charge. However, one week later and that charge still has not happened.

“We had conversations with the District Attorney and we had conversations with the West Hartford Police Department asking why this is not done and they were kind of like passing the buck,” added Esdaile.

The NAACP said the District Attorney’s office never received a written request or any documents from the West Hartford Police Department on hate crime charges.

“For the authorities not to take care of this, I mean, everyone’s dragging their feet on it, it’s totally unacceptable. Totally unacceptable,” added Esdaile.

Jean McDermott were one of the people who attended the rally and said she joined because she felt a personal connection to Rowe.

“It struck very close to home for me. I have a Jamaican daughter-in-law who’s very petite and dark-skinned just like Jasmine and so, I definitely think that she deserves a lot of support,” said McDermott.

The rally generated a large crowd and a University of Hartford shuttle even dropped off students who wanted to participate. The NAACP’s message Wednesday night was to see Brochu charged with a hate crime before her next court appearance.

“These are poisonous substances we’re talking about over a period of time to a complete innocent victim. It’s a hate crime,” added McDermott.

On Wednesday, UHarts President released an Immediate Plan for Action for their campus which revolves around issues of equity, inclusion, and diversity. President Greg Woodward said a number of suggestions for action have emerged following this incident.

What is clear to me is that each person and unit on campus has a part to play in moving forward, said Woodward.

Brochu’s next court appearance will be on Wednesday the 15th at 9 a.m. at Hartford Superior Court. The NAACP are urging people to rally outside of the courthouse that day for Brochu to be charged with a hate crime.",1

Jaimie Deblieck was attacked in the street of his hometown of Roeselare by an unknown assailant. He was pushed to the ground, stomped and kicked while the aggressor shouted “fucking homo.”

Deblieck ran and was taken to the hospital. He later reported the attack to police, who are investigating.

Deblieck posted about the attack on social media. “Attacking me from behind and stamping me is one thing,” he wrote on Facebook. “Calling me “fucking homo,” you’re gonna regret it. I’m not going to drop it, you coward.”

He also said that he did not suffer any permanent injuries and stressed the importance of reporting hate crimes.

“A lot of people like me in our country have had to deal with physical violence because of their sexual orientation and they do not yet dare to express themselves,” he wrote. “That’s why I decided to tell my story to the media. These incidents have to be reported.”

"Minneapolis Launches Controversial “Hate Crime” Hotline

“Hate crimes” can now be directly reported via telephone in Minneapolis. Using its pre-existing, taxpayer-funded 3-1-1 service, the city launched a hotline for residents to report “any crime against a person or property motivated by prejudice.”

Through its 311 service, the City of Minneapolis has opened a new hotline for reporting hate crimes, which are harassing behaviors motivated by prejudice. The hotline number is 311 for anyone calling from within the city or 612-673-3000 statewide. The 311 hotline will be answered 7 a.m.-7 p.m. weekdays and 8 a.m.-4:30 p.m. weekends.

A hate crime is any crime against a person or property motivated by prejudice against someone’s race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender or gender identity. This includes prejudice-motivated property damage (including graffiti), stalking and assault.

Harassing behaviors are usually unwanted or unwelcome, but that doesn’t mean a crime has been committed. And if a law is broken and a crime is committed, isn’t that why we have local police and a 911 service?

According to the Director of Minneapolis’ Department of Civil Rights—Velma Korbel—President Trump is the reason the hotline is needed.

Since the general election, many of us have experienced, witnessed firsthand or heard of actions of: racism, xenophobia, sexism and bigotry directed at people here and in cities across the United States. In no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated. Activities such as these are against the law. No one is above the law.

Well, actually, there’s no “hate speech” exception to the First Amendment. Even if the speech is offensive. There isn’t even a fixed legal definition for “hate speech” under U.S. law.

23-year-old Kelly Schneider pleaded guilty to a hate crime, and will serve 28 years in federal prison for violently beating Steven Nelson because of his sexual orientation. On Wednesday, the victims family was speaking out.

Cameras were not allowed inside the courtroom.

It was an emotional sentencing, with several of Nelsons family members reading victim impact statements with shaky voices and teary eyes.

The U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Idaho says Nelson was the target of a conspiracy ring and was attacked and later died because of who and how he loves.

On Wednesday, nearly a year after his death, his family is getting some justice and hopefully closing a painful chapter.

The criminal justice system is one aspect of getting past this, Nelsons brother, Eric Nelson, said.

Steven Nelson is missed every single day by everyone whose life he touched.

Steven reached out to people less fortunate than himself on an individual basis and tried to help them, Eric Nelson said.

To see the outpouring from his friends and people he helped on his Facebook page and at his memorial service was important to us, one of his other brothers, Dennis Nelson, added.

In federal court in Boise, Nelsons family shared their sorrow and anguish, as well as cherished memories of Steven. His death is societys loss, they said, because he was a huge advocate for educating people about the LGBTQ community, especially at the University of Idaho when he attended college there.

The world needs people like Steven who will make the arguments and stand up and say those things, his sister, Connie Nelson-Cleverley, said.

Steven Nelson

Chief U.S. District Court Judge B. Lynn Winmill sentenced Nelsons killer, Kelly Schneider, to 28 years (336 months) in federal prison for a hate crime charge of willful assault based on sexual orientation.

Its something I can live with, Eric said. In view of Schneiders acceptance of responsibility, we didnt have to go through yet another trial.

That sentence will run concurrent with a life sentence for first-degree murder; Schneider will spend at least 28 years behind bars before hes eligible for parole.

He has to serve in state court 28 years in prison before hes eligible for parole. Then he goes before the parole board, they determine whether to release him or not, Criminal Chief with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Idaho, Aaron Lucoff, told KTVB, In federal court, there is no parole, theres no parole board. Its just 28 years, you serve it. Theres a credit for good time served.

After serving time in federal prison, Schneider will serve five years of supervised release. He must also pay a $5,000 fine. His defense attorney asked that he serve his time in Victorville, Calif.

It was important for us to follow through on this charge with the hate crime because that, I think, captures what this was, Lucoff said.

Before the judge handed down the sentence, Schneider stood up, faced the Nelson family and apologized.

This is a tragedy all the way around and we cant bring Steven back. But we felt like it was a just resolution today. And he did plead guilty, accepted responsibility and it seemed like his apology to our family was heartfelt, Eric added.

Shockingly, Schneider told the judge he deserved an even longer sentence.

It doesnt always happen, Ill say that. I was surprised, Lucoff said. Rarely have I seen defendants stand up in court and ask for a longer sentence than what is recommended.

According to a plea deal reached with prosecutors, Schneider conspired with three other men to set Nelson up by posting a solicitation for sex on BackPage.com last April. After Nelson responded to the ad, he was attacked by Schneider and robbed by a group.

The U.S. Attorneys Office says Schneider kicked Nelson nearly 30 times with steel-toed boots, stripped him of his clothes and yelled homophobic slurs at him. Schneider and the other men took Nelsons clothes and money and left him for dead.

The question is: What does this case mean? Obviously, Steven Nelson is dead and theres nothing we can do about that. But hopefully this sentence sends a message that this community does not tolerate hate crimes, Lucoff added.

The familys message is this:

Turn away from hate. Turn toward love and it will pay dividends down the road.

In a public statement, the family expressed their appreciation to the Canyon County Sheriffs Office, Canyon County Prosecutors Office, the FBI, the U.S. Attorneys Office, and the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division for their hard work to date in bringing Kelly Schneider and Jayson Woods to justice for their roles in the tragic robbery and assault that resulted in Stevens death on April 29, 2016. We look forward to the just resolution against all four defendants that have been charged in the matter.

They go on to say, we hope that the era of misguided or hateful bigotry against sons, daughters, brothers and sisters due to sexual orientation will soon pass, so that they may live and love peacefully in the full light of day.

The U.S. Attorneys Office told us they dont plan on bringing hate crime charges against any of the other three defendants. One of the men, Jayson Woods, has already been found guilty of first-degree murder among other charges. The other two men charged, Kevin Tracy and Daniel Henkel, are set to appear in court on Monday, May 1.

There will be a Stand 4 Steven concert Thursday night to raise money for Boise State Universitys Steven Nelson Emergency Fund. This existing financial aid fund was renamed in Stevens honor - something the family says is therapeutic. The fund provides money for Boise State students experiencing financial hardship related to their sexual orientation.

It starts at 7 p.m. at the Knitting Factory in Downtown Boise. Tickets are $20.

"LISBON (Reuters) - All 18 officers at a Portuguese police station have been charged with torture, kidnapping, falsifying reports and other crimes allegedly motivated by racism following the 2015 arrest of six black youths, prosecutors said on Tuesday.

All the officers served with the Public Security Police patrolling force in Alfragide, a densely populated neighborhood which includes a slum called Cova da Moura, just a 15 minute drive from the center of Lisbon.

They were indicted for “torture and other cruel, degrading and inhuman treatment”, unlawful imprisonment, grave abuse of their powers and violation of their duties, the prosecutor’s office said in a statement on its website.

The charges were brought after a joint investigation by prosecutors and the Judicial Police that followed complaints by the families of the six youths, who were cleared of charges of resisting arrest and assault.

"The number of hate crimes increased 11.2 percent, from 837 in 2015 to 931 in 2016, according to a report Monday by Californias attorney general. However, that is down 34.7 percent since 2007.

Here are some details:

 56 percent of last years hate crimes were based on race or ethnicity.

They increased more than 20 percent, from 428 in 2015 to 519 last year. Those against blacks increased from 231 to 251; against Latinos from 81 to 83; against whites from 34 to 56; and against Asians from 19 to 22.

 22.3 percent were based on sexual orientation.

They increased about 10 percent, from 188 in 2015 to 207 last year.

 18.5 percent were based on religion.

"There was no significant rise in American hate crimes between 2004 and 2015, according to a new analysis from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). But the types of prejudice suspected in such incidents has shifted, with crimes peceived to be motivated by racial bias on the wane but those seen as motivated by gender or gender-identity bias spiking.

Despite the now-popular perception that bias-based violence is getting worse overall, the rate of violent hate crime victimization in 2015 was not significantly different from the rate in 2004, BJS reports. And this absence of a statistically significant change held true for violent hate crimes both reported and unreported to police.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) defines hate crimes as those that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, gender or gender identity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity.

The new BJS analysis report is based on data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), which relies on surveying a representative sample of U.S. residents, as well as the FBIs Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) survey, which includes crime reports from law-enforcement agencies. UCR data relies on the DOJ definition of hate crimes, while the crime-victimization survey includes crimes perceived by victims to be motivated by a bias related to race, gender, etc.

About 41 percent of people who reported hate crimes on NCVS surveys during 2003-15 said they filed a police report about the incident, and about 14 percent of these incidents (14,380) were designated by police to be hate crimes. The remaining 86 percent were classified as hate crimes in the NCVS because the offender used hate language or left hate symbols at the crime scene, the BJS notes.

In 2015, hate crime made up one percent of total incidents reported in the national crime survey. The most common type of suspected bias was based on race (48 percent)—down from 62 percent in 2007. Crimes perceived to be motivated by gender bias rose from 15 percent in 2007 to 29 percent in 2015.

Thirty-five percent of NVCS hate-crime reports in 2015 were perceived to be motivated by ethnic bias, 29 percent by gender bias, 22 percent sexual-orientation bias, 17 percent religious bias, and 16 percent disability bias. The number one indicator of bias reported was the offenders use of hate language, according to BJS, reported by 99 percent of those who say they were victims of hate crimes.

Fewer than 1 in 10 hate crime victims reported that the offender left hate symbols at the scene (5 percent) or that the victimization was confirmed to be a hate crime by police investigators (7 percent). Overall, about 90 percent of NCVS-reported hate crimes involved violence, and about 29 percent were serious violent crimes (rape or sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault). ... The majority of hate crimes were simple assaults (62 percent), followed by aggravated assault (18 percent), robbery (8 percent), and theft (7 percent).

NCVS data does not contain info on crimes against businesses, churches, and non-private property. UCR data contains both these crimes and crime against persons and private property that were reported to police. Based on UCR averages, there were 8,370 offenses designated as U.S. hate crimes each year.",1

"‘It’s my happiness, and nobody is allowed to take it from me,’ Angelina Bouros says Tania Barricklo — Daily Freeman

ROSENDALE, N.Y. >> It’s taken a long time, but Angelina Bouros says she finally is happy with her life and her place in it.

And she’s determined to not let anyone take that away from her, ever.

“It’s my happiness, and nobody is allowed to take it from me,” the 56-year-old transgender woman said recently. “They’re not allowed.”

But someone did try to steal that happiness from her recently, leaving a hateful and obscenity-laced letter on her property one day while she was at work.

The letter, found by a friend staying at her home, stated in part: “I just found out that you used to be a man, and pretty good looking too, and now you are a woman. You FREAK! Your (sic) a disgrace to the neighborhood, thank god we live way up the road away from you and we don’t have to see you everyday. Your (sic) a f—king freak, all of you gays who fly those stupid rainbow flags are all freaks.”

It was signed “Your Fischer Avenue neighbor.”

Bouros said she was shocked that someone in the Rosendale neighborhood she calls home would leave her such a hate-filled rant. Until that moment, she said, she had lived without incident in the home she purchased seven years ago.

While she was saddened that someone who doesn’t know her could hold so much animosity and hatred toward her, she said she refused to let that person’s hate get her down.

She has too much joy in her life and optimism about the future for that, she said.

“People only have power over us of which we give them,” Bouros said. “People can’t have power over our thoughts and feelings unless we allow them to invade us. I won’t allow them.

“I’ve worked really hard over the years to build a life and build a really good life,” she said. “I won’t let anybody stand in the way of my dream. They’re not allowed.”

After speaking to Rosendale police — who are investigating the incident as a hate crime, Chief Perry Soule said Friday — Bouros set out to get to know her neighbors, knocking on each and every door on her street, letting them know who she was and what someone had said about her.

The response, she said, was overwhelmingly supportive and showed her the real meaning of love and acceptance.

“We were obviously met by people who were totally upset and bewildered that such a thing could happen in Rosendale,” she said.

Her neighbors, many who she didn’t know until she went to their homes, started flying rainbow flags in support of Bouros. One neighbor used her own money to buy lawn signs that read “Hate has no home here” that then were put up throughout the community.

And on Sunday, the community will hold a pot-luck get together designed to bring the neighborhood together and send the message that hatred and bigotry are not welcome in Rosendale.

As for the person who sent the hate-filled missive, Bouros hopes he or she is caught and then made to sit down with Bouros, talk to her and get to know her.

“It’s always my wish and desire to be optimistic and hopeful and positive,” she said. “This particular incident with this person wasn’t going to be treated any differently. I’m always looking to get the best possible outcome.

“This is my life and my journey, and I’m going to make the best out of it,” she said.",1

"A man in upstate New York admitted to spray-painting swastikas and hate messages on his own home.

Andrew King pleaded guilty last week in Schenectady City Court to falsely reporting an incident, which is a misdemeanor crime, the Albany Times Union reported Tuesday. He will be sentenced to three years of probation at his sentencing hearing in October, according to the newspaper.

King reported the vandalism on his home to police on Feb. 10. He was arrested after a five-week police investigation and pleaded not guilty at his arraignment. His report folowed several reports of anti-Semitic vandalism around the state.

“A falsely reported hate crime is in one sense as bad as a real crime,” Schenectady County District Attorney Robert Carney said in a statement. “It stigmatizes a group of people, increases fear and tensions, and could encourage real copycat crimes. Mr. King put our community on edge in perpetrating this hoax and we hope this disposition will provide him some needed supervision and assistance.”

"Jack Lessenberry for Friday, February 9.

I am both a human being and a journalist, and so I’m not surprised by most human frailties. I understand jealousy and greed and theft. I understand get-rich-quick schemes, sexual and romantic desires that aren’t always appropriate, and overeating.

But I don’t understand why anyone would attack and severely injure or kill anyone for their sexual orientation.

Children can be cruel, as anyone who remembers their days on the playground knows. But I’m not talking about them, or about troubled adolescents who are trying to figure out who they are and where they fit in to the scheme of life.

We’ve all been there, in one way or another.

No, I’m talking about adults like the ones who attacked, stripped, and severely beat a Muskegon teenager last year just because he was gay, or the man who shot a transgender woman in the face in Detroit because of who she was.

I am myself boringly heterosexual, what society considers normal and I consider an accident of biology. That’s the way I was evidently wired by the manufacturer. But I can’t understand why others like me feel justified in attacking those not like us.

What I do know is that a civilized society can’t tolerate this. Yet here’s what I find incredible and obscene. In Michigan, I could be convicted of a hate crime if I were to slash the tires of a black or Muslim colleague and paint racist slogans on their car.

But if I physically assault someone for being gay or transgender, that isn’t a hate crime. It would still be illegal, though it’s taken as a given in the gay community that police tend to do little to investigate crimes against them.

Last year, State Senator Steve Bieda, a Democrat from Warren now running for Congress, introduced a bill to expand current hate crime laws to protect gender or sexual orientation. But Senate Majority Leader Arlan Meekhof indicated the Senate wouldn’t even bother to consider the bill. The religious right doesn’t want government to do anything that would indicate sexual diversity is allowed, including protecting victims of hate.

Fortunately, there is a group that does: Fair Michigan, which was founded a few years ago to make sure all women and members of the LGBTQ community have proper legal protection.

They’ve also formed a unique justice project with the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office, a collaboration focusing on solving and prosecuting hate crimes against people in that community, even though the government doesn’t recognize them as such.

In little over a year, the Fair Michigan Justice Project has taken eleven cases through the courts. They’ve won convictions on every one.

Two nights ago, I was the keynote speaker at Fair Michigan’s annual banquet. I thought it was encouraging that a significant number of politicians were there, including gubernatorial candidate Shri Thanedar.

Someone asked me how this community could get the legislature to give them their civil rights by adding this community to those protected by the Elliott-Larsen civil rights bill. I told them today’s lawmakers would never do that, but I also said the question was wrong. “You have as many rights as anyone else,” I said. “You just have to make people recognize that you do.”

Which was, after all, the whole point of that other civil rights movement, half a century ago.

"LAKELAND, FL — A 75-year-old Lakeland mother is injured and her 53-year-old son dead following a Thursday night dispute that took a violent turn. According to the Polk County Sheriffs Office, deputies were called out to the Del Rose Drive North home of Marjorie Pacuicrk around 6:02 p.m. Nov. 10. Marjorie reportedly wanted assistance in getting her adult son, John Pacuicrk, to leave. Dispatchers asked Marjorie to wait outside the home for deputies, Sheriff Grady Judd said in a Thursday press conference. When deputies arrived, they met with Marjorie in the front yard and learned she had asked John for help in pushing her car to the backyard. John, Judd said, became angry, but agreed to help. When the car wouldnt budge, he became more upset and went inside the home. Marjorie followed him in and found that he had gone into his room and locked the door. She told him through the locked door she wanted him to leave, Judd said. Marjorie then decided to contact deputies for help. John, Marjorie told deputies, had a gun in his room. The deputies that responded to the home attempted to go inside and talk to John at that point, Judd said. While they were inside, however, they heard gunshots coming from the front yard. When they ran back outside, they saw two men fighting, rolling on the ground, Judd said. One of the men was John; the other his brother Theodore, 51. John had a gun in his hand, Judd said, and deputies told him to drop it. Theodore, who was not armed, jumped up, Judd said. John then jumped up and pointed the gun at Deputy Lee Smith. Smith, 23, and Deputy Bernardo Del Valle, 28, both shot at John, Judd said. The two performed lifesaving measures on John, but he was pronounced dead at the scene, Judd said. Marjorie was located hiding in a car in her front yard. She had been shot twice – once in each leg, Judd said. The preliminary investigation revealed that Theodore encountered John outside the home while the deputies were evidently inside and noticed he had two guns in his hands, Judd said. John reportedly told Theodore, Im going to kill her, while shooting at Marjorie several times. Deputies recovered two guns from the scene. Smith and Del Valle were both hired in January 2015. Four independent investigations are being conducted related to the shooting death. Marjorie Pacuicrk was last listed in stable condition, the sheriffs office said. Image via Shutterstock",0

"Islamic leaders are questioning Virginia detectives insistence that the beating death of a teenage Muslim girl appears to have been a case of road rage, saying the attack looks all too much like a hate crime.

Nabra Hassanen, 17, was bludgeoned with a baseball bat early Sunday by a motorist who drove up to about 15 Muslim teenagers as they walked or bicycled along a road, Fairfax County police said. A Hassanen family spokesman said all the girls in the group were wearing Muslim headscarves and robes.

A vigil for Hassanen was planned for Tuesday evening in Washington, D.C., CBS affiliate WUSA reports. The vigil was organized by D.C. Justice for Muslims Coalition, alongside the Womens Initiative for Self-Empowerment (WISE). Another vigil is also planned in her hometown of Reston, Va., Wednesday at 6:30 p.m.

Darwin Martinez Torres, a 22-year-old from El Salvador suspected of being in the U.S. illegally, was jailed without bail on a murder charge after the girls body was pulled from a pond near his apartment.

Police handout

Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on Islamic-American Relations, said there is a strong possibility the crime wouldnt have happened if the teenagers werent Muslim.

You cant just say, Oh, he didnt say anything against Islam, so no hate crime, he said.

Fairfax police, in their account of the attack, said that Martinez Torres and one of the boys in the group got into an argument, and the motorist chased the youngsters down and got out swinging the bat. They said Martinez Torres beat Hassanen as her friends scattered, then put her in his car, assaulted her again and dumped her body.

No evidence has been uncovered that shows this murder was motivated by race or religion, police said in a statement Monday night. It appears the suspect became so enraged over the traffic dispute it escalated into deadly violence.

But after a string of attacks on Muslims around the world, most recently in London and in Portland, Oregon, some are deeply skeptical.

Rabia Chaudry, a lawyer and Muslim activist who lives in the Washington suburbs, ridiculed the notion it was road rage, saying on Twitter: If you think for a minute that her appearance had nothing to do with this crime, youre lying to yourself.

Chaudry said that when a Muslim commits a crime, officials are quick to treat it as an act of terror, but when the perpetrator is not Muslim, police seem to approach it differently.

I just feel like there is more hesitation and a lot of other factors are taken into account, such as whether the person was drunk or suffering mental problems, Chaudry said in an interview.

The public defenders office, which was appointed to represent Martinez Torres, declined to comment. He could get up to 40 years in prison if convicted on the murder charge.

Meanwhile, Muslim groups planned vigils around the country Tuesday to honor Hassanen. And her mosque, the All Dulles Area Muslim Society, announced plans for her funeral on Wednesday and encouraged people to come together and respond to bad with good.

The mosque expressed optimism that law enforcement will determine what motivated the crime and added: We request the community to not speculate on the motives and jump to conclusions.

CAIR called on Muslim communities to increase security during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in light of Hassanens slaying and other recent crimes. The attack on Hassanen came as she was on her way to a mosque for Ramadan.

On Monday, British authorities charged a man with terrorism after he allegedly plowed his van into Muslim worshippers outside a London mosque, injuring at least nine people.

And in Portland last month, a man was charged with the equivalent of a hate crime in the fatal stabbings of two white men who were trying to defend two teenage girls, one of them wearing a hijab, from his anti-Muslim tirade.

In those cases, the suspects allegedly made repeated anti-Muslim slurs before and during the attacks. In Virginia, neither police nor witnesses interviewed by The Associated Press said they saw anything to make them think the teenagers were targeted over their religion.

Fairfax County police said if they find any evidence the slaying was a hate crime, they will pursue appropriate charges. Virginia law, in part, defines a hate crime as any illegal act motivated by a persons race, religion or nationality.

"After a white man reportedly tried to stab a black man while saying the N-word, the Harris County District Attorneys Office is charging the white man with a hate crime.

James Scott Lee, who is also a suspected member of the Aryan Brotherhood, a white supremacist prison gang, was arrested for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. He reportedly yelled, “I hate n——— and I’m gonna kill me one today, while trying to stab the victim — which is what led prosecutors to upgrade the charges to a hate crime.

“It can be difficult to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a person is motivated by racial hatred, but in this case, the defendant’s own words supply the evidence to charge him with a hate crime,” First Assistant District Attorney Tom Berg said.

According to the DAs office, the victim jumped into a car and locked the door in order to escape Lee. When Lee was arrested, police say, he also had brass knuckles.

On Wednesday, at the request of prosecutors, a judge raised Lees bond to $250,000 — more than eight times the normal amount for an aggravated assault case. Prosecutors said Lee is either mentally unstable, or has a deep-seated animosity toward African Americans, but poses a public-safety threat either way.

Instead of facing up to 20 years in prison, because of the hate-crime enhancement, Lee now faces life.

"It’s a time of high anxiety in the United States, but all that distress isn’t spread equally among us.

The 11th annual “Stress in America” report by the American Psychological Association, published Nov. 1 (pdf), found that women tended to report higher levels of stress than men this August. They rated themselves on average of 5.1 out of 10 for their overall stress levels, while men rated themselves at a 4.4.

The gap between genders is growing ever so slightly from the year before, when men rated their stress an average 4.6 and women rated themselves an average 5. And for the decade that the survey on over 3,400 participants has been conducted, women have been more stressed in general.

This is the first year that the APA has asked respondents to rate their stress over hate crimes, international conflict and terrorism. Women reported significantly higher stress levels than men: Compared with a quarter of male respondents, over a third of women said they were worried about the rise of hate crimes, terrorism and war.

We have a few ideas why this might be the case. Perhaps the stress comes from the public resurgence of white supremacy and violent demonstrations that occurred this summer in Charlottesville and other cities across the country. Perhaps it’s the sexual harassment and misconduct that have been happening for years across all sorts of industries, including Hollywood, Silicon Valley, and within the media. Perhaps it’s the horrific shootings and terrorist attacks that keep happening across the globe, most recently in lower Manhattan just yesterday. Perhaps it’s the rising tensions between the US and North Korea and the looming threat of nuclear war—although notably, the APA survey this year did not ask specifically about the effect of Donald Trump’s presidency.

In this year’s iteration of the survey, researchers asked people how they felt about the future of the country in general. In total, they found that 63% of Americans said they’re really worried, and 59% said that it’s the lowest point in the US’s history they can remember. In addition to hate crimes and war, people reported being stressed about healthcare, the economy, and their jobs.",1
"The hideous slaying of second lieutenant Richard W. Collins III on the University of Maryland campus did more than evoke heartfelt grief and sorrow over the snuffing out of a young, hopeful, and high achieving young man’s life. It also again cast an ugly glare on the gaping double standard in how black lives matter versus those of white lives. Let’s go through the agonizing, but by now all too familiar, checklist of things that are terribly wrong with how his death has been treated. First, there’s the alleged assailant, Sean Urbanski, a young white man. The tributes to Collins had barely poured out at Bowie State University, where he was days from graduating, when Urbanski’s attorney not only pled innocence for his client, but implored the court to release him on his own recognizance, provide alcohol and drug testing counseling, and monitor him during his release by GPS.

The request was denied. Then there are the charges. He is charged with first degree murder. So far so good. However, the irrefutable fact is that Collins was African-American, and Urbanski is white. He has a documented connection with an “Alt Reich: Nation” Facebook group, and there is absolutely no evidence of any provocation on the part of Collins to precipitate the murder. Now there’s the Alt-Reich group that he belonged to. Even this has been sloughed off as just a light-hearted, silly, fun-and-games attempt by some college guys to draw attention to the group. The founder of the group was given tons of ink to make the case that spewing racism and white nationalism as the furthest thing from the minds of those associated with the group, and presumably that includes Urbanski.

Then there is Urbanski. The predictable happened. He was immediately depicted by friends and associates as a quiet, unassuming, even good-natured fellow, who couldn’t hurt a fly. All expressed shock and surprise that this seemingly good natured, all-American, clean cut good guy could commit such a dastardly crime.

That’s not a small point. The image massage of the group as a harmless fun-loving, and satirical outing on social media by some thrill-seeking college students, not to mention the glowing depiction of Urbanski, almost takes off the table the charge that he murdered Collins out of racial malice. In other words, that the murder is a hate crime and he should be charged under state or federal law as a hate crime perpetrator. The Prince George’s County Attorney expressed doubt and hesitancy about the motive. The Justice Department has been stone silent on whether it will consider a separate hate crime prosecution of Urbanski. The argument is always why bring a hate crime charge in these cases, even if there is a racial intent? The assailant is already being charged with and will be tried on a first-degree murder count.

This badly begs the question. A hate crime enhancement in racial assaults and murders is on the books as a deterrent and punishment to racially motivated assaults and murder. The failure to bring hate crimes charges sends the dangerous message that hate crimes, especially hate murders, will not be punished as racially driven hate crimes, but won’t even be called that even when there is compelling evidence they are. And the incidences of hate crimes have shown no sign of diminishing. Year in and year out, the FBI’s annual reports on hate crime violence in America report thousands of them. There are probably thousands more that aren’t reported. A murder charge and a conviction in racially motivated hate attacks and murders alone is hardly a disincentive stern enough to curb hate crimes.

There is also evidence that white nationalist, white supremacist groups and the social media ravings of kooky unhinged hate mongers hold a perverse fascination for many white students on college campuses. Since Trump’s election, a CBS report found nearly 150 incidences of racist posters and fliers on college campuses in nearly three dozen states.

But even before Trump’s election ushered in a new era of hate, intolerance, and bigotry, hardly a week went by without a report somewhere of hanging nooses, white hoods, racist graffiti, racial slurs and taunts aimed at minority students. The colleges that have been called on the carpet for the racist acts read like a who’s who of American higher education. Clemson University, Auburn, Lehigh, Tarleton State, Texas A&M, University of Texas, Austin, University of Connecticut, Johns Hopkins, Whitman College, the University of Oklahoma, U.C.L.A., U.C. San Diego, and the University of Maryland, to name only a very handful. The Harvard University Voices of Diversity project found campuses rife with subtle and not-so-subtle “microaggressions“ against minority and women students.

The final insult. The Collins slaying quickly disappeared from the headlines.

Urbanski may or may not be charged with a hate crime. But the hesitation, doubt and apparent reluctance of officials to call racial hate racial hate, even when it’s murder, tells much about the glaring double standard in how hate crimes are dealt with.",1

"BRIGHTON, N.Y. -- The Rochester region has seen several hate crimes in the last few months.

That was part of a larger discussion at Monroe Community College about combating anti-Semitism in the community.

A panel including Mayor Lovely Warren, U.S. Attorney J.P. Kennedy and members of the Jewish faith community spoke about the hate crimes against the religion in recent months.

Incidents include the vandalism of the Jewish Cemetery in Charlotte as well as the bomb threats at the Brighton JCC.

The Holocaust Studies Chair at MCC Regina Fabbro says students are interested in discussing the topic openly.

I think what weve seen is students responding to whats going on in the larger community, Fabbro said. Theyre certainly responding to whats happening at the national level, but theyre also responding to whats happening locally and also on their own campus. So they want to have these dialogues, they want to have these conversations and were really happy to provide those opportunities for them.

"An Ankeny couple pleaded guilty this week to charges relating to mortgage fraud schemes, according to a news release from the United State Attorneys office in Des Moines. On Wednesday, Jamie Bowers-Danielson, 35, and Matthew Danielson, 35, both of Ankeny, pleaded guilty to bank fraud in connection with a mortgage fraud scheme to obtain a free house in Ankeny, court officials said. According to the written plea agreement, Matthew Danielson provided false information, including misrepresenting his marital status as single, to the mortgage lender. The purpose of providing the false information was to obtain a mortgage despite his lack of credit worthiness and to deceive the lender into failing to obtain his wife, Jamie Bowers-Danielsons, signature on the mortgage, which resulted in the mortgage being voided, authorities said. Bowers-Danielson admitted that she submitted false documents to the loan originator as part of the scheme. She also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud. Prosecutors said Bowers-Danielson used her position as a loan originator to help herself and others qualify for mortgage loans through fraudulent means. This included submitting false and misleading statements and documents to mortgage lenders and banks for the purpose of obtaining loans for herself and other borrowers for which they should have not qualified. The couple entered their pleas before Chief Judge James E. Gritzner of the United States District Court. Judge Gritzner scheduled a sentencing date of July 26, 2013, for the couple. They remain released on conditions pending sentencing. Conspiracy to commit bank fraud and bank fraud are punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to 30 years and a fine of up to $1 million. Receipt of proceeds obtained under false pretenses is punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to one year and a fine of up to $100,000.",0
"Package bombs have rattled the capital of Texas, putting residents on edge. On Monday, two package bombs exploded. In one blast, a teenager died. In another, just a few miles away, two women were wounded. It mirrors an incident in Austin from two weeks ago when a similar blast left one man dead.

Investigators believe that the bombings are likely connected, according to The Associated Press. They are also looking into whether or not race was a factor as all the victims have been either black or Hispanic. The victim of the first blast two weeks ago has been identified as Anthony Stephan House (pictured), a 39-year-old African-American man and the stepson of Freddie Dixon, a former pastor at a historic black church in the city, The Washington Post reported. Dixon was reportedly friends with the grandfather of the teenager who was killed.

“This is the third in what we believe to be related incidents over the past 10 days,” Police Chief Brian Manley said during a press briefing on Monday. He suggested that the bombings may be constituted as hate crimes. Later, he backtracked and stated that a motive has not been uncovered.

Declining to go into specific details about how the packages looked, Manley did say that they were “average-size” and box-shaped. None of the deadly packages actually went through the mail. Instead, they appear to have been left on doorsteps of homes.

One of the residents went out front, and there was a package on the front doorstep, Manley said of the first blast on Monday, which killed the teen and wounded a woman (neither of which has been identified yet.) They brought that package inside the residence, and as they opened that package, both victims were in the kitchen, and the package exploded, causing the injuries that resulted in the young mans death and the injuries to the adult female.

Mondays’ explosions happened just as music festival SXSW began kicking off.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton warned all residents to be cautious.

With three reported explosions in the Austin area, I want to urge all Texans to report any suspicious or unexpected packages arriving by mail to local law enforcement authorities. Call 9-1-1 immediately if you receive something suspicious. — Ken Paxton (@KenPaxtonTX) March 12, 2018

Manley warned residents that if they see a suspicious package to call 911.

"COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) — The Latest on the stabbing death of a visiting student at the University of Maryland (all times local):

7:30 p.m.

The FBI is helping to investigate the stabbing at the University of Maryland to determine whether it was a hate crime.

University of Maryland Police Chief David Mitchell said at a press conference Sunday that he sought the FBIs help after finding that 22-year-old Sean Urbanski is a member of a Facebook group called Alt Reich: Nation, where members post racially charged material.

Urbanski has been charged with first- and second-degree murder as well as first-degree assault in the death of Richard Collins III. Urbanski is white and Collins was black.

Mitchell said Collins was a senior, who was set to graduate on Tuesday. He was recently commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army.

6:45 p.m.

Charging documents say the student fatally stabbed at the University of Maryland was Richard Collins III.

The documents provided to The Associated Press say that Collins was standing with two friends near a bus stop early Saturday when he was stabbed once in the chest by Sean Urbanski.

Officials have said that Urbanski was a student at the University of Maryland and the victim was a student at Bowie State University.

The documents say that Urbanski approached the group screaming and said: Step left, step left if you know whats best for you. They say that Collins said no and then was stabbed.

Urbanski has been charged with first- and second-degree murder as well as first-degree assault for the alleged attack.

"A UN committee charged with tackling racism has issued an “early warning” over conditions in the US and urged the Trump administration to “unequivocally and unconditionally” reject discrimination.

The warning specifically refers to events last week in Charlottesville, Virginia, where the civil rights activist Heather Heyer was killed when a car rammed into a group of people protesting against a white nationalist rally.

The UN warns the US over racism, but this Trump-era bigotry is not a blip | Nesrine Malik Read more

Such statements are usually issued by the United Nations committee on the elimination of racial discrimination (Cerd) over fears of ethnic or religious conflict. In the past decade, the only other countries issued with early warnings have been Burundi, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Kyrgyzstan and Nigeria.

The United States has been warned under the procedure in the past when Cerd raised the issue of land rights conflicts with the Western Shoshone indigenous peoples in 2006.

“We are alarmed by the racist demonstrations, with overtly racist slogans, chants and salutes by white nationalists, neo-Nazis, and the Ku Klux Klan, promoting white supremacy and inciting racial discrimination and hatred,” said Anastasia Crickley, chair of the committee.

Quick guide What happened at the Charlottesville protests? Show Hide What happened in Charlottesville on 12 August? White nationalists gathered in Charlottesville, Virginia, to protest against a plan to remove a statue of Robert E Lee, the Confederacy’s top general in the American civil war. Demonstrators chanted racist statements, carried antisemitic placards and held torches during the “Unite the Right” rally, which was organised by white nationalist Jason Kessler. The march was met by anti-fascist demonstrators, and some skirmishes broke out before James Fields, 20, allegedly ploughed a car into a group of counter-demonstrators. Civil rights activist Heather Heyer, 32, died and others were injured. Fields has been charged with murder.

Donald Trump faced widespread criticism after he blamed “both sides” for the violence in Charlottesville. Although the Cerd statement did not refer to him by name, it called on “the government of the United States of America, as well as high-level politicians and public officials, to unequivocally and unconditionally reject and condemn racist hate speech and crimes in Charlottesville and throughout the country”.

Crickley also urged the US authorities “to address the root causes of the proliferation of such racist manifestations”.

Lecia Brooks, director of outreach for the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), a civil rights group, said the UN’s early warning underlined the need for American leaders to “clearly and unconditionally condemn hatred and bigotry”.

“It is a sad day when the president of the United States has so thoroughly failed to denounce white supremacism that UN experts must warn the US about the dangers of racism,” Brooks said.



“Unfortunately, Trump’s racist and xenophobic campaign, and his lukewarm condemnation of white supremacists, has heightened racial tensions in America to the point that it’s raising alarms in the global community.”

Sherine Tadros, Amnesty International’s UN representative, welcomed the UN’s move. “It is significant that the UN is speaking out publicly against the actions of the new US administration, which it so far has been reluctant to do,” Tadros said.

Jasmine Tyler, US program advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, urged the White House to heed the UN warning. “As a black woman raising a black son, and a human rights advocate, I can hardly believe the times we’re living in,” Tyler said.

“The Trump administration should take the Cerd’s early warning very seriously and rescind its decision to eviscerate the mandates and budgets of US civil rights institutions; end its attempt to exclude white nationalism from the federal government’s Countering Violent Extremism programs; and end immigration and refugee policies based on anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant sentiment.”

The warning was issued on 18 August but came to light on Wednesday, the day after protests outside a rally by the president in Phoenix, Arizona.

Trump used Tuesday’s event to portray himself as the victim of events in Charlottesville, branding journalists who “do not like our country” as the true source of division in America. He also accused the “crooked media” of “trying to take away our history and our heritage” and read out previous statements that he said condemned hatred, bigotry and violence.

And he complained that the media had not given him enough credit for condemning hate groups. “I said everything,” the president said. “I hit them with neo-Nazi. I hit them with everything. I got the white supremacists, the neo-Nazi. I got them all in there, let’s say. KKK, we have KKK. I got them all.”

The former director of national intelligence James Clapper later described Trump’s remarks as “downright scary and disturbing”. The former spy chief, who served under Democratic and Republican presidents, also called into question Trump’s fitness to serve.

“How much longer does the country have to, to borrow a phrase, endure this nightmare?” Clapper said on CNN.

Following Clapper’s remarks, the former British ambassador to the US, Peter Westmacott, compared Tuesday’s rally to Nazi Germany.



“Shades of 1933 Germany,” Westmacott tweeted, claiming Trump’s speech was “an invitation to autocrats” in countries without the US’s system of checks and balances “to play the same game more dangerously”.

Immediately after the rally, police said they used pepper spray to disperse protesters outside the rally – who numbered in their thousands, according to Arizona media – after being pelted with rocks and bottles.

The Phoenix police chief, Jeri Williams, told reporters that four people had been arrested, including three on assault charges.

In February, the SPLC said the number of hate groups in the US had risen for a second consecutive year and that “the radical right was energised by the candidacy of Donald Trump”. Until last week, his chief White House strategist was Steve Bannon, a rightwing ideologue and former editor of Breitbart, which Bannon called “a platform for the alt-right”. Bannon has returned to Breitbart News as executive chairman.

In its statement, Cerd also called on the US to ensure that the freedoms of expression, association and peaceful assembly are not exercised with the aim of destroying or denying the rights and freedoms of others, ensuring “such rights are not misused to promote racist hate speech and racist crimes”.

The committee monitors compliance with the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination, which the US ratified in 1994.",1

"CLOSE Florida man gets 15 years for using bacon in a hate crime. Elizabeth Keatinge (@elizkeatinge) has more. Buzz60

Michael Wolfe, seen here during a January 2016 court appearance, was sentenced Tuesday, Dec. 5, 2017, to 15 years in prison, followed by 15 years probation for vandalizing a Florida mosque with a hate crime enhancement. (Photo: Craig Rubadoux, Florida Today)

MELBOURNE, Fla. — A Florida man who broke into a mosque and left a slab of raw bacon now faces 15 years in prison after pleading guilty to charges, the state attorneys office said.

Michael Wolfe, 37, of Titusville, Fla., will serve 15 years in state prison, followed by 15 years probation for the January 2016 crime at the Islamic Society of Central Florida Masjid Al-Munin Mosque in Titusville. Prosecutors said the agreement was reached after discussions with the Islamic Society of Central Florida and Titusville police.

“He entered a plea deal and plead guilty to vandalizing the mosque itself with hate crime enhancement, making it a felony,” said Todd Brown, a spokesman for the State Attorney’s Office. “He waived his right to a pre-sentencing investigation.”

More: Man accused of vandalizing mosque, leaving bacon

Details of a motive were not released.

Wolfe pleaded guilty to criminal mischief to a place of worship with a hate crime enhancement Tuesday. The vandalism came as a growing number of similar mosque vandalism were taking place across the nation. Muslim advocacy groups had grown increasingly concerned about a wave of what they describe as anti-Islamic sentiment when the Titusville attack took place.

Police said Wolfe broke into the mosque, ripping down lights, smashing windows and leaving behind the pork product. Pork — including bacon and ham — is prohibited in Islam, a faith followed by 1.6 billion people worldwide.

Wolfe also offered to the court the fact that he was a habitual offender, Brown said.

Wolfe is prohibited from returning to the mosque — a condition of his probation. Other details of the probation were not immediately available.

In addition to criminal mischief, Wolfe was charged with armed burglary during his arrest. That charge was dropped in court.

“The agreement was to drop the armed burglary in exchange for his plea,” Brown said.

"A 35-year-old Rosemount man is facing multiple charges of criminal sexual conduct for allegedly taking photos and video of an eight-year-old girl. The charges cover a four year period beginning in 2007.According to a complaint filed by the Dakota County Attorneys office, Richard Michael Marquardt has been charged with five counts of criminal sexual misconduct in the second degree and one count of possession of pornographic work involving a minor. On January 20, the girl reported to her mother that Marquardt had been taking pictures of her while she was going to the bathroom. She also told her mother Marquardt asked her to wear a diaper and helped her take off her clothes. Her mother then reported the incidents to Rosemount Police, who launched an investigation. Marquardt and his wife are friends with the girls family, and had stayed overnight at their residence. The following day, the girl was visited by a social worker who was told Marquardt took pictures and videos of her wearing a diaper. She also complained that she had asked him not to take pictures of her while she was going to the bathroom. The girl also said she had later witnessed Marquardt downloading the pictures onto his computer. A search warrant was executed at his residence the same day, and a computer, digital camera, cell phone and associated media were seized. Marquardt was present during the search and told police he had taken a number of pictures of the girl wearing a diaper, but did not think the photos were inappropriate. Marquardt also admitted that he had been downloading images from online sites for ten to fifteen years.Marquardts children were removed from the residence and placed with a family member. A later examination of the computer found numerous photos of the girl, organized by date. Several of the videos showed the girl complaining that she had to go to the bathroom. There were also numerous photos of other unidentified children, as well as images of Marquardt and his wife wearing diapers. In a Feb. 1 follow-up interview with Rosemount police, Marquardt told the detective he was aroused by urination and diapers. He also admitted uploading a photo of the girl to an online web site. Marquardt was subsequently arrested and is currently in jail on $150,000 bail. His first court appearance was Monday.  An omnibus hearing including all the charges is set for Feb. 28.",0
"Two classmates at an Albuquerque, New Mexico high school have been suspended after they photoshopped KKK hoods on classmates surrounding a black student in the classroom, and posted it to Snapchat.

The local NBC affiliate reports that the students even went so far as to post the disturbing photo on the school’s official Snapchat group. It was removed, but not before it had been seen by several other students.

Mary Morrow-Webb, the mother of the African American child featured in the photo, told KOB, “It was awful,” she said. “It was frightening. I just really got sick to my stomach. I was afraid for my daughters and for the other children there that are at risk for these types of threats.”

“You don’t expect your kids going to school and having to deal with racism and discrimination in 2017,” Lamont Webb, the girls father said. “It’s kind of appalling.”

The two students who said they only posted the picture as a “joke,” were consequently suspended for 10 days. One of the students was also kicked off the football team.

“We took this to our police department,” Albuquerque Public Schools Superintendent Raquel Reedy told KOB 4. “They came and investigated and are really looking very carefully at whether we should file charges for hate crimes. This is something we’re looking at very carefully because it’s this serious.”

When they arrived, they found crews from the Sykesville Fire Department treating 35-year-old Leif Erik Foerter, according to police. Foerter was transported to Carroll Hospital Center where he succumbed to his injuries, according to a police report. Police said a Honda Accord traveling west on Piney Ridge Parkway entered into the intersection of Johnsville Road where it struck a north bound Jeep Wrangler. As a result of this collision, Foerter, who was driving the Jeep Wrangler, was ejected after impact. The operator of the Honda Accord was transported to Carroll Hospital Center with non-life threatening injuries, according to police reports. Speed, not alcohol, is considered to be a factor in the collision, police said. Charges are pending the outcome of the investigation, according to police. Anyone who may have witnessed the accident is asked to contact Corporal Jeff Miller at 410-386-5900",0

"H. Rick Bamman - hbamman@shawmedia.com Marlowe Middle School principal Adam Zehr and sixth grade literacy teacher Tricia Baltzersen discuss curriculum after classes on Thursday, Oct. 22, 2015. Zehr joined Huntley School District 158 four years ago as an assistant principal. A year later, he entered the mentorship program the district offers for new principals.

LAKE IN THE HILLS – A student charged with a hate crime and disorderly conduct also will face a Huntley School District 158 disciplinary process, Marlowe Middle School Principal Henry Soltesz said in a statement to parents Wednesday.

Police responded to Marlowe Middle School, 9625 Haligus Road, after a parent reported a threatening video to social media Oct. 19.

Police said students and staff were not in danger, but Reed Road schools in Lake in the Hills temporarily were placed on a soft lockdown.

A minor later was charged with a hate crime and disorderly conduct in connection with the video.

Soltesz said in a statement that District 158 officials won’t discuss details of the disciplinary process, but he said that it “is designed to apply the strongest appropriate consequences for the student responsible and to ensure the safety of the school environment going forward.”

The school district said it has measures in place to address hate, violence and bullying, including a hotline for anonymous reports, a student leadership team and a diversity and inclusion work group.

“Preventing bullying, appreciating differences in others and reporting threatening or inappropriate behaviors have been addressed with the whole school in many ways,” the statement read.

An anti-bullying speaker is scheduled to speak to Marlowe students during multiple assemblies Monday.

Soltesz also will speak to “reiterate that behavior that threatens or demeans another person for who they are will not be tolerated,” according to his statement.",1
"Payments giant PayPal will be rescinding its services from sites that accept payments or raise funds to promote hate, violence, and intolerance in response to Saturdays events in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Regardless of the individual or organisation in question, we work to ensure that our services are not used to accept payments or donations for activities that promote hate, violence, or racial intolerance, the company said in a statement.

This includes organisations that advocate racist views, such as the KKK, white supremacist groups, or Nazi groups.

In the statement penned by PayPals SVP of Corporate Affairs & Communications Franz Paasche, the company said it is dedicated to providing financial services to people with a diversity of views and from all walks of life, but is striving to navigate the balance between freedom of expression and open dialogue.

However, PayPal said it remains vigilant and committed to ensuring that its platforms are not used to perpetuate hate or intolerance.

We recognise and work to navigate the fine lines that exist in these situations, and our teams do their best to distinguish between opinion-based, offensive websites and those that go beyond opinion and discourse and violate our policies, Paasche wrote.

Lives lost due to hatred and intolerance are a tragedy for every person in our nation. The PayPal community was appalled by the events that transpired -- and our hearts go out to the people of Charlottesville and all who have been touched by this unacceptable hatred and violence.

Intel CEO Brian Krzanich was yesterday the third company chief to depart from United States President Donald Trumps American Manufacturing Council in the wake of the recent violence in Charlottesville.

Writing in a blog post, Krzanich said he was leaving to call attention to the fractured political environment in the United States.

Politics and political agendas have sidelined the important mission of rebuilding Americas manufacturing base, he wrote.

I have already made clear my abhorrence at the recent hate-spawned violence in Charlottesville, and earlier today I called on all leaders to condemn the white supremacists and their ilk who marched and committed violence.

I resigned because I want to make progress, while many in Washington seem more concerned with attacking anyone who disagrees with them.

The departure of Krzanich follows the earlier resignations of Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank and Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier.

Plank said he was resigning due to the presidents initial response to the Charlottesville protests.

His resignation came even after Trump made a statement on Monday explicitly calling out hate groups, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, and white supremacists, for their role in the unrest.

Plank said on Twitter that he was resigning to focus on inspiring and uniting through power of sport.

Earlier in the day, Frazier said that he was stepping down in protest.

With three CEOs cutting ties with Trump through his council, it was reported on Wednesday that Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell will remain on board.

While we wouldnt comment on any council members personal decisions, theres no change in Dell engaging with the Trump administration and governments around the world to share our perspective on policy issues that affect our company, customers and employees, a Dell spokeswoman is quoted as telling Axios.",1
"Members of the Ku Klux Klan face counter-protesters as they rally in Charlottesville, Virginia (Reuters: Jonathan Ernst)

The Ohio man accused of killing 28-year-old Heather Heyer by plowing his car into a crowd of protesters at the so-called Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville last August was indicted Wednesday by a Virginia grand jury on federal hate-crime charges.

James Fields Jr., 21, struck and killed Heyer after driving his car into a crowd of counter-protesters voicing their opposition to the hundreds of white nationalists who descended on Charlottesville to “defend” a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee. from removal.

Fields was indicted on one count of a hate crime resulting in Heyer’s death, as well as 28 counts of hate crimes causing great bodily harm in an attempt to kill and one count of racially motivated violent interference with a federally protected activity.

“Last summer’s violence in Charlottesville cut short a promising young life and shocked the nation,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. “Today’s indictment should send a clear message to every would-be criminal in America that we aggressively prosecute violent crimes of hate that threaten the core principles of our nation.”

The clash between white nationalists and counter-protesters sparked a national controversy after President Trump appeared to critics to paint the white nationalists in a sympathetic light by suggesting there were “some very fine people on both sides.”

Fields, who was described by a former teacher as having a preoccupation with Nazism, was photographed hours before the killing with a shield bearing the emblem of Vanguard America, a leading white-nationalist hate group. He is already facing a first-degree murder charge at the state level and has been in custody since the rally.",1
"SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CA -- Police in Santa Clara are warning the public about a phone scam involving MoneyPak or GreenDot reloadable cash cards that has victimized some residents in the South Bay. According to police, scammers call victims and pose as city or federal employees. They tell the victims that they owe money for a traffic ticket, income tax, warrant or a late utility bill. The scammers then request immediate payment, and suggest that the easiest way to resolve the matter is to purchase a MoneyPak or GreenDot reloadable cash card, which can be purchased at a drug and or convenience store. According to police, the cards are similar to cash and are not traceable. Once the victim provides the suspect with the number on the back of the card, they can immediately download the value of that card anywhere in the world. According to police, no legitimate business would ask someone to make a payment this way. Anyone who receives a call like this should hang up and call the companys customer service phone number on their bill.

"GENEVA, IL - A 21-year-old inmate being treated at Delnor Hospital stole a correction officers 9 mm handgun on Saturday afternoon and held, at one point, two nurses hostage. The Kane County SWAT team ended up rescuing one of the nurses who remained held at gunpoint and against her will by Tywon Salters, 21, in a hospital room near the emergency room at about 4 p.m., according to police and media reports. Salters was killed after a North Aurora police department officer fired at least one shot at him, the Aurora Beacon-News reports. The Illinois Police Public Integrity Task Force has now been requested to investigate the use of force during the officer-involved shooting, authorities said late Saturday. Salters, of Chicago, had been in custody at the Kane County jail since April 11, however jail records show he has been in custody since March 11. Salters was charged with possession of a stolen vehicle and was given a bail amount of $75,000.  Emergency personnel were first called to the hospital, 300 Randall Road in Geneva, at about 12:30 p.m. Sources said a rush of ambulances headed to Delnor early Saturday afternoon and helicopters could be seen hovering overhead. The extra ambulances were on hand to transfer patients needing immediate emergency care to other area hospitals. The incident began after Salters was taken to the hospital and was receiving treatment in a room on the third floor of the hospital, according to the Aurora Beacon-News. He was under guard by Kane Co. correctional officers and it was unclear why he was there or how he was able to wrangle a gun away from a correctional officer, Kane County Sheriffs Office Lt. Patrick Gengler told the Aurora Beacon-News. There were restraints in the hospital room where Salters was being treated. The hostage situation unfolded in a room near the first-floor emergency room at Delnor, the Daily Herald reports. The corrections officer was able to get away but Salters held a nurse hostage until she also managed to escape. Salters then left the room and took another nurse hostage, States Attorney Joe McMahon said during a Saturday night news conference. After negotiations between Kane County SWAT and Salters deteriorated, the SWAT team entered the hospital room to rescue the hostage victim, authorities said Saturday night. During entry, a Kane County SWAT member fired their weapon, striking Salters. Salters was pronounced deceased at the scene. WATCH: Footage from the scene of the Delnor Hospital hostage standoff: A member of the SWAT team was shot in the upper body and the bullet was lodged in his protective vest, according to the Daily Herald. Its unclear who shot the officer, Gengler said. The officer was treated and then released from the hospital. The nurse was not injured but other people suffered minor injuries during the incident, according to the Aurora Beacon-News. The main hospital was put on lockdown during the hostage situation and officials said patients were reportedly safe, police said as the hostage situation unfolded. Normal operations continued within the hospital but no one was allowed to go in or out at the time. The lockdown has since been lifted. The hospital began taking walk-ins again at 6 p.m. and ambulance service will resumed at 8 p.m. The weapon was recovered at the scene. An autopsy on Salters will be scheduled by the Kane County Coroner. An investigation is ongoing. Those at the hospital when it was placed on lockdown posted to their Facebook pages to share information and let their acquaintances know they were safe.

"Although the global community continues to reel with disbelief from news of Chechnya, institutionalized homophobia in Russia is far from new. The Chechen attacks, involving the detainment and killings of suspected gay men, represent a chilling progression of Russia’s well-documented homophobia. As Matt Baume comments in Slate’s Outward Blog:

The country has always been extremely hostile to queer people, but at some point in recent weeks, authorities began a large-scale rounding-up of queer men, bringing them to illegal prisons where survivors described being subjected to brutal beatings, electrocutions, and killings. In accounts corroborated by humanitarian organizations, victims reported that security forces tortured them to extract the names of other queer men. Many of those released now face the possibility of ‘honor killings,’ a practice whereby family members are expected to murder their queer or otherwise ‘dishonorable’ relatives.

Russia has long been regarded as notoriously homophobic. According to Immigration Equality, the nation’s leading LGBTQ immigrant rights organization, U.S. asylum applications from LGBTQ Russians fleeing persecution have increased over time:

As demand for our legal services increases, our legal team is facing an unprecedented number of open cases. Historically, Jamaica has been the source of the largest number of clients – with Mexico trailing closely behind. In 2013, when Russia passed its “anti-gay propaganda” law, we immediately experienced a sharp increase in calls from that country. Now, the number of Russian clients has eclipsed the number of Mexican clients.

Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a U.S. government-funded broadcasting organization, confirms this surge in Russian applications for U.S. asylum:

The number of new U.S. asylum applications by Russian citizens has jumped for the fourth straight year in 2016, reaching the highest level in more than two decades and more than doubling since President Vladimir Putin’s return to the Kremlin for a third term.

While the data does not indicate the basis for applicants’ persecution claims, immigration attorneys link this multiyear surge to policies in Russia seen as discriminatory toward sexual minorities, a squeezing of dissent during Putin’s third term, and widespread corruption.

In accordance with this trend, earlier this month, the Novaya Gazeta, a leading independent Russian paper, broke the story of Chechnya’s anti-gay extermination. This initial report confirmed the detainment of hundreds of suspected gay men in prisons likened to ‘concentration camps,’ as well as the death of at least three men.

The Guardian has since published accounts of the grisly Chechen anti-gay campaign which has already seized and tortured an estimated several hundred men in the ultra-conservative Russian republic:

At least once a day, Adam’s captors attached metal clamps to his fingers and toes. One of the men then cranked a handle on a machine to which the clamps were linked with wires, and sent powerful electric shocks through his body. If he managed not to scream, others would join in, beating him with wooden sticks or metal rods. As they tortured him, the men shouted verbal abuse at him for being gay, and demanded to know the names of other gay men he knew in Chechnya.

Rather than provide relief, Russian authorities have reportedly reacted to the murders with callous disinterest:

Thus far, officials closest to the violence have reacted with disinterest. A spokesman for Ramzan Kadyrov, head of the Chechen Republic, told reporters that ‘you can’t detain and repress people who simply don’t exist in the republic.’

The Chechen authorities continue to deny the presence of gays in Chechnya - instead arguing their existence has been “invented by opposition media.”

Most recently, Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov accused international organizations of spreading false information:

Kadyrov says international organizations are conducting a ‘massive information attack … using the most unworthy methods, reality is distorted, attempts are being made to blacken our society, lifestyle, traditions and customs.’

President Trump’s revised order stands in stark contrast to global events. Horrific human rights violations, such as the Chechen attacks, indicate an escalated urgency for the U.S. to provide safe haven to persecuted people. The U.S. must act accordingly.

The U.S. government needs to publicly condemn the Chechen attacks as an advancement of Russia’s longstanding history of anti-LGBTQ oppression, push for immediate intervention from Russian authorities, and continue to grant U.S. asylum and refugee status to persecuted people in desperate need of safety.

“When faced with such crimes of hate and inhumanity, it is the responsibility of every person of conscience to speak out — to oppose this campaign of violence before it continues further.” - Joe Biden, former U.S. Vice President in a recent statement.

"By Kaye Kory

We all know that we are living in volatile times, and the FBI’s recently released data on the national incidence of crimes motivated by bias (in other words, hate crimes) reinforces that perception. This report showed a very unsettling increase in hate crimes since last year. FBI records show 6,121 incidents were reported by police in 2016. Compare this to the 2015 data, when 5,850 incidents were reported. We see a nearly 7 percent increase which tells us that Americans are demonstrating their prejudices in public in growing numbers.

While 7 percent may not seem particularly alarming, a breakdown of the character of these crimes motivated by bias does give cause for alarm. Approximately 58 percent of these attacks were motivated by racial bias, about half of which were directed against African Americans. 21 percent of the crimes reported were motivated by the victim’s religion; in more than 50 percent of the incidents the victims were Jewish, and a quarter were anti-Muslim.

The sharp increase in the number of hate crimes aimed at Muslims is painful to see, but not a surprise given the inflammatory anti-Muslim rhetoric coming regularly from our president since his campaign for the office first began. Hate crimes against Muslims jumped 67 percent in 2015 and again rose about 20 percent last year. Racially motivated crimes against Arabs grew 38 percent over 2015. 2016 has the highest number of hate crimes targeting Muslims since the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001. Crimes attacking transgender people went up 44 percent. Although the FBI does not present conclusions in its report, before he left office Director James Comey commented that “…hate crimes are [very] different from other crimes. They strike at the heart of one’s identity.” Hate crimes are meant to humiliated and intimidate, as well as physically hurt a victim.

Hate crimes reveal an ugliness that is hard for us to admit and address as a society. But in order to begin to slow the rise of these attacks, we must first work to collect reliable and uniform data. Reporting criteria is not at all uniform from state to state, and neither is the thoroughness of the reporting. Aside from the reluctance of victims to report hate crimes, prosecutors find proving hateful intent is sometimes difficult, as intent is not easily demonstrated even though much of our criminal justice system is based upon doing so.

This brings me to House Bill 10, which I have filed for the 2018 session. The current Virginia Code defines ‘hate crime’ as a crime with a restricted motivation: racial, religious or ethnic bias.

Clearly these motivations do not include many of the biases driving Americans to shockingly discriminatory violence today. Therefore, I have updated the description of those likely to be discriminated against to read “..harassment or violence motivated by racial, religious, gender, disability, gender identity, sexual orientation or ethnic animosity.” This broadened language applies to both the crime committed and to the clarity of police reports. We cannot adequately address the current groundswell of hate crimes unless we collect data that reflects reality and report criminal charges accordingly.

"The investigation into the death of an Iowa teenager that drew the attention of Attorney General Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsThe Hill’s 12:30 Report — Kavanaugh accuser willing to testify | Kavanaugh denies allegations, says he’s willing to testify | 50 days from the midterms Ken Starr backs Mueller, says president must be held accountable The Hills Morning Report — Sponsored by United Against Nuclear Iran — Kavanaugh confirmation in sudden turmoil MORE ended Friday with a guilty verdict for 23-year-old Jorge Sanders-Galvez.

Sanders-Galvez was charged with first-degree murder for the death of Kedarie Johnson, a self-identified gender-fluid 19-year-old who was murdered. According to The New York Times, Sanders-Galvez became enraged with Johnson during sexual intercourse upon discovering Johnsons biological gender. Johnson was shot twice and choked with a plastic bag.

A second man, Jaron Purham, is also facing a murder charge in Johnsons death.

Sessions and the Justice Department responded to the investigation by sending an experienced hate crimes prosecutor to assist with the case and convening a grand jury to look at possible hate crime charges, according to the Times.

Such charges would have to be brought at the federal level, as Iowas hate crime statutes do not recognize gender-fluid individuals. Efforts by LGBT advocates to add gender-fluid individuals to the state laws died in the legislature last year, the Times reported.

Johnsons mother told the Times that she hopes her childs death will be prosecuted by the Justice Department as a hate crime.

“I’ve said that it was a hate crime since the day this all happened,” Katrina Johnson said. “And I do feel like it’s important that that be said.”",1
"WEST COVINA, CA—Eight people were injured in a three-vehicle collision in West Covina during a chase of a possible DUI suspect that ended after a man ran a stop sign, according to a police spokesman. The collision took place at the intersection of Francisquito and Walnut avenues about 8 p.m. Monday, West Covina police Officer Rudy Lopez said. The chase began when officers in a black and white tried to make a traffic stop on a white Acura driven by 26-year-old Robert Lopez of La Puente who tried to outrun the police, Officer Lopez said. When the Acura got to the intersection of Francisquito and Walnut, Lopez ran the stop sign and crashed into two vehicles that were already at the intersection, he said. A white Nissan Maxima driven by a woman with her 7-year-old and 8-month-old daughters was heading northbound on Walnut when the Acura hit them. The 8-month-old girl was last reported in serious condition, Lopez said. The current condition of her mother and sister was unknown this morning. The other vehicle was a Ford Expedition in which two women and two men were inside. There was no word yet who was driving. All four people were injured and taken to hospitals, Lopez said. Their conditions were unknown. Lopez, the alleged drunk driver, also was injured in the collision. He was taken to a hospital for treatment. After his release, he will be booked for alleged felony DUI causing injuries and alleged felony evading, Officer Lopez said, adding that the investigation on the collision will be handled by the California Highway Patrol.

"Racist flyers began to circulate on Friday night falsely linking a New Jersey mayoral candidate with terrorism.

Ravi Bhalla, who is running for mayor of Hoboken, posted a photo of the flyer on Facebook. It has a picture of Bhalla, a Sikh who wears the traditional turban, with the words “Don’t let TERRORISM take over our Town!” directly above him.

The flyer also warns of a “potential conflict of interest” regarding the city’s water supplier, which is a client of the law firm where Bhalla is a partner. That issue, however, has no connection with terrorism and the explanation of the conflict appears in much smaller print.

“Of course, this is troubling, but I want to be clear: We won’t let hate win in Hoboken,” Bhalla wrote on Facebook. “I want people to know that Hoboken is a welcoming community where my wife and I are proud to raise our two young children.”

Sikhs have repeatedly been the victims of hate crimes and harassment by people who mistake them for Muslims. A 2015 study conducted by the National Sikhs Campaign found that 20 to 28 percent of Americans misidentify Sikh men as Middle Eastern or Muslim. A large part of that is due to the turbans that Sikh men wear as part of their faith.

Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) tweeted in defense of Bhalla to denounce the flyers. Booker served as mayor of nearby Newark from 2006 to 2013, before running for Congress.

“My friend @RaviBhalla is running for Hoboken mayor,” Booker wrote. “This vile hateful flyer was put out. I condemn it! We all must condemn bigotry & hate!”

This isn’t the first racist incident during New Jersey’s local elections this year. Xenophobic mailers circulated earlier in the week over a school board election in Edison. They featured two Asian-American candidates with the word “deport” stamped on their pictures. The anonymous flyers also claimed, “The Chinese and Indians are taking over our town!”

The flyer falsely tying Bhalla to terrorism showed up just days before voters go to the polls on Tuesday. Language on the flyer claims it was paid for by a rival mayoral candidate, Michael DeFusco, who denies any association with the item.

“I condemn this piece of racist garbage in the strongest possible terms,” he said in a statement. “Political stunts like this are everything that’s wrong with politics today.”

"The two very modest men are almost embarrassed by the attention and gratitude they are receiving since they risked their lives last Tuesday to save the lives of two others involved in a fiery car crash. However, Monday night, once again the spotlight was set on Manchester Police Officer Gerad Gonzalez, who lives in , and Des Peres resident Joe Caruso. With their wives, children and parents by their sides, both men were honored by the City of Manchester. As previously reported by Patch, Gonzalez and Caruso risked their lives to pull an unconscious man from a burning car right before it exploded. It all happened after a fiery crash at Dougherty Ferry and Carman roads. (The rescue, crash scene and events that unfolded afterward were all caught on the police dash cam video in this article.) Monday, Gonzalez, a 16-year veteran of law enforcement, was honored for heroism, while Caruso, whose 15-year-old daughter was with him at the time of the crash, received an honor for citizen bravery. Both men tell Patch they do not consider themselves the heroes that many residents have called them since that night. Training took over and thats why I did what I did, Gonzalez tells Patch. He said he did not expect a proclamation of heroism for his efforts. I was overwhelmed. As long as Caruso was awarded, thats all I care about. Caruso, a CBC graduate, also tells Patch he never expected such attention for his actions. Very strange when I saw my picture on the news, Caruso said. I obviously dont think of myself like that. Im just a normal dad, a normal husband. Im fortunate that everything worked out all right. A sentiment that is shared by their familys, especially both wives, that say they are so proud of their husbands, but think about that night and how it could have ended differently. I didnt know what emotion I was feeling. I was scared, I was sad. The next day I was mad, Gonzalezs wife Tammy explained. My initial reaction was my heart just sank, Bridget Caruso said when she learned of the incident. Our whole family was kind of in shock that night. It was very surreal. And every day it sank in, and sank in, how our lives could have changed that night. In fact, Caruso and his daughter were at the scene when the crash happened and narrowly missed being struck by the Chevrolet Tahoe that had already caught fire. His daughter tells Patch she told her dad not to go to the burning vehicles. However, with no one else there yet, Caruso went to the cars, first helping the female driver who was trapped inside a Chevrolet Blazer engulfed in flames, then helping Gonzalez save the Tahoe driver. Very proud. Just the bravery, Bridget Caruso tells Patch of her husbands actions. Gonzalezs wife Tammy said the same. Although such a situation is unsettling, shes nothing but proud of her husband. So honored to be his wife, she tells Patch. Download the movie",0
"RICHMOND, Va. — The man accused of plowing a car into a crowd of people protesting a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing a woman and injuring dozens more, now faces federal hate crime charges.

The Department of Justice announced that an indictment returned Wednesday charges James Alex Fields Jr., 21, of Maumee, Ohio, with 30 crimes, including one count of a hate crime resulting in the death of Heather Heyer, and 28 other hate crimes involving an attempt to kill dozens of other people who were injured. Another charge accuses him of racially motivated violent interference with a federally protected activity.

Last summers violence in Charlottesville cut short a promising young life and shocked the nation, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. Todays indictment should send a clear message to every would-be criminal in America that we aggressively prosecute violent crimes of hate that threaten the core principles of our nation.

Authorities have said Fields, described by a former teacher as having a keen interest in Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler, drove his speeding car into a group of people demonstrating against the Unite the Right rally Aug. 12 that drew hundreds of white nationalists to the college town, where officials planned to remove a Confederate monument.

Fields already faces state charges including first-degree murder and is set to face a jury trial later this year. He has been in custody since the rally. The attorney representing Fields on those counts declined comment Wednesday.

The car attack came after the rally had descended into chaos — with violent brawling between attendees and counterdemonstrators — and authorities had forced the crowd to disband.

The eight-page indictment alleges Fields decided to attend the rally on or before Aug. 8. As he prepared to leave to travel to Charlottesville, a family member sent him a text message urging him to be careful, the indictment said.

Fields replied, Were not the ones who need to be careful, and attached an image of Hitler, according to the indictment, which also says Fields used social media to promote racist views.

Fields then attended the rally Aug. 12, engaging in chants promoting white supremacist and other racist and anti-Semitic views, the indictment said.

After authorities forced the crowd to disband, Fields drove his car toward the area where a racially and ethnically diverse crowd had gathered to protest, the indictment said.

Fields rapidly accelerated, through a stop sign and across a raised pedestrian mall, and drove directly into the crowd, it said.

In a statement, FBI Special Agent in Charge Adam S. Lee of the Richmond Division thanked the business owners and Charlottesville residents who he said worked with us and provided a massive volume of evidence in this case.

The federal civil rights case is not the first under Sessions Justice Department, but it is certainly the most high-profile one. Critics of Sessions for the last year have been concerned about what they see as less aggressive enforcement of federal civil rights laws, and especially the Justice Departments lack of intervention against local police agencies with troubled relationships with minorities.

But in bringing the prosecution, Sessions appeared to assert himself as independent from President Donald Trump — who blamed the violence on both sides and was accused of emboldening racists — and suggested that the Justice Department would continue to treat racially motivated acts of violence as hate crimes.

"NASHVILLE, Tenn. - A man has been accused of harassing two Muslim girls and then threatening their father with a knife.

According to an affidavit from Metro Nashville Police, the incident happened after the two sisters, both McGavock High School students, got off the bus on Lebanon Pike.

He said f***ing Muslims, go back to your country, we dont want you here, said 14-year-old Fardowsa Hayer, one of the sisters the man verbally attacked. I was actually really scared, I don’t know where this came from. I don’t even know the guy.

Luckily, the girls father was driving home at the time and saw the man following his daughters.

When I came and asked him what is going on, the guy tried to fight back with me, said Abdull Ali. He pulled a knife, and tried to hit me many times.

The suspect – identified as 32-year-old Christopher Beckham – allegedly repeatedly told the family they were “not welcome in America” while swinging a pocketknife and his fists at Ali repeatedly.

Police said an altercation ensued and both he and Beckman fell to the ground.

The father and daughters got into their car, where they called 911 and followed the suspect until police arrived.

If I was not there, the children would be hurt, Ali said. He would have stabbed the children. I was the one who saved the kids.

Officers arrested Beckham and found the bloody knife. While in the squad car police said Beckham vowed to go back and kill the family when he gets out of jail.

He was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and two counts of misdemeanor assault. Beckham was booked on a $20,000 bond.

ST. JOSEPH, Mo. -- A 16-year-old girl and her mother believe a group of boys beat her up for being gay, according to WDAF.

Nylea VanHoutan and her mom call the attack on the young girl a hate crime.

VanHoutan says minutes after she and her three female friends left a pumpkin festival at a park, a large group of teenagers began to antagonize them.

It was like 20 to 30 of them. They were high school kids because one of my friends said something like she had seen them at school, VanHoutan said.

But when she and her friends refused to fight and tried to continue walking to her uncles house, she says the boys suddenly hit her in the back of the head, then punched her in her face and gave her a black eye.

It was like in shock, really in shock, she recalled. And when they did it, they called me a wanna-be boy expletive.

The high school junior is convinced the boys attacked her because shes a lesbian.

Im pretty sure it happened because I was queer, she said. Its not okay, its wrong.

Her attackers ran off and she was treated at a hospital. Her mom, Sescha Hicks, contacted police.

Super angry as a mother. I believe down to the core of my bones it was a hate crime, Hicks said.

According to the research from the 2015 national youth risk behavior survey, 34 percent of lesbian, gay and bisexual students said they were bullied on school property. Twenty-eight percent were bullied electronically, and 10 percent were threatened or injured with a weapon on school property.

Three days after the attack, VanHoutans right eye is still purple and a little swollen. Police are asking anyone who knows anything about the assault on the teen to call the St. Joseph Police Department.",1

"Rabat- Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West (Pegida) disrespected Muslims during Ramadan. The anti-Islam movement recently roasted pigs in front of Laleli mosque in Holland’s Rotterdam city at the time of breaking fast.

Pegida took advantage of Islam’s restriction on the consumption of pork, as it is regarded as “impure,” to provoke Muslims not only in the Dutch province but worldwide.

Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Omer Celik strongly condemned the act, severely criticizing Rotterdam’s mayor, Ahmed Aboutaleb, especially because he a Moroccan Muslim, calling his decision to grant permission for the action “immoral.”

This is so far the most immoral attempt ever in the history of hate crimes. Granting legal permission to such an immoral activity is also another deficiency of morality. — Ömer Çelik (@omerrcelik) June 6, 2018

Mr Abutalib, from a Muslim family, says that organizing a demonstration is a fundamental legal right. Since when disrespect to mosques has become legal right? Any disrespect to mosques, churches, synagogues is a hate crime. There cannot be any law which would allow hate crime — Ömer Çelik (@omerrcelik) June 6, 2018

Other municipalities in the Netherlands did not allow Pegida to roast pigs in front of mosques at the fast-breaking time. However, Ahmet Abutalib, Mayor of Rotterdam, who is of Moroccan origin, thinks that this activity of Pegida is not against the law. Such a gross tragedy! — Ömer Çelik (@omerrcelik) June 6, 2018

Celik compared Aboutaleb with other mayors such as the Hague’s mayor, Pauline Krikke, who banned Pegida’s barbeque party at the As-Soennah mosque in the city.

Turkish Muslim organizations in Rotterdam lay flowers around the mosque as a symbol of peace against hate crimes.

Celik stated on his Twitter account prior to the peace demonstrations that “flowers against the odour of hate” would be “a true lesson of humanity.”

Turkish and Muslim organisations in Rotterdam will hold an activity at the same hour to lay flowers around the mosque and will erect a wall of love with flowers against the odour of hate. This is a true lesson of humanity. — Ömer Çelik (@omerrcelik) June 6, 2018

Rotterdam newspaper Algemeen Dagblad reported that Pegida had planned to roast the pigs in front of various mosques in the Netherlands, in Arnhem, Gouda, Utrecht, and the Hague, and Rotterdam during the Ramadan iftar (the breaking fast time) until the evening prayer.

Earlier in June, Pegida shared a series of posts on Facebook, encouraging its followers to participate in the notorious barbeque in front of many mosques.

One post reads: “We have good surprises for mosque Utrecht…behold!”



“The barbecues will start every evening at 8:30 p.m. Anyone who brings their own plate and cutlery and a good anti-Islam mood is welcome,” a previous post read, according to Netherlands news outlet NL Times.",1
"San Francisco – a city well-known as the home to many legendary LGBT activists and a mecca for the gay community – lost one of its most adored icons in the early hours of Saturday morning. Bubbles – also known as Anthony Torres – was shot and killed outside the New Century Club in San Francisco’s Tenderloin neighborhood.

Bubbles was a figurehead in the city’s underground dance music scene and a dance floor legend loved by many. She could often be seen DJing with her portable DJ equipment near the RS94109 record store, a store which was on the same corner where she was killed.

Josh Cheon, Boss of Dark Entries Label based in RS94109, commented on the spirit and life Bubbles brought to San Francisco’s scene:

“If you were lucky enough to meet Bubbles you would never forget her, a true artist in every meaning of the word. Not of this time or planet, she was always full of the most positive energy she would excitedly share stories about launching a new fashion line, discovering a Severed Heads B-side and throwing a party in an underground space all in the same conversation. San Francisco lost one [of] the best and will never be the same.“

Several people took to Twitter and Bubbles’s Facebook page mourning the loss of their friend. They shared images, videos, and artwork.

Stephane Taurel wrote,”Bubbles was and will remain our friend because in all the things we thought he was, he choose to help us to feel free . We, I mean all his friend have a mission now, it’s to keep his spirit alive”

The San Francisco Police Department has been putting time and resources in keep the trans community safe and hope that this heartbreaking event isn’t a trend. Bubbles’ attorney Jim Reilly is firmly labeling the murder as a hate crime and states that the loss of the activist will not be taken lightly.

Bubbles was an eclectic, fun-loving and truly “bubbly” figure that will be missed dearly in San Francisco. Several LGBT icons have come from San Francisco including Harvey Milk, Margaret Cho, José Sarria, Lou Sullivan and many more – and Bubbles, too, is a star among them.

"Nantucket’s African Meeting House Vandalized with Racist Graffiti

The incident occurred between Saturday evening and Sunday morning, according to police, and is being investigated as a hate crime.

Get a compelling long read and must-have lifestyle tips in your inbox every Sunday morning — great with coffee!

The African Meeting House on Nantucket was defaced with racist graffiti over the weekend, and police are investigating the incident as a hate crime.

On Sunday, residents woke up to find the n word, the word “leave,” and what appeared to be a phallic symbol spray-painted across the historic site’s front. The incident occurred between 4 p.m. Saturday and 6:45 a.m. Sunday, and police are canvassing the neighborhood to get to the bottom of the crime, according to a press release. Community members gathered early Sunday morning to wash the graffiti off the building, The Inquirer and Mirror reports.

The vandalism shocked the Nantucket community, and Charity-Grace Mofsen, the manager of the African Meeting House, told the Boston Globe that the incident made it feel “like nowhere’s safe. … We’re still dealing with the same issues that you would find in the South, or the small-town Midwest. It’s everywhere.”

On Twitter, the Museum of African American History said it was working to remove the graffiti. The organization, “speaks out firmly against the tide of this form of hate.”

On Sun, Mar. 11, the African Meeting House on Nantucket was defaced. Now we begin the process of cleaning & restoring the building. MAAH speaks out firmly against the tide of this form of hate.

Massachusetts had the highest rate of reported hate crimes in the nation in 2016, according to the FBI and WBUR, with nearly six incidents per 100,000 residents. Of the 414 reported hate crimes, 212 were motivated by race, ethnicity, or ancestry. State Sen. Julian Cyr, who represents Nantucket, implored the community to recognize that hatred can bubble up anywhere: “Take a good look,” Cyr wrote on his Facebook page. “This isn’t some far off place—this is racist terror in my district. Nantucket woke up this morning to its African Meetinghouse attacked in the most vile and heinous of ways.”

According to 2016 population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, 10 percent of residents on Nantucket identify as black or African American.

The Meeting House dates back to 1827, and the building was originally used as a church, school, and gathering place on segregated Nantucket, according to the Museum of African American History. Today, the building hosts exhibits and programming on the history of the African American community on the island.

“Crimes such as this are not what Nantucket is about,” the police department said in a press release. “Nantucket is known for its diverse population and celebrates the diversity of cultures that make up this island community.”",1
"OAKLAND, Calif. — LeBron James issued a searing and personal response to the discovery of racist graffiti spray-painted outside his Los Angeles home early Wednesday, using a news conference to deliver a somber soliloquy about race in America on the eve of the NBA Finals. James explicitly placed his social standing ahead of preparation for perhaps the most anticipated series of his career.

“I think back to Emmett Till’s mom, actually,” James said. “That’s one of the first things I thought of. The reason she had an open casket was that she wanted to show the world what her son went through as far as a hate crime and being black in America. No matter how much money you have, no matter how famous you are, no matter how many people admire you, being black in America is tough. We’ve got a long way to go, for us as a society and for us as African-Americans, until we feel equal in America.”

Police said the n-word had been spray-painted across the front gate of a home James owns The LAPD said it would investigate the vandalism as a hate crime and examine security camera footage from nearby homes to identify a suspect. James lives in the house in the offseason, and he and his family were not living there at the time.

James said his family is safe, “and that’s most important.” But the crime visibly rattled him. At his news conference at Oracle Arena, where his Cleveland Cavaliers will open their title defense in a third consecutive Finals meeting with the Golden State Warriors on Thursday night, James appeared shaken but resolute. He wore a white T-shirt emblazoned with a photo of Muhammad Ali’s face. He measured his words and frequently paused to swallow hard.

“Obviously,” he said, “you see I’m not my normal energetic self.”

James also seized the incident as an opportunity to prove how extensive racism remains in America. If somebody of James’ stature is not immune to a potential hate crime, James reasoned, the graffiti showed the pervasiveness of hate. In that way, he welcomed the maliciousness.

RACISM ‘ALIVE EVERY SINGLE DAY’

“As I sit here on the eve of one of the greatest sporting events that we have in sports, race and what’s going on comes again and on my behalf and on my family’s behalf,” James said. “But I look at it as, if this can shed light and continue to keep the conversation going on my behalf, then I’m OK with it. … It just goes to show that racism will always be a part of the world, a part of America. Hate in America, especially for African-Americans, is with them every day. Even though it’s concealed most of the time, people hide their faces, say things about you. When they see you, they smile in your face. It’s alive every single day.”

“Surprising, no,” James later added in an interview with ESPN. “I still understand how race plays a part in America. For me to be here and have to answer questions about racism, it just lets me know that it’s still here, and we should all know that. If it takes for someone to spray my gate and use that derogatory term, that hate, on my family to shed a light on what the real issue is in the world, then so be it.”

While James has become a willing megaphone for social causes in the second decade of his career, he had difficulty processing the potential effect on his family. The primary source of his consternation, he said, was being away from his three children, a daughter and two sons.

“The most unfortunate part is that I can’t be home right now,” James said. “I can’t be home to see my kids. My little girl is actually too young to understand it right now. I can’t sit in front of my boys right now, and I won’t be home until next week. It’s kind of killing me inside right now. My wife is unbelievable, my mother, my mother-in-law, my sister-in-law, they’re going to do a great job when they get home from school today.

“At the end of the day, I’ll be focused on (Thursday), on our game plan and focused on these games. I’m at a point in my life where my priorities are in place, and basketball comes second to my family. I will be as focused as I can be on the job at hand (Thursday). This is a situation where it puts me back in place as far as what’s actually more important. Basketball is not the most important thing in my life.”

AND NOW THE GAMES

Teammates asserted their belief the incident would not affect James, who willed the Cavaliers to Cleveland’s first championship last season by reversing a three-games-to-one series deficit against the Warriors.

“I know ‘Bron. I know how locked in he is,” Cavaliers forward Tristan Thompson said. “Nothing like this is going to affect his psyche in terms of the Finals. Obviously, the world is crazy nowadays. People have bad intentions. We just got to be there for him and know he’s a tough guy.”

“It’s unfortunate,” said Cavaliers forward Richard Jefferson, one of the league’s most respected veterans. “He does such a great job of not letting those things be a distraction. It sucks, not only for him as a grown man. I think he can handle that. But that feeling of wanting to make sure your kids feel safe, that your family feels safe, I think that is the part that is most frustrating as a man.

“We deal with these types of things on a daily basis. The things that we’ve seen and had to deal with, a lot of times they might not even get picked up on.”

On Wednesday, James was both downbeat and an eager messenger. He also vowed his focus would be on basketball by tip-off Thursday night.

“It will pass,” James said. “That’s fine. I’m figuring it out. I’m thinking about my kids a lot.”

"The men used the app to coax men into sharing their home addresses so they could barge in and rob them.

Last year, four men used Grindr to target gay men to rob them. On Monday, the last two of those men were sentenced to prison time.

According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Anthony Shelton, 20, and Cameron Ajiduah, 19, were sentenced to 20 and 15 years in prison respectively for charges of home invasion for violently robbing gay men in Texas. Two other defendants, Nigel Garrett, 21, and Chancler Encalade, 20, were previously sentenced to 15 years and 10 years, respectively.

“For each of the four home invasions, the defendants used Grindr, a social media dating platform for gay men, to falsely identify as a gay man and arrange to meet the victim at the victim’s home,” the Justice Department said in a press release. “Upon entering the victim’s home, the defendants assaulted the victim, restrained the victim with tape, and made derogatory statements about the victim being gay. The defendants possessed a firearm during each home invasion, and they stole the victim’s property, including his motor vehicle.”

The men were together charged in four separate similar home invasions in Plano, Frisco, and Aubrey, Texas. They all pleaded guilty to the crimes, which took place from January 17 through February 7, 2017.

“This case highlights the danger of the internet and specifically, online apps,” said U.S. Attorney Joseph D. Brown for the Eastern District of Texas. “In this case, the defendants misused the internet for sinister purposes in order to target an innocent man based on his sexual orientation, causing him bodily harm and damage to his property.”",1

"(Newser) – A 31-year-old man was charged Tuesday with second-degree homicide after he allegedly drove over two young men at a Washington campground, one of whom later died. But the Quinault Indian Nation believes he should also be charged with a hate crime. Based on a firsthand account from a tribal youth, the Quinault Indian Nation says the driver was screaming racial slurs and war whoops when he ran over the two tribal members around 1:30am Saturday, reports the Seattle Times. Grays Harbor County Police say a white pickup truck drove into Donkey Creek Campground near Hoquiam and began doing doughnuts. After campers tried to intervene—a rock was possibly thrown at the truck—witnesses claimed the driver tried to run them down, police tell Q13.

Police say the driver then backed over 20-year-old Jimmy Smith-Kramer, a father of twin toddlers who was celebrating his birthday, and 19-year-old Harvey Anderson, before speeding off. Smith-Kramer died later at a hospital, while Anderson was released from the hospital Sunday with a bruised lung and cracked sternum. He tells KREM that Smith-Kramer tried to push him out of the trucks path. Im still wondering why this happened, he says. We didnt deserve this. A white male was arrested and his pickup truck seized Tuesday. But though the Quinault Indian Nation says police interviewed the tribal youth who described hearing racial slurs, police say no witness has been able to tell us that there were any racial slurs thrown out. (Police say the killing of four white men was a hate crime.)

"RICHMOND, VA — A 2-year-old Virginia girl who has been missing for eight months has been identified as the dead child found recently in a suitcase near train tracks in New Jersey. TeMyah Plummer has been identified as the toddler whose remains were found two weeks ago in the suitcase near the PATH tracks in Jersey City, according to NBC 4 New York and RLS Media. She and her father, Travis, were missing from Richmond, Virginia, since August 2017. Authorities arrested Travis Plummer, 37, on April 19 in San Juan, Puerto Rico, CBS News reports. Plummer is charged with desecrating the human remains of his daughter; a cause of death has not been determined. Authorities dont believe she died in New Jersey. The Richmond Police Department had been asking for the publics help to locate the father and daughter. A month ago, detectives said they did not believe the two were in danger. We would like to hear from whomever may be caring for TeMyah Plummer, probably a family member, Major Crimes Sergeant Frank Scarpa said in a Facebook post. We need to confirm that she is safe. The Hudson County (New Jersey) Prosecutors Office also had been seeking the publics help in identifying the baby. The investigation is ongoing and pending the medical examiners report, Raymond Worrall with the Hudson County Prosecutors Office told Patch. The baby was found April 11, shortly after 12:30 p.m., when the Port Authority Police Department received a report of suspected human remains being recovered near train tracks in Jersey City. The suspected human remains were found in a suitcase by a Port Authority employee during a routine inspection.

Saw this headline out of Boston about the latest alleged hate crime, and it caught my attention:

Store owner says she has no idea who sprayed the hateful graffiti. https://t.co/rTTBc4HifU https://t.co/1tDOiMQ9pA — NBC10 Boston (@NBC10Boston) April 19, 2018

Hateful grafitti? What was written that was hateful? Apparently “White lives matter“:

A market in Roxbury, created to help black-owned businesses in Boston, has been targeted by hate. The words “White Lives Matter” were spray painted on the Black Market in Dudley Square. Kai Grant owns the Black Market with her husband, Christopher. She’s unclear exactly when the graffiti was spray painted, but says Chris was taking photos of both a fence and the wall to share with the Mayor’s office for revitalization, when the discovery was made.

“I have no idea who it was,” Kai said. “That’s a question I’ve been asked all day.”

Wednesday, Boston Police Officers were at the Black Market taking a report and investigating. They say an investigation is underway. The market opened last year. Kai and Christopher rent space to black owned vendors so they can sell items.

It’s a business plan designed to bring back black owned and operated stores in Boston.

“As a cooperative pop-up, we’ve had so much love and so much support that when you feel this and this rage, this passive aggressive rage you kind of don’t comprehend it at first,” she said.

“This is our neighborhood,” she said. “I’m not going to walk around here scared. I’m not going to be intimidated by folks, us having pride in our heritage and proud to be black is something that everyone should celebrate.”

The owner calls the vandalism a racial slur.

“It’s a slap in our face, this is the epicenter of the black community in Boston. It’s the sentiment of privilege that I think folks are afraid of the story not being about them.”

First of all, it’s on the side alley of the building. If someone wanted to write something “hateful” on your building, they’d probably do it out front. Instead they did it behind a fence, which means no one can see it except for people who get high in that particular ditch. The owners themselves claim they randomly found it themselves.

Vandal Sprays White Lives Matter on Bostons Black Market https://t.co/qRK1xdspgd pic.twitter.com/3DVCQDj5KE — Patch Massachusetts (@PatchMass) April 19, 2018

Secondly, the fact that “white lives matter” is now hate speech, is the most insane yet hilarious thing I’ve seen from SJWs to date. Almost as crazy as “white lives matter” being considered a racial slur. SJWs just can’t stop crossing new thresholds of wokeness by labeling anything they don’t like as hateful.

Thirdly, where are the cameras? Look at all the businesses located in this densely populated neighborhood:

Not one of them caught these hate crime perpetrators in action?

Fourthly, it would be incredibly stupid and dangerous for a white person to try to pull this off in Dudley Square. This is one of the least diverse places in Boston, in that most people are black. A white guy walking into that neighborhood at night with the intention of defacing a black owned business in a heavily black neighborhood would be a suicide mission.

Fifthly, the store is having its grand opening this weekend:

What are the odds that something like this would happen, giving them insane amounts of free press/advertising, while making them sympathetic victims that woke folk would want to support with their hard earned money?

Sixthly, the store owner brags about how she’s gonna overcome this incredible act of hate and not be scared. Very brave of her. Of course statements like this will ultimately just lead to more people wanting to give her their money, not because they want to buy what’s in the store, but because they want to support this sympathetic victim of “hate.”

Seventhly, let’s suppose just for a moment that “white lives matter” was a hate crime. How do we know a white person did this? Why are we jumping to that conclusion? Because this will without a doubt help this black owned market economically. They will get more customers from this, so the motive is there for someone who works there to do it, but not there for a white racist to do it.

That’s why I’ll bet you any amount of money this is a hoax. That’s why they didn’t deface the front of the building – because they didn’t want to ruin it. Now they want a mural to be painted on the building, and guess who’s gonna be hired to paint the mural? Hint – it’s not gonna be a white guy. Roxbury is covered in cultural murals, none of which look like they were painted by Jackson Pollock.

This is how the racism-industrial complex works. Professional “activists” make up fake racism. They get the MSM to fall for it and profit off of it because it gets clicks. They play the victim and politicians like Marty Walsh cave to them because it’s bad optics not to. Then one of their friends gets paid by the city to paint their doodles on the building because they can’t find legitimate work on their own. Marty Walsh gets paid, the cops get paid, the media gets paid, the perpetrators of the fake hate crime get paid, and of course somehow Didi Delgado will get paid out of this. Without racism millions more people would be destitute.

Ya know what’s racist? Having a place called the “black market.” A place that only rents spaces to “black owned vendors.” Can a white business open up shop there? Nope. This is known as “discrimination.” Oh wait, turns out reverse racism isn’t a thing according to this woke ass post they put up in the aftermath of the unspeakable act of hatred:

“We knew it was coming. We knew it was only a matter of time.”

Of course you did. Because you knew you were going to do it yourselves. Duh.

Notice how she plays the whole, “we live in the most racist city in America” card too. That’s to attract dumb, naive, guilt ridden wypipo who have bought into this false narrative that Boston is somehow inherently more racist than any other city. Funny how no one says Philadelphia is a racist city. Just that Starbucks IN Philadelphia.

She’s doing the whole “we will not be shaken thing” once again to show how strong she is:

Also, please stop in and buy shit. Even though they don’t care about profit:

Which is weird, because the entire purpose of a business is to profit.

They kept going…..

The second you mention “white privilege” I already know your agenda. Obviously no rational person believes in this easily debunked theory of nonsense that’s designed to give people an excuse for failing. When we asked Jamarhl Crawford how much he would pay to switch places with a white guy, he said $0. Because that’s how much white privilege is worth – $0.

But she’s right – reverse racism is a myth. It’s actually just called “racism.” And it’s alive and well amongst people of all colors. If you don’t think there are people out there who genuinely despise all white people, just check out some of the commenters underneath the post:

“I’m ready to start hexing these white peoples.”

Yup, that chick is totally NOT racist. She’s just trying to “hex” an entire race of people because of the words “white lives matter.”

Oh, and the idea that on average white people in Boston make $250,000 while black people make $8 is the fakest of all the fake news. They of course learned this by reading the Boston Globe’s series on race. The same newspaper that employs Kevin Cullen, who is actively lying about having second hand PTSD from the marathon bombing he wasn’t at five years ago.

Also, the Chinese, Vietnamese, and Latinos are privileged too:

Yea, everyone know that Chinese and Latino people are never the victims of racism in America.

Ever.

“White people get your peoples yo.”

Oh yea, this woman sounds credible for sure.

Her post has bee shared hundreds of times though:

Also known as “free advertising.” That would cost a lot of money to pay Facebook to get that many eyeballs on their page, and they figured out a way to do it organically. It’s brilliant actually. We could use a fake hate crime to get some page views back too. Just kidding, we only do real news.

And of course Talcum X himself has been summonsed:

Which was smart, because this is 1,000% Talcum X red meat. He will eat this shit up and share it so fast your white privilege (and his) will explode!!

They also tagged the MSM, because obviously they’re gonna fall for it as well. Keep in mind, it was NBC themselves that referred to this as a hate crime. That was their choice of words.

The whole point of this is to get white people to come to Dudley Square and buy shit. Because people in the neighborhood are going to support it. But they need some of that white guilt reparation cash from Brookline and Newton to start flowing in. And it’s working like a charm:

Racism-industrial complex FTW!!

If you wanna see what their agenda is, just check out some of the hundreds of images they’ve posted here on their Facebook page. Personally, I’ve found a lot of this stuff to be racist so I’ve done my due diligence and reported them to Facebook for hate speech. Feel free to do the same. No one should be spreading racism and lying about hate crimes in order to make money. It’s not nice.

"U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch talks about hate crime in America based on the FBIs newest figures on reported incidents for 2015, as well as recent reports on hate crimes and harassment around the country on Nov. 18, 2016. (Published Friday, Nov. 18, 2016)

The majority of hate crimes experienced by U.S. residents over a 12-year period were not reported to police, according to a new federal report released Thursday that stoked advocates concerns about ongoing tensions between law enforcement and black and Latino communities.

More than half of the 250,000 hate crimes that took place each year between 2004 and 2015 went unreported to law enforcement for a variety of reasons, according to a special report on hate crimes from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Hate crimes were most often not reported because they were handled some other way, the report said. But people also did not come forward because they didnt feel it was important or that police would help, according to the report.

Based on a survey of households, the report is one of several studies that aim to quantify hate crimes. Its release comes as the Justice Department convenes a meeting on Thursday with local law enforcement officials and experts to discuss hate crimes, including a lack of solid data on the problem nationwide. Attorney General Jeff Session is scheduled to speak.

The new survey shows the limits of hate crime reporting, said Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State University.

Police have called the act a hate crime. (Published Wednesday, May 17, 2017)

Many victims dont report hate crimes because of personal and institutional reasons, Levin said. For example, some Latino immigrants may be reluctant to call police after an apparent hate crime for fear of deportation, he said.

Advocates fear that problem is worsening as the Trump administration ramps up immigration enforcement.

The report says Hispanics were victimized at the highest rate, followed by blacks.

I think this report shows the kind of fear that is going on in our communities, said Patricia Montes, executive director of the Boston-based immigrant advocacy group Centro Presente. She worries Latinos will even be more reluctant to report hate crimes in the future.

The new report said there was no significant increase in the number of hate crimes between 2004 and 2015. It cites racial bias as the top motivation, representing more than 48 percent of the cases between 2011 and 2015. Hate crimes motivated by ethnicity accounted for about 35 percent of those cases, and sexual orientation represented about 22 percent. Almost all of those surveyed said they felt they were experiencing a hate crime because of something the perpetrator said.

Law enforcement officials have long grappled with how to catalog hate crimes. While some victims distrust of police keeps them from coming forward, Levin said, some LGBT victims may opt not to report a hate crime for fear of losing a job or being outed to family.

Levin said many large cities are claiming they had no hate crimes — calling into question the reliability of federal hate crimes data that are based on voluntary submissions from police departments. We have Columbus, Ohio, reporting more hate crimes than the state of Florida, he said.

Eric Treene, the Justice Departments special counsel for religious discrimination, lamented the lack of solid data on hate crimes during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in May, saying incomplete numbers stymie officials ability to fully understand the problem.

But he said the department is committed to prosecuting hate crimes, even as critics have blamed the Trump administrations tough rhetoric and policies for a spike in such offenses. Civil rights groups said investigating and prosecuting hate crimes alone would be insufficient.

Its past time for the Trump administration and the Sessions Justice Department to demonstrate, through action and its megaphone, its full and unflagging commitment to preventing hate-based violence and harassment that hurts our communities and destroys the fabric of our nation, said Vanita Gupta, the top civil rights official in the Obama Justice Department and president of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.

"Atlanta Police made a large marijuana grow house bust on Monday afternoon at a house on Telford Terrace near Fairburn Road.  The small house inside the nice Glen subdivision, held nearly 250 plants worth over $500,000 says investigators. According to Officer John Chafee, officers responded to an unrelated 911 call in the area of 3228 Telford Terrace in southwest Atlanta.  While on scene at that call officers noticed the odor of marijuana and determined that the odor was coming from 3228 Telford Terrace. According to the AJCs reporting, police have received several tips about the house and it was on Sunday that officers responded to the area on a separate call and noticed the smell.  Investigators went to the home and tried to contact the residents, but no one answered the door. A K-9 was brought to the area and indicated from the roadway that drugs were in the house, wrote the AJC. Officer Chafee told reporters that, officers served the warrant around 12:00pm (Monday) and upon searching the home they discovered a large marijuana grow operation.  There were a minimum of 250 marijuana plants growing inside the home.  Due to the size and amount of plants, investigators say, the value of the marijuana is estimated to be approximately $500,000. A resident who also lives on Telford Terrace, Chris Collins, told Fox 5, yeah, you could smell it every day. You smell it like its next to you. The grow house setup was one that seems pretty elaborate from the police descriptions.  The police say, the plants were in four rooms of the house and divided according to size, and that, an irrigation system had been set up to hydrate the plants. Surprisingly no arrests were made and investigators are still working at identifying all of the suspects and obtaining arrest warrants. Should marijuana be legal?  Would that decriminalize the industry so that grow houses like this would not be hiding in our neighborhoods? Tell us your thoughts in the Comments Section Below.

"On Stan Lee’s Lucky Man Season 2 Episode 2, when a murder takes place outside of a London gay club, Harry and Suri are called in to investigate. Initially the evidence points to Shawn Blake, which leads to a church ran by a Reverend Huxley.

Meanwhile Isabella is continuing to try and teach Harry about the Bracelet, but Harry continues to resist the temptation of using it. Eve the woman that put the bracelet on Harry pays Isabella a visit and tries to warn her off, but unfortunately for Eve Isabella has some dirt on her.

Having followed up on Shawn Blake, Harry and Suri pay a visit to Reverend Huxley. A series of mind games starts in which Huxley tries to get under Harry’s skin. Harry takes an instant dislike to Huxley and knows in his bones that something isn’t right, but he has no proof.

When a second murder takes place, the victim is revealed to be a member of Huxley’s church and is wearing the same tattoo, which the first murder victim had recently had removed. The tattoo happens to match up with the stein glass ceiling window of Huxley’s church.

After running a background check on Huxley, Suri finds out that he was a psychiatrist who got struck off for cruel and unusual treatments of gay patients. This revelation only fuels Harry’s determination to bring Huxley down.

While on a break from the investigation Harry spends some time with Isabella who is on the top floor of a hotel. Isabella continues to try and coax Harry into using his bracelet and proceeds to jump off the building to illustrate her point.

Harry pleads with her not to jump, but when she does one of the maintenance lifts happens to prevent her from falling.

Back on the case, Harry breaks into the building where Huxley used to work and accesses the records, which have the full reports of why Huxley was struck off. He then takes this to Suri and they both proceed to bring Huxley in for questioning.

During the questioning, Huxley revealed that he was once gay and has spent his time since trying to cure other gay people via the use of religion.

As the conversation develops further we learn that the murderer is one of Huxley’s flock who the first murder victim was trying to help.

We also learn that the second victim was the murderer’s wife who was involved in trying to make him straight. In order to draw him out. Harry lets Huxley go free and tails him.

At the church the murderer goes after Huxley, but Harry is eventually able to apprehend him.

Harry still feels that Huxley and his methods are to blame for the deaths and feels cheated at not having been able to bring him in.

We then see Huxley out walking the streets only to get hit by a van.

In other developments, we learn that Golding has supposedly been sighted — which has led Harry to put a police protection detail on his ex wife and daughter.

Lucky Man: Questions we’re left asking",1
"Last week, he allegedly shot and killed a homeless man and a dishwasher heading to his job, both of whom were black. He was also accused of firing a gun at a black family’s house (although no one was injured). And now investigators claim they found a speech by Adolf Hitler in the suspect’s home, adding further evidence about what his motives were.

Kenneth James Gleason, 23, will be charged with first-degree murder for killing two people in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Interim Police Chief Jonny Dunham said that he was “confident that this killer would have killed again” if he had not been caught and apprehended.

According to the Associated Press, police found the copy of a Hitler speech while they were searching Gleason’s home. And DNA on shell casings, investigators told AP, also link him to the crime, along with other evidence.

The evidence certainly suggests that the shootings were hate crimes. Asked whether race was a motive, a spokesperson for the police department told the AP, “We’re not completely closed off to that. We’re looking at all possibilities at this time, so we’re not going to just pinpoint that.”

The local prosecutor, District Attorney Hillar Moore, said his office could pursue the death penalty. If so, additional hate crime charges wouldn’t do much to the case — since, after all, you can’t add a penalty further than death.

“It appears to be cold, calculated, planned [against] people who were unarmed and defenseless,” Moore told the AP. “We don’t need to prove motive. There are a lot of things that are unanswered.”

Still, as white supremacist protesters march into US cities and commit more horrific acts of violence, the topic is getting more attention. There seems to be a sense that the election of President Donald Trump, who made racist remarks and pandered to white supremacists, has emboldened racists. And there is increasing demand on law enforcement to do something about it.

Are hate crimes on the rise? It’s hard to say.

One of the key concerns in cases like Gleason’s, if it represents a hate crime, is whether these types of violent acts are on the rise.

There have been reports of more of these incidents. In the month after Trump was elected, there were more than 860 reports of hate attacks to the Southern Poverty Law Center — including school teachers making Islamophobic comments, students telling Latino peers that Trump would deport them, and outright physical violence that was seemingly motivated by racism.

There have also been reports of mosques being burned, violent attacks against Indians, and a drive-by shooting at the Tulsa, Oklahoma, headquarters for the LGBTQ organization Oklahomans for Equality. And then there were the white supremacist protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which a Nazi sympathizer allegedly killed a woman after he drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters. Not all of these attacks have been verified as acts motivated by bigotry, but they’re certainly a cause for alarm.

The reality, though, is it’s hard to say if hate crimes are on the rise, because the data used to track these cases is so poor.

Over the past two decades, the FBI reported between 6,000 and 10,000 hate crimes each year in the US. But when the US Bureau of Justice Statistics surveyed large segments of the population between 2007 and 2011 to try to gauge the real number of hate crimes, it concluded that there are nearly 260,000 such crimes annually.

So the FBI, although it’s supposed to be our most reliable source of current nationwide crime data, is potentially undercounting hate crimes by a magnitude of more than 40 times. Yet short of the BJS doing another in-depth survey and analysis on this issue, the FBI provides the best national data we have for more recent years.

This makes it difficult to know for certain if the number of hateful acts we have seen since Trump campaigned and was elected actually represent an increase in the total number of hate crimes. The hate crime experts I’ve talked to said there’s likely been an uptick given Trump’s rhetoric and support from white supremacists, but it’s impossible to say for sure without hard data.

What makes a hateful act into a hate crime

Louisiana has a hate crime law, but not all states do. While the federal government has a hate crime law that bans crimes based on race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability, some places don’t have such laws at the state level. That presents a major challenge: While the federal government will take on some of these cases, it doesn’t have the resources to enforce its law against all hate crimes nationwide — so a gap in state laws means some hate crimes will go unpunished.

If a state does have a hate crime law or federal law enforcement gets involved in a case, the important thing here is that someone must commit an actual crime to be charged with a hate crime. That crime can then be elevated to a hate crime if there’s enough evidence to suggest that the motive for the act was hate. But if no crime was committed in the course of someone doing something hateful, it’s a hateful act, but not a hate crime.

“It could be an act of trespassing or vandalism. It could be a violent crime, like rape or murder,” Jack Levin, an expert on hate crimes at Northeastern University, previously told me. “But when the motive involves targeting someone because of a difference, then it becomes a hate crime.”

An example: A man walks into a lesbian bar and attacks one of the women there. This attack would be considered assault and battery, maybe even attempted murder, under the law.

But would it be a hate crime? For a prosecutor and police officers, there would be several factors to consider before going after the perpetrator on hate crime charges: Did the attacker yell anti-gay or sexist slurs, or otherwise say anything explicitly anti-gay or sexist? Does the attacker have a history, perhaps on social media or in other writings, of homophobia or sexism? Did the attacker purposely target a lesbian bar, or was the location irrelevant to his actions?

Investigators would piece all of this together, building up evidence to decide if there’s enough to meet standards of proof for a hate crime charge and conviction. There’s no hard rule here, and whether something is deemed a hate crime can vary from officer to officer, prosecutor to prosecutor, judge to judge, or jury to jury. But generally, once there’s a certain threshold of evidence that the attack was motivated by hate, an otherwise run-of-the-mill crime can become a hate crime.

Now, if a man walked by a lesbian bar and simply yelled anti-gay slurs but didn’t attack anyone, that wouldn’t qualify as a hate crime. His speech, as reprehensible as it may be, would be protected by the Constitution. Until he commits an actual crime, his act can’t be additionally prosecuted as a hate crime.

The idea, essentially, is to take extraordinary steps against crimes that can go much further than harming individual victims. “If someone assaults me because they want my money, it’s going to affect me, it’s going to affect my wife, it’s going to affect my family,” Toni Bisconti, a University of Akron professor who studies hate crimes, previously told me. “But if someone assaults me because they know I’m gay, then all of a sudden it’s going to affect people that don’t even know me. They have no idea who I am. I’m just the conduit to gay people [in that situation].”

The focus on motives in these cases can get into some legally and philosophically murky territory: Does focusing so much on what’s in a criminal’s mind allow the government to regulate a person’s free speech and expression?

Bisconti acknowledged that such a concern has some merit. Although she said she probably comes down in support of hate crime laws, she acknowledged, “I’m not sure it’s right to legislate someone’s brain.”

Jeannine Bell, a scholar on hate crimes at Indiana University’s Maurer School of Law, took a different view, arguing that it’s not really about a person’s speech or ideas but the person’s actions. “It’s not just that you dislike people of my background. You’re entirely free to dislike people of my background. It’s not that you tell me that you don’t like me. Again, entirely free to do that,” Bell said. “It’s that you selected me for some sort of criminal action because of my background.”

Whatever one’s view on this debate, the central focus of hate crimes — what elevates them above other crimes — is the criminal’s motive.

This makes it very difficult to actually prosecute hate crimes. “The problem is not all hate-mongers are stupid,” Levin said. “They may not let you know that they hate the members of a particular group. They may realize that they’re better off not voicing a racial slur or [putting] racist graffiti on a sidewalk or wall of a building.”

For investigators, this is always going to make it difficult to definitively prove that an act is a hate crime. So while they might be able to land a conviction for, say, assault in the example of a man attacking a lesbian bar, they may not be able to get convictions for a hate crime.

Hate crime laws probably don’t deter crime, but they can still be valuable

Of course, none of this matters much if hate crime laws are ineffective. So I posed a question to experts: Do hate crime laws actually deter hateful acts?

Every hate crime expert I spoke to agreed that hate crime laws probably don’t deter any crimes. And they said there’s no good research settling this question one way or the other.

“I don’t think that perpetrators think about whether they’re going to commit a hate crime, look to see whether there’s a law that can be punished, and then don’t commit the hate crime when they learn it could be punished,” Bell said. “That doesn’t make sense to me.”

But experts said that it doesn’t matter if hate crime laws actually deter crime.

For one, hate crime laws do more than just enhance criminal penalties for committing otherwise typical criminal acts. They often devote funds to police departments — so they can, for example, set up an LGBTQ liaison who works closely with the community to ensure they feel safe. They also label these acts as a very specific kind of vile crime, encouraging law enforcement to take the issue more seriously.

“By making it a hate crime, you call attention to it in the minds of police [and] in the minds of prosecutors,” Bell said. She said, for instance, that most hate crimes are low-level — the kinds of crimes that police and prosecutors may not pay attention to. But once these low-level acts are defined as hate crimes, then they get attention.

Bisconti agreed: “Hate crime legislation allowed groups that don’t feel safe with police officers to come forward, and for police officers to understand that this really is a group that’s targeted.”

More broadly, hate crime laws also send societal signals against hate. Hate crimes are, experts said, message crimes against certain groups of people. Hate crime laws act as a countermessage to that bigotry.

“Hate crime laws have important symbolic meaning,” Levin said. “Hate crimes are message crimes — that is, they send a message not only to the primary victim but to every member of this group.” He added, “That’s the kind of message that has to be counteracted. And I think hate crime laws do that. They send a message to two groups: They send it to the perpetrator, informing him that our community will not tolerate his intolerance. And then at the same time, they send a message to potential victims that they are welcome in our community.”

In fact, to the extent that hate crime laws increase prison sentences, some of the experts I spoke to didn’t see much of the value in the enhanced penalties.

Levin, for one, cited the empirical evidence against expanding prison sentences. The research suggests that severity of punishment doesn’t do much to prevent crime. As the National Institute of Justice concluded in 2016, “Research shows clearly that the chance of being caught is a vastly more effective deterrent than even draconian punishment. … Research has found evidence that prison can exacerbate, not reduce, recidivism. Prisons themselves may be schools for learning to commit crimes.”

In other words, more certainty of punishment can deter crime, while more severity — through longer prison sentences — can actually make crime worse.

Generally, though, experts said that hate crime laws serve a purpose even if they don’t do much to actually deter crime — by giving marginalized communities resources to fight back and sending a message to criminals that bigotry isn’t accepted.

And with murders like those in Louisiana and events like those in Charlottesville, many people in these communities are finding such laws much more valuable.",1

A new report finds that anti-Muslim bias in the United States has increased considerably in recent years. Looking at reported hate crimes against American Muslims from 2016 to 2017, researchers at the Council on American-Islamic Relations noted a 15 percent spike.

The CAIRs methods include monitoring media (including email, calls, and an online complaint system) and recording incidents of anti-Muslim bias, harassment, and other hate-fueled actions.

The report cites several individual case summaries of the direct effects of bias, including hate crimes in New York, intimidation in California, denial of service in Michigan, an anti-mosque bombing in Minnesota, and other events occurring nationwide.

The CAIR cites the election of President Donald Trump, his Muslim ban, and what the report describes as xenophobic rhetoric as catalysts for the marked uptick of anti-Muslim sentiment in the U.S. political climate and in daily life. A CAIR lawsuit on the ban says Trumps actions are arbitrary and capricious, shock the conscience, violate the decencies of civilized conduct, and are so brutal and offensive that they do not comport with the traditional ideas of fair play and decency.

(Chart: Council on American-Islamic Relations)

Perhaps the most worrying statistic, however, is the number of incidents that the CAIR found to be instigated by government agencies: It has increased from 540 incidents in 2016 to 919 incidents in 2017, accounting for 35 percent of all anti-Muslim bias incidents recorded in the U.S. in 2017.

The CAIRs report provides recommendations to mitigate bias and harassment: Individuals can offer support and encouragement to Muslim friends and acquaintances, and elected officials can push for laws that protect minority groups.",1
"Now that school has started, drivers need to remember to follow a few rules of the road that have had the summer off along with students in New Jersey. And forgetting those rules — and being caught doing so — could carry stiff penalties for motorists or, even worse, cause a serious accident.

Kids run the greatest risk of being hurt when theyre standing at the bus stop, according to school officials.

Heres what you need to know — and what you should do — when you see a bus stopped with its flashing lights and extended stop-sign arm, or you are driving by a school: The Law: In New Jersey, the driver of a vehicle approaching a school bus must stop no less than 25 feet from vehicle. The driver must stay stationary until each child has entered the bus. The driver also must stay stationary until each child exiting the bus has reached the side of the road, and until a flashing red light is no longer exhibited by the bus. On highways having dual or multiple roadways separated by safety islands, the driver of a vehicle on another roadway approaching a school bus must reduce the speed of his vehicle to no more than 10 miles per hour, and cannot resume normal speed until the vehicle has passed the bus. The car cant resume normal speed until the car has passed any child exiting or entering the bus. The Penalty: First-time offenders are subject to fines of not less than $100, imprisonment for not more than 15 days or community service for 15 days. The Motor Vehicle Commission may also revoke the license to drive a motor vehicle of any person found guilty. The Law: Under state law, the speed limit for school zones typically is 25 mph, regardless of what the speed is for the road the school is on. Local authorities, however, may by ordinance designate a reasonable and safe speed limit that is less than or greater than 25 mph after an engineering and traffic investigation. The Penalty: For most speeding violations, the motorist faces up to 15 days in jail and/or $50 to $200 in fines. And for willful speeding violations—meaning the driver was knowingly breaking the law—license revocation is possible. Fines are, however, double for speeding offenses where the driver exceeded the posted limit by 20 miles per hour or more (or ten miles per hour or more in a 65 mile-per-hour zone).

"HAWTHORN WOODS, IL – A Hawthorn Woods Police Department officer on routine patrol in a neighborhood came upon a fire and quickly jumped into action early Friday. The officer was able to quickly evacuate residents from the home before fire crews arrived to the home on Heather Lane at about 1:04 a.m. Friday, according to a news release from the village of Lake Zurich. Firefighters found the blaze coming from the deck area in the rear of the residence, village officials said. They were able to quickly extinguish the fire. The blaze did not extend into the home and no one was injured. Fire officials believe a discarded smoking material caused the blaze. The total damage to the home is totaled at $2,000.

"The FBI says its investigating whether Jeremy Christian, 35, will face federal hate crime charges in a deadly stabbing on a MAX train in Portland on Friday. Police said Christian used hate speech while verbally harassing two young women, one reportedly wearing a Muslim hijab, before the stabbing victims came to their defense.

The FBI is looking into whether to charge MAX stabbing suspect, Jeremy Christian, 35, with federal hate crimes.



But one expert told KATU those charges can be tough to prove.

The federal charges would come on top of the counts of aggravated murder, intimidation and being a felon in possession of a handgun that Christian already faces.

Christian is accused of stabbing three men, two of them to death, after verbally harassing two young women with an anti-Muslim rant aboard a MAX train in Northeast Portland on Friday.

Beth Anne Steele, a spokeswoman for the FBI, told KATU on Monday that she could not estimate how long the federal investigation would take.

It will take some time for a review of information and evidence along with consultation with prosecutors to determine whether federal charges will be filed, Steele said via email.

Portland police said someone pepper-sprayed Christian at the Rose Quarter MAX platform on Thursday.





A woman shot cellphone footage of the man, thought to be Christian, engaged in an expletive-filled rant aboard a MAX train that night.



F*** all you Christians and Muslims and f*** Jews. You can f****** die. Ill burn you at the stake just like you did my pagan ancestors, the man said. Im about to stab some mother f***ers. Call the police, I dare you.

At a free speech rally in April, Christian, draped in an American flag, yelled at protesters and journalists.

I am the dude that promoted shooting anyone that tries to disarm me, Christian said.

During the rally, he also reportedly shouted, Die Muslims! and was caught on camera making a Nazi salute. Christian shared the image of the salute on his Facebook profile, which includes an aerial shot of the Jonestown massacre for its cover photo.

One of his Facebook photo albums labeled good stuff shows a photo of Adolf Hitler next to a marijuana leaf.

Another picture he shared labeled Orange Jews satirizes the Holocaust.

And he once wrote, May all the Gods bless (Oklahoma City bomber) Timothy McVeigh, a TRUE PATRIOT.

Hating someone is not a crime, Greg Vecchi, a retired FBI agent with 29 years of federal investigative experience, told KATU on Monday.

Vecchi is also a professor of criminal justice at Missouri Western State University.



You can hate someone, a Christian, a Muslim. You can hate someone whos black, someone whos white, Vecchi said. That by itself does not trigger the hate crime. What triggers it is taking it a step further and being able to prove that because of that bias that was a motivation or part of a motivation to carry out the crime. ... This is where it becomes sticky.

Witnesses said Christian hurled anti-Muslim insults at two young women on a MAX train at the Hollywood Station Friday before they said he attacked three men who defended them.

One of the young women appeared to wear a Muslim hijab, according to officers.

Portland police characterized Christians remarks as hate speech.

The FBI said its also looking into whether Christian may face domestic terrorism charges.

Terrorism charges would be a separate offense with separate elements of proof, Vecchi said, not an add-on like the hate crime.",1

"Gino Flinn is show in an undated photo sent by UNLV Police Services in a Feb. 24, 2018, message.

A man wanted for a battery and hate crime at the Student Union on the UNLV campus has been arrested.

Gino Flinn was apprehended by officers from the Las Veags Metropolitan Police Department early Tuesday.

UNLV Police Services was contacted and asked LVMPD to arrest Flinn on felony battery with a hate crime enhancement charges, according to a Tweet.

Flinn is the individual identified as being responsible for the battery and hate crime related to the campus-wide warning issued Feb. 24, according to the UNLV statement.

About 11 a.m. Friday, a UNLV student was the victim of a battery in the Student Union.

The incident was identified as a hate crime due to the suspects use of homophobic slurs directed toward the victim during the commission of the crime, UNLV stated.

The suspect, a homeless man is known to both the victim and Police Services, fled the Student Union after fellow students intervened and stopped further violence.

"The 20-year-old Newport Beach, man accused of killing a former high school classmate is an avowed Neo-Nazi and trained with a notorious extremist group committed to violent overthrow of the U.S. government, according to a newly published report.

Samuel Woodward is charged with murder in the killing 19-year-old Blaze Bernstein, a University of Pennsylvania student who went missing this month while visiting his family in Orange County. Prosecutors say Woodward stabbed Bernstein 20 times and then buried his body in a Lake Forest park, where it was found days later.

Bernstein was Jewish and gay, and police are investigating his killing as a possible hate crime.

Woodward is scheduled to be arraigned in Orange County Superior Court Friday.

Relying on “three people with detailed knowledge of Woodward’s recent past,” the investigative news website ProPublica said Woodward was a member of the group Atomwaffen – which has been tied to other killings and a bomb plot in recent months – and traveled to Texas to attend the group’s three-day training camp.

Group members at the camp were trained in firearms and hand-to-hand combat, a former Atomwaffen member told ProPublica. The individual, who watched Woodward shoot at the camp, described him as skilled in handling handguns and assault rifles. ProPublica said it obtained photos of Woodward and other group members “making straight-armed Nazi salutes while wearing skull masks.”

Atomwaffen’s commitment to violence makes it more dangerous than other groups that have emerged from the recent wave of white supremacists, according to experts on right-wing extremism quoted by the news site. And unlike other new white nationalist groups, Atomwaffen embraces Nazi imagery and openly celebrates Adolf Hitler and Charles Manson.

The group was estimated to have about 80 members, but its ranks have grown since the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Va., last year, the former member told ProPublica.",1
"Prosecutors say a homeless man faces burglary and hate crime charges after he allegedly robbed four churches, one of which he stole from three times, in Queens, because of his hatred of God. Rana Novini reports.

A homeless man faces burglary and hate crime charges after he allegedly robbed four churches, one of which he stole from three times, in Queens, New York, because of his hatred of God, according to prosecutors.

Woznik allegedly told police at the time of his arrest he was mad at God and denounced religion, saying his break-ins were an attempt to retaliate.

Im mad at God. I dont like church no more. I dont want to deal with religion, court documents say he told police. Im sick and tired of hearing about religion. I dont break into houses, only churches. I break in to get back at God.

Joseph Woznik was arrested Wednesday, Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said Thursday.

Between March 21 and April 10, Woznik allegedly broke into the Bangladesh Hindu Maunder Temple in Flushing, Blessed Virgin Mary Help of Christians church in Woodside, St. Marys Romanian Orthodox Church in Elmhurst and St. James Episcopal Church in Flushing, according to criminal complaints.

An employee at the Hindu temple found cash missing from three donation boxes forced open on March 21, prosecutors said. Fingerprints lifted from the boxed allegedly matched Wozniks.

Woznik allegedly burglarized St. James Episcopal Church three times between March 24 and April 10, according to prosecutors. He allegedly stole a Canon digital camera, $1,800 in cash and three checks; two of those items were recovered from his backpack at the time of his arrest, investigators said.

With it being Holy Week, religious leaders said theyre not angry, but they do hope he gets help.

I would tell him that he should find God first and see that God is not a reason to do something bad or damaging, said Justin Bertea of St. Marys Romanian Orthodox Church.

Maybe for us as a religious organization, we havent lived up to what we need to do, said Rev. Paul Lai of St. James Episcopal Church. So thats why someone who was in a crisis didnt get the help.

The 23-year-old could face up to 15 years in prison if hes convicted.

Woznik is also wanted by Orange County officials in Florida on a fugitive from justice charge. He is accused of burglary, grand theft and criminal mischief, according to prosecutors.",1
"- Central Market, a Nepali-Indian grocery store on Albemarle Road in East Charlotte, reopened Friday after being closed for more than a month following an arson and vandalism that police labeled a hate crime last month.

On April 6, police say the front door at the store was torched and a rock was thrown through the window. Investigators said it was a hate crime.

Related: Man arrested in connection to hate crime against Nepali-Indian store in east Charlotte

Police later arrested Curtis Flournoy saying he tried to burn the place down and left a note threatening to torture the owner if he didnt leave town.

“I got a bunch of letters in my mailbox, ‘Be strong. We are with you. We will help you” said store owner Kamal Dhimal.

Dhimal was a refugee from Bhutan who became a U.S. citizen.

He was determined to repair and reopen his store even though the crime made him worry about his safety and that of other immigrant businesses. Dhimal wanted to reopen in the same spot he’s been for years.

“I want to do something by standing in this building to this community. I want to help this community.”

On Friday, reopening day, the store was busy, the mood hopeful, and the message uplifting.

Durga Pradhan, Dhimal’s brother, said, “We are a very peace-loving people, so we don’t want any crimes. We don’t hate each other. We live in peace. That is what we do.”",1
"On April 5, 2017, Senators Alexander and Corker joined in the unanimous consent of the Senate and “agreed to” S.Res. 118: A resolution condemning hate crime and any other form of racism, religious or ethnic bias, discrimination, incitement to violence, or animus targeting a minority in the United States. Because S.Res.118 was introduced as a “simple resolution,” considered a non-binding statement of the Senate, no roll call vote is required, the House does not vote on it, and it has no force of law although it remains to be seen whether a bill will follow later.

According to the Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC), “[t]he drafting, introduction, and passage of this resolution [was] the result of a joint advocacy effort between MPAC and Emerge USA [a Muslim organization now renamed eMgage]. We ensured that the resolution went beyond rhetoric and resolves that the government take concrete steps to address hate crimes.”

S.Res. 118 references acts of anti-Semitism, threats against Jewish institutions, anti-Black or anti-African American bias crimes, and “harassment and hate-based violence against individuals who are perceived to be Arab or Muslim, including members of South Asian communities in the United States, and Hindu and Sikh Americans” but reserves the opening and misleading statistic in the second clause for Muslims:

Whereas, in 2015, hate crimes targeting Muslims in the United States increased by 67 percent, reaching a level of violence targeting Muslim Americans that the United States had not experienced since the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation

Putting the “67 percent” increase in hate crimes targeting Muslims into the full data scope of the FBI’s hate crime reports shows an exaggerated and misleading use of the statistic. For example, going back as far as the FBI 2012 Hate Crime Statistics through the most recently published, Jewish victims of anti-religious hate crimes far out-stripped the number of Islamic/Muslim victims. In fact, the number of victims in categories such as racially-motivated and sexual-orientation motivated hate crimes also far exceeded the number of Islamic/Muslim victims:

2012: racial bias – 3,467 total victims 2013: racial bias – 3,407 total victims

66.2% anti-black bias or 2,295 victims 66.4% anti-black bias or 2,262 victims

sexual orientation bias – 1,376 total victims sexual orientation bias – 1,402 total victims

53.9% anti-gay/male or 741 victims 60.6% anti-gay/male or 849 victims

religious bias – 1,340 total victims religious bias – 1,163 total victims

62.4% anti-Jewish or 836 victims 59.2% anti-Jewish or 688 victims

11.6% anti-Islamic or 155 victims 14.2% anti-Islamic or 165 victims

sexual orientation bias – 1,248 total victims sexual orientation bias – 1,263 total victims

56.8% anti-Jewish or 647 victims 52.1% anti-Jewish or 730 victims

16.1% anti-Islamic or 183 victims 21.9% anti-Islamic or 307 victims

S.Res. 118, introduced by radical California progressive, Sen. Kamala Harris was co-sponsored by Democrat Tammy Duckworth and Republicans Marco Rubio and Susan Collins (whose home state of Maine’s legislature was blocked by the ACLU and House Democrats from passing a bill to criminalize female genital mutilation).

The day after the Senate’s action, almost identical language was introduced by Virginia Republican Barbara Comstock as House Resolution 257 and now has seventeen Democrat and five Republican co-sponsors.

While neither the Senate nor House resolutions have the force of law at this time, certain provisions of the resolutions such as establishing an interagency task force and stepped up law enforcement action to address hate crimes could subsequently make their way into binding legislation.

In 2015, a similar resolution but which only addressed Muslims as a targeted group, H.Res.569, Condemning violence, bigotry, and hateful rhetoric towards Muslims in the United States, was introduced in the House by Virginia Democrat Donald Beyer and gathered 145 co-sponsors including Democrat Steve Cohen from Memphis. No further action was taken before the Congressional session ended, effectively killing the bill.",1
"Misha, who lives in a Roma camp on the outskirts of Lviv in Ukraine, said their camp was attacked in early May by men with sticks who beat everyone, including the children

Blood-stained clothes, shoes and kids toys lie scattered in several old tents where a Roma man was murdered in an attack on a forest camp in western Ukraine last week.

More than a dozen Roma people were forced to flee the camp outside the city of Lviv after about 10 masked assailants armed with batons and knives attacked them late Saturday.

They killed one and injured four, including a child, officials said.

It was the latest in a string of brutal attacks against Ukraines 260,000-strong Roma community over recent months. But it was the first such fatal attack. The 24-year-old man died from stab wounds.

Six attacks on Roma settlements have been reported in the capital Kiev and the west of the country since April.

Those wounded in the latest assault received temporary shelter from Lviv authorities. They refused to speak to journalists.

But with the help of a priest who takes care of the local Roma community, AFP reporters reached another camp hidden in the forest on the other side of the city.

Misha, 34, a member of one of four large families that live here, said that their camp too came under attack in early May.

First they hurled stones. Then they attacked with sticks. They beat everyone, even children, the dark-haired lean man said.

They burned our camp. The children hid like mice in the bushes, said Klara, a 39-year-old mother of eight, with tears in her eyes as she breastfed a child.

Residents of her 10-tent camp repeatedly shift location to avoid possible assaults.

We are very afraid of new attacks. We do not know if we can stay here, she said.

- Far-right groups -

Roma people struggled to explain the increase in attacks but police and rights campaigners pointed to far-right groups.

We are accused of stealing. But we do not steal anything. We expel from the camp those who steal, another Roma woman also named Klara, 55, told AFP.

Why do the police not catch those who steal?

Following the deadly attack, police detained eight suspects: seven attackers aged 16 and 17 and their 20-year-old alleged organiser.

It said the suspects were members of a radical group called Sober and Angry Youth. It has ties to the Azov battalion, a former volunteer force that fought against Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.

Members of the organisation did not respond to a request for an interview made by AFP via social networks.

A YouTube channel operated by the group was deleted shortly after last weeks attack. The channel is called Lemberg Jugend (Lviv Youth in German), an apparent reference to the Nazi-era Hitler Youth.

Members of the group also used in their videos symbols of the far-right Misanthropic Division, a neo-Nazi group that was reportedly launched by radical Ukrainian football fans.

The organisation posted Nazi-themed slogans and pictures on its channel on the Telegram messenger service, where it has just a few dozen subscribers.

- Authorities negligent? -

In Kiev, AFP spoke to the leader of another far-right group, C14. It was accused of attacking a Roma camp in a park in the capital in April.

A YouTube video showed the group threw stones and sprayed gas at the Roma before burning their abandoned tents.

The groups leader Yevgen Karas said it acted in reaction to a violation of the law.

He accused the Roma of causing bonfires and deforestation and of robbing local residents.

Police said they were placing all Roma camps in Ukraine under protection following the latest deadly attack.

Rights campaigners accused authorities of negligence, saying this made the attackers feel they could get away with it.

If from the very beginning it had been a tough reaction and all those responsible had been brought to justice... then this would have become a very serious sign for radical groups, Zola Kondur, a vice-president of the Kiev-based Roma fund Chirikli, told AFP.

When attackers see that no one is held responsible, then they continue such actions.

Kondur urged the authorities to develop a program to help Roma find employment, improve their living conditions and facilitate access to education for their children.

We lack mutual understanding and a friendly attitude to... different national minorities and people of different ethnic origins, she said.

James Gonzalo Medina pleaded guilty today to a federal hate crime for attempting to attack an Aventura, Florida synagogue, and to a charge of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction.

During the plea proceedings, Medina admitted that in March and April 2016, he planned to conduct a firearms or explosives attack on the Aventura Turnberry Jewish Center. Medina took steps to prepare for this attack including conducting surveillance of the Jewish Center. On April 29, 2016, Medina took possession of what he believed to be an explosive device, obtained from a Southern Florida Joint Terrorism Task Force agent, and approached the Jewish Center on foot with the device in hand, intending to commit the attack.

“Acts of bigotry and hatred are evil and have no place in our society,” Attorney General Sessions said. “One of the top priorities of this Department of Justice is reducing violent crime, and you can be sure that this includes hate crime. We will not tolerate this repugnant lawlessness, and we will be vigilant in prosecuting hate crime offenders to the fullest extent of the law. I want to thank the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Southern Florida Joint Terrorism Task Force, and all of the Department of Justice attorneys and staff who worked to bring this criminal to justice, and I assure every American that the Department of Justice is committed to protecting their rights.”

A sentencing hearing has not yet been set.

"With so little being known about what motivated Stephen Paddock to open fire on a crowd attending a concert last weekend in Las Vegas, killing more than 50 people and injuring hundreds, right-wing activists and commentators are grasping at anything they can find in an effort to paint Paddock as an Islamic extremist or a left-wing radical.

In a video posted yesterday, right-wing commentator Josh Bernstein went so far as to suggest that the ex-husband of Paddock’s girlfriend may have been ultimately responsible for the attack and should be monitored by authorities because his social media pages are “littered with anti-Trump and pro-leftist progressive garbage.”

Admitting that there was nothing in the social media accounts of Paddock, his brother, his ex-wives, or his girlfriend, Marilou Danley, that provided any clues about a possible motive or political views, Bernstein decided to focus on the accounts of Danley’s ex-husband.

“Now, this guy could have been the shooter,” Bernstein said. “This is the guy that fit that profile, absolutely fit that profile and, to be honest with you, after looking at his Facebook page, this guy should be monitored for hate crimes. He should be monitored and investigated for having any ties to Antifa or any other terrorist or communist groups.”

“This guy is a radical and I wonder if he had anything to do with this,” Bernstein continued. “Was he such an influence on his ex-wife Marilou that she—maybe she didn’t show it on social media—but maybe she was also a radicalized person and she met this guy, Stephen Paddock, and maybe she radicalized him.”",1

"On November 14, just a few days after Donald Trumps election, Chuck Redding was driving home in Sarasota in a car with marriage equality and pride bumper stickers. Suddenly, Redding noticed a man in a Jeep Cherokee tailing him. Once Redding parked in the driveway, the bearded man jumped out, banged on Reddings window, and yanked the door open.

“You know my new president says we can kill all you faggots now!” the man yelled as he dragged the 75-year-old from his car and pummeled him.

Left badly bruised and with a hand swollen to twice its size, Redding called police to report the alleged hate crime. Reddings case is one of many reported across the country after Donald Trump’s election, as New Times detailed last week in a feature story produced with data from ProPublica.

Now, Reddings tale is one of dozens told in a new documentary, Trumphobia, which follows the first six months of Trump’s presidency and the national spike in hate crimes that followed. Director Carolina Sosa and her team hope to examine the effects Trumps rhetoric has had on his supporters and opponents.

But Sosa says her film isnt meant to demonize Trump voters — in fact, the point of the film is to create a space to understand the fear voters on both sides experienced leading up to and after the election. Sosa says as she traveled the U.S. filming the documentary, including a stop in Miami, she asked people on the street about the election results. Even in South Florida, she found a common theme among Trump supporters she interviewed: Most were unwilling to speak on-camera about why they had voted for him.

“We saw that there was some sort of fear from them to express their opinion because theyre afraid of being judged,” Sosa says.

In Reddings case, hes certain a fear of gay people drove his attacker. The Sarasota County police department confirmed the attack in a police report but so far have not made any arrests.

Redding has been left with a hand so weak that he cant even open a bottle of soda and a wary tendency to keep an eye on his rearview mirror for cars that come too close. But Redding says hes not been cowed by the violence.

“People said, ‘Well, I imagine you took off the sticker,” Redding says. “As a matter of fact, I got a bigger one.”

Redding says he believes Trump has brought out the worst in Americans by exploiting divisions and encouraging violence at his rallies. He says hes seen it in his own family: His daughter, who had previously told him she didnt support his sexuality, stopped talking to him after the election.

In his interview for the documentary, Redding says he wishes he could ask his attacker just one question: “What did I ever do to you?”

This weekend, Redding says, he’ll attend his first-ever Pride parade in St. Petersburg, and he’ll be keeping in mind what his partner of 21 years used to tell him: Dont be stupid; be who you are. If they like you, they like you. If they dont, they dont. Its as simple as that.”

Sosa and her team plan to begin editing footage for their film, which they hope to release by this fall. They’ve started a crowdfunding campaign to fund the rest of their travel, editing, and production. In the end, Sosa says, she hopes the film can heal some of the division in the country by promoting a message of empathy.

Sosa thinks the best solution to the chaos that has devolved in protests across the nation is to really listen to the other persons opinions and try to understand why they think that way and work together for a negotiation of what both sides want, she says. Otherwise, its only going to be friction.

"WEST HARTFORD, Conn. -- A former University of Hartford student could be facing hate crime charges after she was arrested this weekend in connection with accusations that she put bodily fluids on her roommates possessions, according to NBC Connecticut.

Brianna Brochu, 18, was arrested on Saturday and charged with third-degree criminal mischief and second-degree breach of peace, but police are now asking the court to add a charge of intimidation based on bigotry or bias, NBC Connecticut reported. University of Hartford President Greg Woodward said in a statement that Brochu is no longer a student at the school and will not be returning.

Brochu is accused of tampering with her former roommates possessions by spitting in her coconut oil and putting moldy clam dip in her lotion, as well as putting used tampons in her backpack and sticking the roommates toothbrush where the sun dont shine, according to NBC Connecticut. The roommate told police and shared on Facebook that Brochu had posted pictures of the incidents on Instagram, according to NBC Connecticut.

The roommate also told police that she suffered from severe throat pain, which she suspected may have been a result of Brochus actions, NBC Connecticut reported.

In his statement, Woodward said that the incident has brought about accusations of racism, and said I want you to know that I hear and share your anger and frustration. Acts of racism, bias, bullying, or other abusive behaviors will not be tolerated on this campus. I pledge to do everything in my power to work with our community to address related concerns together.

In one of her Instagram posts after the roommate moved out, Brochu celebrated getting rid of Jamaican Barbie, according to the Hartford Courant. Brochu told police that her roommate was rude and created a hostile environment, and posted Snapchat videos of her sleeping, the Hartford Courant reported.

In a brief appearance in court on Wednesday, Brochu was ordered to stay away from the University of Hartford and to not have contact with the roommate, according to the Hartford Courant.

Woodward said in a statement that he has met with students, including representatives from the Student Government Association and multicultural organizations, as well as with the roommate and her family.

We will continue to offer support and assistance to her, as well as any other student that feels threatened, victimized, or uncomfortable on our campus. Let me repeat; racism and hatred will not be tolerated on this campus, Woodward said.

"“When faced with such crimes of hate and inhumanity, it is the responsibility of every person of conscience to speak out — to oppose this campaign of violence before it continues further.”

–Former Vice President Joe Biden, in a statement released on Friday condemning the abduction, torture and murder of gay men in Chechnya.

Gay men are reported to have been assaulted, blackmailed, even held in concentration camp-style prisons in a state-sanctioned purge, with as many as 100 men arrested for homosexuality.

Biden said he was “disgusted and appalled” at the situation in Chechnya.

“Every man or woman on this earth is entitled to be treated with dignity—to live without fear and to love freely,” he said. “Unfortunately, the human rights abuses perpetrated by Chechen authorities and the culture of impunity that surrounds them means that these hate crimes are unlikely to ever be properly investigated or that the perpetrators will see justice. But that does not mean that we should fail to defend basic human rights, fundamental freedoms, and universal values.”

Biden implored the Trump administration to raise the crisis in Chechnya with Russian leaders, saying: “The United States must lead the way to demand an end to these egregious violations of human rights.”

Amnesty International this week launched a petition demanding an end to the crisis in Chechnya, condemning the Chechen authorities for their apparent complicity in the attacks on LGBTQ people and urging “immediate action to ensure [LGBTQ people’s] safety.”

Ellen DeGeneres and other celebrities have taken to Twitter to inform their followers of what’s happening in Chechnya, with DeGeneres tweeting that the world needed to “rise up” and help tortured gay men in the region.",1
"BEL AIR, MD — Three men who appeared intoxicated are wanted in connection with a recent assault at the Bel Air Wawa.

When they arrived at the store, officials said the men got into a verbal altercation with the victim that escalated, and they began physically assaulting him. After a store employee confronted them, the men left the scene, according to the sheriffs office. The suspects were described as three white men with short brown hair and beards, one of whom had tattoos on his forearms and neck. Anyone with information is asked to call Deputy First Class Jenings at 410-612-1717.

"If you see a stranger shouting religious or racial epithets at someone, this is how you can intervene and help the victim.

Hate crimes have been on a frightening rise in the United States ever since President Donald Trump’s election. People, particularly those who belong to minority communities, fear if they or one of their family members will become the next target of violence simply because of the color of their skin, their gender or sexual orientation, the religion they follow, their national origin, and even their disability.

Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric seems to have emboldened bigots and white supremacists all across the country. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, some 900 incidents of hate or bias were recorded in the first ten days after the November election. The number jumped to 1,094 in the first month.

Sadly, most incidents of racial or religious harassment go unreported. Sometimes, even when such incidents are reported to the concerned authorities, the attackers are not charged with hate crimes.

For instance, a 17-year-old Muslim girl in Virginia, Nabra Hassanen, was walking with her friends back to her mosque after breakfast before sunrise when a 22-year-old man, identified as Darwin Martinez Torres, allegedly shouted slurs at them. Feeling threatened, the girls ran towards the safety of the All Dulles Area Muslim Society, but realized they had left Hassanen behind.

The police later found the girl’s remains in a pond. She was reportedly sexually assaulted and police believed she was beaten with a bat. Torres was arrested and charged with murder. However, he was not charged with a hate crime and the authorities classified the incident as a road rage.

Perhaps to understand the phenomenon better, one should start with the basic question: what makes a crime a hate crime?

“A crime is designated as a hate crime if law enforcement can prove that the primary motivation for the commission of the crime was based on hate or bias against an individual because of one of their protected identity characteristics,” Lecia Brooks, the outreach director at Southern Poverty Law Center told Carbonated.TV. “Identity characteristics: like race or nationality, immigration status, sexual orientation.”

Matthew W. Doherty, a former Secret Service agent and the senior vice president of Chicago-based strategic security and corporate investigations consulting firm, Hillard Heintze, also clarified the difference between hate speech and free speech and when it should be reported to the authorities.

“Hate crimes are not tolerated in the United States, nor is hateful language,” he explained. “Now, there is a constitutionally protected right of free speech, but if you feel bodily harm, then that should be reported to authorities or management if you’re in a particular workplace environment.”

It’s easy to lose hope in the face of what’s happening in the country. But, if you see a stranger shouting religious or racial slurs at someone, there are ways to intervene and help the victim.

1. Distract the perpetrator

The first step would be to distract the perpetrator, but that doesn’t mean you should interact with them. Instead, focus on the person being targeted. Call them or wave at them to let the bigot know the victim has friends or allies in the area.

2. Talk to the target

Engage the victim in a conversation. Start talking about weather, the traffic, the new billboard across the street, anything really to take their attention off the attacker. Make the perpetrator feel they are being ignored. That is often enough for them to back down.

Stay with the target until the attacker is gone. If you are someplace secluded, perhaps walk the person to their home or a crowded area where they can’t be ambushed.

3. Find someone in authority

The final and perhaps the most important step would be to contact the authorities – and that doesn’t necessarily mean police.

“If you’re in a store, that could be a store manager or a supervisor. If you’re in school, that could be an administrator, campus police on college campus, something like that,” said Brooks.

In the aftermath of the tragedy in Portland, where a white supremacist fatally stabbed two heroic men and injured the third after they tried to intervene and stop him from harassing two young women who appeared to be Muslim, there is a new fear in the air. While those men died as heroes taking a stand against hate in Trump’s America, the incident also served as a reminder that these bigots could also cause physical harm.

In this case, the attacker was armed with a knife and had violent intent.

“I think it depends on the physicality of the bystander,” Doherty continued. “If they are confident in themselves and have appropriate physicality to perhaps interject then I would say yes, and if not, it might escalate the situation.”

Helping someone in distress might be a gut instinct for many, but one should also keep their own safety in mind.

“The first thing you want do is look to your own personal safety, right?” Brooks added. “You want to look around, determine whether or not you’re safe, if there are any other people around you and make sure that you are safe first.”

"An Indian American landlord in Milford, Connecticut become a victim of a hate crime during a building inspection when a man yelled at the officials who were inspecting the area on Feb. 13, according to The Milford Daily News.

“Burn the building down,” “Shoot that guy right there” and “These people are pigs, deport them all, where is I.C.E.?” the man said multiple times during the two-hour inspection, pointing to the Jagdish Patel, who has been living in Milford since 1989.

“I became deeply disturbed and uncomfortable as did other members of the team who were there just to carry out simple code inspections. What occurred during this process I believe to be unethical, immoral, racist, aggressive, intimidating and in violation of laws against discrimination, and in violation of the civil rights of the landlord and residents of the building,” Milford Police Administrative Supervisor Sgt. James Heron told The Milford Daily News, who refused to disclose the name of the man who made such racial comments during the inspection.

The inspection included a review of 12 apartments, common areas and the building’s exterior.

Patel said that he heard the statements but decided not to say anything because he was planning on traveling to India to visit family the next day.

Patel added that he heard the guy say that officials should give tenants a 30 days’ notice to leave the building and then burn it down.

“I’ve been here 35 years … they don’t have a right to say anything,” Patel told The Milford Daily News referring to the town officials.

Officials did end up reporting evidence of overcrowding in both the commercial areas on the first floor however, Patel claimed that some tenants had guests visiting during the time of the inspection and planned to follow up with town officials later on for more information about the inspection as well as the incident.

The Milford Daily News asked Patwel if he was going to take any legal action to which he replied “if I have to, I will because I don’t know if I go to Town Hall how they’re going to treat me.”",1

"In his first inaugural address, delivered to a divided nation in a capital city riven with turmoil, President Abraham Lincoln invoked, “the mythic chords of our memory … being touched yet again by the better angels of our nature.” More than 150 years later to a divided nation and tumultuous capital, the deceptively named group, ACT for America, has invited Americans across the land to March Against Sharia, stirring up the worst demons of our nature. The Islamophobia, xenophobia, and the sheer hate mongering of this call must not stand unchallenged.

As proud New Yorkers we embrace and celebrate the diversity of our great city. We are energized by the fact that Jews, Christians, Muslims, believers in other faiths, and non-believers live together here in a cacophony of voices that yet find harmony in the accents of New York. We love the variety of languages, cuisines, and religious beliefs that make America great.

And so we two, an African-American Protestant Minister, and a Caucasian Jewish Rabbi, join together to respond to ACT for America with the love our Abrahamic traditions teach us. We reject the call to oppose Shari’a, much as we as clergy reject any call to disrespect any ancient religious body of teachings and norms.

Shari’a is Islamic law, codes of behavior touching on Muslims’ prayer, charitable giving, professions of belief, interpersonal relations, food rules, and the like. Shari’a is a way of life for Muslims, much like halakhah, the explicated laws of the Torah, is for the Jewish community. To attack Shari’a is not only a display of mean-spirited ignorance, it is also an invitation to attack Jewish law or the Christian way. ACT and anti-Muslim fear-mongering groups like it, run roughshod over First Amendment constitutional protections to freedom of worship and association.

ACT for America correctly has been labeled as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Their pronouncements against Islam as somehow un-American ignore the fact that Islam was on this continent even before the United States existed. Like Christianity and Judaism, Islam holds a proud place in the great fabric of America.

Deriding Muslims as alien shows profound disrespect for our neighbors. The diminishment of people of color must be called out as racism and xenophobia. We as Christians and Jews instead have been raised to “love our neighbor as ourselves.” We are commanded by the Bible to “know the stranger for you were once strangers.” We are taught that we have been made as different peoples, different genders and races, “that we might know one another” all as God’s children. If we strive with one another, we must strive to do good deeds of love and kindness.

As proud Americans we fervently believe in the free exercise of religion ― indeed, all religions. To attack Islam is to attack Americans of all religious backgrounds. Let us begin with tolerance and then grow to respect and understanding. To know another religion is to also learn the borders and limits of our own. We are blessed when we learn how others experience God.

It is now the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. During this month, our Muslim neighbors fast each day, reflect on their relationship with God, and their place in the community. Muslims give charity during this period and reach out to the hungry and the needy.

Instead of “Marching Against Sharia,” we humbly suggest that our fellow Americans learn from our Muslim neighbors. Let us spend this month getting right with God and meditating on the words of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., “I never intend to become adjusted to religious bigotry.” Mutual respect and tolerance for one another has become the very essence of who we are as Americans. We are at our best when we break bread with one another. Now more than ever, it is the time to do what the Good Book teaches and “love one another.”

While some in our nation attempt to divide us with fear tactics, we trust New Yorkers will stand up for our shared values.",1
"Three New Hampshire juveniles could face hate crime charges after an an alleged assault on the Boston musician known as Keytar Bear.

Keytar Bear is a well-known street musician who dresses in a bear costume and plays music in various places across Boston.



Boston police responded to a call Saturday at 4:40 p.m. in the area of Congress and State streets downtown for an assault and battery in progress.

A responding officer saw the well-known Keytar Bear surrounded by a group of young men in what appeared to be a fight.

Photo credit: @BostonTweet

When the officer approached with the lights and sirens activated on his cruiser, the young men fled on foot.

Witnesses were able to point the officer in the direction of the suspects, observing the young men climbing up the scaffolding of a building and laying down on a platform in an attempt to hide.

When the officer ordered the suspects to come down, they complied.

Following an investigation, police learned that Keytar Bear had been attacked by the suspects while he was playing music near Faneuil Hall.

The suspects allegedly ripped off Keytar Bear’s mask before striking him several times in the face and body while using racial slurs.

Police said when witnesses attempted to intervene, the suspects also hurled racial slurs at them before fleeing.

Jessica Baldwin, of Nashville, Tennessee, was in town for Sail Boston with her 10-year-old son, Thompson Fine, when they witnessed the attack.

Right after I took the picture of the guy with his arm around Keytar Bear, he slammed his face down into the ground, took his bear head off, Baldin recalled. I didnt see the punching, but you could hear the screaming.

Police said the suspects damaged Keytar Bears equipment in the attack. The man sustained a facial laceration and swelling to the right eye.

He later said he felt it was a hate crime. That it was racially driven, Baldwin said.

When the suspects allegedly stole Keytar Bears tips, thats when Baldwins son stepped up to the plate.

I gave him $4, Fine recalled. And I got a sticker badge.

Since news of the attack broke, there have been numerous online messages to the anonymous bear. A GoFundMe account set up to help him purchase new equipment raised $4,800 as of Monday afternoon.

I am heartbroken about what happened. We love you and what you give to Boston and we all have your back. You are a treasure, one fan wrote.



Saturdays attack was the fourth on Keytar Bear over the years.



The three juvenile suspects — a 15-year-old from Londonderry, a 16-year-old from Salem and a 17-year-old from Manchester — were arrested and charged with assault and battery and disorderly conduct. The 16-year-old was also charged with possession of alcohol by a minor.

Prosecutors said they are also reviewing the case for potential hate crime charges.

The three teens were arraigned on Monday and released into their parents custody with orders to stay away from the victim, witnesses and Faneuil Hall.",1
"PALATINE, IL – A late November seat belt enforcement campaign in Palatine turned into more than seat belt laws being enforced.

It has been almost 20 years since the brutal murder of gay student Matthew Shepard in Laramie, Wyoming. Shortly after Shepard’s death, the Tectonic Theater Company interviewed residents of Laramie to examine the American psyche within the community.

From these interviews and another series of interviews 10 years later, the Company created the poignant two-in-one play, “The Laramie Project Cycle.”

Walking into the black box performance space at the Access Theater, audience members almost feel as if the play has already begun. Matthew Shepard lays slumped on the floor, his hands tied to the bottom of a fence. This initial scene is striking, and the audience’s discomfort is foretelling of the difficult story ahead.

“The Laramie Project Cycle” almost exclusively consists of interviews, bringing audiences to the epicenter of the tight-knit community in Wyoming. In addition to our silent protagonist, Matthew Shepard — an artistic choice by Director Natalie Zito — there are 10 actors who weave in and out of 60 roles.

While their rapidly-changing identities can sometimes confuse the audience, the actors’ commitment to these voices makes for extremely convincing personas.

However, the director’s artistic choice of Shepard’s physical presence and contemporary dance-like movements feel very distracting. The physicality of his character seems unnecessary since his spirit is felt throughout the memories and conversations read about him.

“The Laramie Project Cycle” is very relevant to today’s societal and media dilemmas. The play’s wide spectrum of opinions shows how the country was and still is oblivious to the vast magnitude of hate present today.

The “Ten Years Later” section of the play asks for remembrance and honesty. In an attempt to recover, the city of Laramie has tried to forget about Matthew Shepard, removing lingering aspects of his life. Because the crime in the community’s vernacular and media obfuscation was erased, some people even deny that the murder was a hate crime.

One of the most significant messages imparted by the project is how all of the characters involved were products of society. The hatred or love they felt was rooted in culture, and communities require dialogue in order to understand and eradicate that hate. The portrayal of universities as a safe bubble within Laramie will especially resonate with students.

Despite audible interruptions from the dance studio above the theater, “The Laramie Project Cycle” is worth seeing. While lengthy — clocking in at almost five hours — the play’s two parts — original interviews and 10 years later — can be experienced on separate days, which is highly recommended.

The Wandering Theatre Company’s “The Laramie Project Cycle” is running at the Access Theater through March 4. Tickets can be purchased here.

"LAKEWOOD, NJ — Christy and CJ Keronen were as close as siblings can be, getting through the challenges that life has presented them, as a team. When their mother, Corrine, died nine years ago, they pulled together to help their family, including their father, get through the devastating loss of their matriarch, the backbone of our family, CJ Keronen said. When Christy started talking about starting her own cleaning business and asked CJ to help her, he agreed. They listened to each others problems, and helped each other in myriad ways. Christy and I have lived together virtually our whole lives, CJ Keronen said in an email Thursday afternoon. And now for the first time, Im helpless to save her. Thats because his 29-year-old sister was found dead Wednesday, less than a day after she went missing, in the Jackson Township home of a man whom shed known for about a year. The lifeless body of that man, Tyree Johnson, 32, was found hanging from the bucket of a Comcast truck parked in the parking lot of a group of offices on South Holmdel Road in Holmdel Township earlier Wednesday, according to Al Della Fave, spokesman for the Ocean County Prosecutors Office. Christy Keronens body was found in Johnsons home on Lexington Court when police from Holmdel and Jackson went to make family notification of Johnsons death, Della Fave said. She had suffered head trauma, Della Fave said. Authorities are investigating it as a murder-suicide, Della Fave said Thursday. Read more: Police Release Details Of Murder-Suicide In Holmdel And Jackson I lost my sister, my best friend, CJ Keronen said in a post on Facebook on Thursday. Words cant even explain what Im feeling right now. By email, CJ said his sister was the kind of person who helped anyone and everyone. She did things out of the kindness of her heart and was never about receiving any kind of recognition to do so, he said, adding that there was no one story that summed up her kindness. Countless times Ive seen her give money to the homeless hanging outside our local Wawa, lending money to friends whenever they needed, even if she was short on funds herself, said CJ, who is six years older than Christy. Mostly though she was great at listening to other peoples problems and helping them through their situation. Whether it was relationship advice, finding work, anything that was ever asked of her, she felt compelled to do what should could. She also knew what she wanted and didnt want, CJ said. Christy had been talking to me about starting her own cleaning company, he said. His sister, a 2005 graduate of Howell High School, had earned a medical assistant certification from Star Career Academy, but had been working with CJ cleaning offices more recently. Shes been cleaning up around the offices from where we work as was her job, and really wanted to start something for herself, he said. Shed started creating lists of supplies she might need, searched for rates, everything that she felt she would need to get started. She even asked me to help her run the scheduling and financial side, which I obviously agreed that I would. Her plan for the business was simply an extension of the team they had already become; CJ said that after their mother died, Christy and I were responsible for keeping us all together. With my dad getting older, now 70, it has been up to us to keep things running, CJ said. Working, cooking, cleaning. Making sure our bills and rent get paid. It all fell on us, but as a team, we made it work. CJ said he did not know much about his sisters relationship with Johnson, beyond that they had known each other for more than a year and had a few mutual friends. But his sister, who did not appear to have a boyfriend from her Facebook profile, had been clear that she only viewed Johnson as a friend, CJ said. I often times would overhear her venting to friends about how shes not looking for a relationship right now, and how Tyree needs to understand this or they can no longer be friends, CJ said. The last conversation he had with his sister was mundane. The siblings had the day off from work due to Rosh Hashanah, and she left the house to run some errands. The last conversation I had with her was just to ask her what she had planned for the day, CJ said. She mentioned that she still needed to look for a dress for a wedding we were supposed to go to this Friday. I thought nothing of it really, when I came downstairs a few hours later, she had already left. When she had not come home Tuesday night, and missed work Wednesday without calling to let anyone know, CJ began searching for her, and filed a missing persons report with Lakewood police. It was just hours later that authorities notified him that Christy had been found dead, according to both CJ and Della Fave. The hardest thing I ever had to do in my life was to explain to my father that his baby girl is dead, CJ said in the Facebook post where he told friends his sister was found dead. Friends responding to his post remarked with comments about Christys kindness and warmth. Your sister was an amazing person and I was so lucky to have experienced that, Brittany Alfaro said. Christy will always be remembered for her big heart & great laugh!! Destinie Brannigan wrote. She was always the warmest & sweetest person. My heart hurts for you & your Dad & I am so sorry. May she rest in peace. Im doing my best to hold it together while still trying to get the word out on how wonderful a person she was, CJ said by email. She deserved so much more out of life ... And now for the first time, Im helpless to save her. I love you Christy Keronen ... May you forever rest in peace, CJ Keronen said in his Facebook post.

"The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) is calling for hate crime charges for a man accused of throwing a pigs foot at a Somali man in Willmar.

Willmar police say the incident happened at a local farmers market on Saturday at about 11 a.m. They say a 61-year-old man approached a booth run by a local Somali man and reportedly threw a pigs foot on the table and swore at the man.

Police say the man left, but several witnesses were able to provide photos of him. Willmar police were able to identify him and issued a citation for disorderly conduct, which requires a court appearance.

Disorderly conduct is a misdemeanor, but if an officer does not witness it, it is not an arrestable offense, according to Willmar police.

CAIR responded to the incident in a press release on Tuesday, asking that hate crime charges be brought against the man. They claim he shouted anti-Muslim slurs before throwing the pigs foot at a group of Muslims.

Because Muslims are prohibited from consuming pork products, CAIR said pigs feet are often used to offend.

If you curse a persons faith and then throw an object clearly designed to offend and intimidate, you should be charged with a hate crime, said CAIR-MN Civil Rights Director Amir Malik in the press release.

The case has been forwarded to the courts and a court date is pending, according to police.

According to CAIRs press release, the organization has seen a spike in hate incidents targeting Muslims and other minority groups since the Nov. 8 election. The number of hate crimes tracked by CAIR in the first half of 2017 spiked 91 percent compared to the same period in 2016, according to the organization.",1

"FBI released a new report on hate crimes in the U.S. and it shows Massachusetts had the highest rate of reported hate crimes in the country last year.

Massachusetts had the highest rate of reported hate crimes in the country last year, according to a new FBI report. There were 5.9 hate crime incidents for every 100,000 people in 2016, giving it the highest rate of reported hate crimes in the U.S. per capita.

The report shows more than half of the crimes statewide were based on race. More than 70 incidents were based on sexual orientation. And about a quarter were religion-based.

John Robbins, Executive Director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Massachusetts, says they have seen a huge increase in hate crimes in the last year alone.

Here in Massachusetts, we’ve documented over 200 requests for help around incidents ranging from employment discrimination, at schools, bullying or issues at the airports specifically targeting the Muslim American community, he explained.

Robert Trestan with the Anti-Defamation League in New England says change starts at the top.

“It’s critical that we put a stop to the amount of hate and bigotry and name calling that’s happening at the highest levels.”

Trestam added, while Massachusetts has a long way to go, action is being taken.

“Governor Baker is taking a national lead in bringing people together to talk about these exact issues.”

"The 23-year-old white supremacist who stabbed a black Bowie State University student to death has been indicted for a hate crime, Prince George County State Attorney Angela Alsobrooks announced Tuesday (Oct. 17). Sean Urbanski, a former University of Maryland student, killed Lt. Richard W. Collins “because of his race,” Alsobrooks said.

READ: FBI Probing Murder Of Bowie University Student Is A Possible Hate Crime

Urbanski belonged to a white supremacist Facebook group called Alt-Reight: Nation; was a Donald Trump supporter; and made various racist comments online in addition to liking racist memes and posts.

He initially dodged hate crime charges in July due to lack of evidence, but in the months since, prosecutors collected “lots and lots of digital evidence” to warrant the indictment returned by a grand jury.

“We are comfortable at this point that the motive in this case was race, and that’s what’s required [for a hate crime charge],” said Alsobrooks, who is seeking life without parole for Urbanski, according to the Capital Gazette. “What we are saying is that Lt. Collins was killed because of his race.”

Collins, 23, was waiting for an Uber on the UMC campus when he encountered Urbanski, who threatened him before stabbing him in the chest. The two did not know each other.

"Washington D.C. [USA], Mar. 5(ANI): What comes as an apparent third hate crime case in two weeks against the Indian community in United States, a 39 year old Sikh man was injured by an unknown assailant, who shot the victim outside his home and allegedly shouted go back to your own country.

According to Washington Post, the victim was working on his vehicle outside his home in the city of Kent on Friday when he was approached by a stranger, who walked up to the driveway.

There was an altercation, and the gunman - a stocky, 6-foot-tall white man wearing a mask over the bottom part of his face - said Go back to your own country and pulled the trigger.

An argument ensued, and the suspect, wearing a mask, told him to go back to his homeland, the victim said. The victim told police the man then shot him in the arm.

According to the local police, the Sikh man sustained non life-threatening injuries and they are treating this as a very serious incident.

Kent police have launched an investigation into the case and reached out to the FBI and other law enforcement agencies.

In a developing story, a painted image of the crucifixion was left outside a mosque in New York and is now being investigated as a hate crime.

The painting had no inscription or writing attached to it, but was simply an image of Jesus dying on the cross.

An employee of the Hillside Islamic Center in North Hyde Park, New York, discovered the painting hanging on a fence on Friday and called police.

RENO, Nev. – The family of a 22-year-old who was brutally beaten at an Amtrak train station in California claims he was attacked because he’s gay, according to KTXL.

Tuesday, Aaron Salazar remained in a coma at Renown Hospital in Reno a week after he was brutally beaten. He has a damaged brain stem and a broken pelvis.

It broke my heart. He did not look like Aaron at all, his cousin, Sonia Trujillo, told KTXL. His face was beaten. He was swollen.

Salazar was traveling from his home in Colorado back to Oregon and made a stop in Truckee.

While he was there, he texted his great-grandmother to say he had made a friend and was heading to Sacramento, where he had a 10-hour layover. He never made it.

A station employee found Salazars battered body lying next to the train tracks. The injuries to his body have his family wondering whether it was a hate crime.

Salazar is gay. His family says he suffered devastating injuries to his groin area.

The burns on his leg were horrifying. It did not look like him at all, Trujillo said. I believe it was something deeper because the burn marks. Why burn somebody? If youre gonna hurt somebody, hurt them. But why are you gonna burn somebody?

The Amtrak and Truckee police departments did not reply to a request for comment. Salazars family says Amtrak police wont comment to them, saying it is an ongoing investigation.

I first hand saw his injuries. Theres no way that he was pushed off a train or jumped off a train because these are all upper-body injuries, Trujillo told KTXL.

Visitors to Truckee were shocked to hear about Salazars injuries.

If somebody knows something, they should step forward and help to find out exactly what happened, who caused it to happen and how we can prevent it from happening again, Truckee visitor Jim Clark said.

Meanwhile, Salazars mother keeps vigil at his bedside at the hospital. His family is keeping the faith.

Were praying, Trujillo said. Thats all we can do for him right now is pray that he pulls through this.

"The Ohio man charged with driving his car into a crowd of protesters in Charlottesville last summer has plead not guilty to 30 counts of hate crimes which led to the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuries to 19 others.

Sandy Hausman was in federal district court where Fields appeared today.

James Alex Fields waddled into the courtroom – his legs chained, his hands in cuffs, wearing a black and white striped jump suit. He said he was not guilty and asked the judge for a court appointed lawyer.

Because he could be sentenced to death, and because he has no income, the judge said he would appoint two attorneys, and he warned Fields that speaking with anyone but his lawyers about the case could bring testimony against him when his trial begins.

In response to questions about his mental health, Fields said he has been diagnosed as bi-polar, has ADHD, and suffers from depression and anxiety.

Speaking in a monotone, the 21-year-old told the judge he was on medication for all of those conditions but said he could understand the proceedings against him.

His lawyer did not request bail. He has already been charged with murder in state court and is represented by former Albemarle County Commonwealth’s Attorney Denise Lunsford.

"Rhode Island’s political and social landscape has improved since 1978 – when Dr. Jodi Glass arrived to work as an audiologist with Meeting Street School (now Meeting Street). Her professional and community contributions give voice to the voiceless. “Voice is everything,” said Glass, an accomplished initiator who builds community and praises her mentors – too numerous to name here.



Years ago, the General Assembly heard Glass, and removed gender-specific language from Rhode Island’s laws and expanded the definition of hate crimes to include sexual orientation, gender and disability.



The Clothesline Project, founded in 1990 by women artists on Cape Cod, empowers women affected by violence to express their emotions by decorating shirts and hanging them on clotheslines to promote awareness. To date, the RI Clothesline Project, which Glass founded in 1992, has more than 400 shirts. She also launched the RI Take Back the Night March, an annual march that speaks out symbolically against violence women face at home, in the workplace and on the streets, she explained. “We marched through Providence for close to 30 years; now marches take place on college and university campuses.”



For this lifelong music lover, some songs carry a political tune. Her RI Feminist Chorus sang about difficult issues – rape, incest, choice – for two decades. “It was very close to my heart,” said Glass. She founded and co-directs Grace Note Singers, a group of women who sing to individuals near death or receiving palliative care.



The longtime East Sider is a fascinating study in contrasts. Her parents had a long, loving marriage, yet she doesn’t believe in the institution of marriage for herself. “I think it’s very anti-women… built on slavery.” Nevertheless, she and her long-time partner, Ruthie, married in 2008, at the urging of Ruthie’s dying mother. Notwithstanding chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia, Glass is busy: In addition to her part-time audiology practice, she continues as the program administrator at the RI Commission on Prejudice and Bias, providing hate crime training for Rhode Island police departments. Of this work addressing hate crimes, Glass added, “It’s who I am.” In her “spare time,” this committed feminist also seeks housing for LGBT seniors and participates with RPM Voices of Rhode Island, a diverse group that sings about the authentic African-American experience.



And her message for younger generations: “It was once legal to rape your wife [up until] the early ‘80s,” she said, and Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in 1973, is challenged again and again. “Don’t have a false sense of complacency… we’re not near done.”

"? A man charged with fatally shooting an Indian immigrant last year at a suburban Kansas City bar pleaded guilty Tuesday to murder in the slaying that fanned fears of anti-immigrant violence following President Donald Trump’s election.

Witnesses said Adam Purinton, who is white, yelled “Get out of my country!” before firing at two men who had stopped for an after-work drink at Austin’s Bar and Grill in Olathe.

Srinivas Kuchibhotla was killed in the Feb. 22, 2017, attack. His friend Alok Madasani was wounded. The men, both 32, had come from India to the U.S. as students and worked as engineers at nearby GPS-maker Garmin.

Another man, Ian Grillot, was wounded when he tried to intervene.

Purinton faces life in prison with no chance of parole for 50 years when he is sentenced May 4 for premeditated first-degree murder.

At the time of the shooting, officials in India expressed concern about their citizens’ safety in the United States.

Kuchibhotla’s widow, who was not present at the hearing, issued a statement saying she hoped the guilty plea would “send a strong message that hate is never acceptable.”

“We must understand and love one another,” Sunayana Dumala said.

According to court documents, Purinton was asked to leave the bar when he made derogatory comments. He returned a short time later with a gun.

Madasani told detectives that the gunman asked the men if their “status was legal” before he opened fire, according to an affidavit released last year.

After the shooting, Purinton drove 70 miles east to Clinton, Mo., and stopped at a restaurant, where he allegedly confessed to the killings to a bartender, who called police.

Purinton, a 52-year-old Navy veteran, was a regular customer at Austin’s. Neighbors in the Olathe cul-de-sac where he lived told The Associated Press after the shooting that he became “a drunken mess” following his father’s death about two years before the shooting and had physically and mentally deteriorated.

He still faces federal hate crime charges in the slaying. Federal prosecutors have not determined whether they will seek the death penalty.",1

"Kabul Blast Kills at Least 80, Injures More Than 300: ‘Such Attacks Will Never End’

26-year-old Florida woman Jadian Sinead Zeiders has been arrested and charged with second degree murder in the beating death of a gay man last January.

Zeiders told police that she attacked 53-year-old William “Bill” Denham Jr. (above) after he walked into a back yard and masturbated in front of her.

According to the police report, Zeiders said she pointed Denham out to two other men after the incident and they struck him in self defense.

According to the Tampa Bay Times, investigators turned their attention to Zeiders three days after police found Denham lying unconscious on a sidewalk near the corner of North 15th and East Elm streets on January 14th.

An autopsy found that Denham died of blunt trauma to the face and body.

A witness told investigators he saw two men and a woman beating Denham in the street and kicking him after he fell down. The witness added that one of the attackers said something about the man being a “pedophile.”

The Tampa Bay Times reports:

Zeiders initially told police she didn’t know what happened to Denham. But later, in the same interview, she said she was outside a home on the 1500 block of Escort Avenue when a man she didn’t know entered the yard and started masturbating in front of her.

Zeiders said she hid in the laundry room of the house and when two men she knew returned there, she told them what had happened. According to Zeiders, her two acquaintances caught up with the man near 15th and Sligh Avenue and began arguing with him.

Zeiders said the man ran back to Elm Street and her companions followed. They tried to detain him, she said, and were forced to defend themselves when he attacked one of them. The man fell to the ground and her companions walked away, she said.

At that point, Zeiders told police, a black man she didn’t know came out of the bushes, kicked the man in the head and started rifling through his pockets. She said she watched as an ambulance arrived and the man walked away from the scene, refusing medical treatment.

A second witness told investigators one of the men who beat Denham lives at the Escort Avenue address, the police report says. This man told the witness the day after the beating that he and a male and female companion beat a man to death because he tried to rape Zeiders in the yard, the police report says.

Five days later, according to the same witness, the same man repeated the claim and said detectives had questioned him. A third witness told police the man bragged that he had hit someone who died.

Denham’s friends and family called the accusations absurd. His sister Maureen Tourigian said:

“He never would have attacked anyone. Anyone who knows him knows that, and that he never would expose himself to a woman. He wasn’t interested.”

Dan Kane (right), Denham’s partner of 30 years, said Zeiders fabricated a story to protect her and her accomplices. He suspects Zeiders and the two men tried to rob Denham and beat him up when they found he only had a few dollars in his pocket.

“I don’t think they need the death penalty, but they do need to be in prison for a long time to think about what they did,” he added. “They’re a danger to the community and need to be off the street.”

According to the New York Post, Zeiders faces charges of second degree murder. The two men accused alongside Zeiders are known to police but have not been charged yet.

"Property owner’s refusal to rent to same-sex couple, one of whom is transgender, violates the federal Fair Housing Act and the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act

A federal district court judge Wednesday ruled that a Boulder County property owner violated both the federal Fair Housing Act and the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act when she refused to rent a housing unit to Lambda Legal clients Rachel and Tonya Smith, a same-sex couple, one of whom is transgender, and their children, because she worried their “uniqueness” would jeopardize her standing in the community.

“This is a tremendous victory for Rachel and Tonya, their children, and LGBT people, couples, and families across the country,” Lambda Legal Staff Attorney Omar Gonzalez-Pagan said. “For the first time, a federal court has ruled that the Fair Housing Act’s sex discrimination prohibitions apply to discrimination based on stereotypes about sexual orientation and gender identity. This is two federal courts two days in a row that have said that laws prohibiting sex discrimination protect LGBT people. It sends a strong message: discrimination against LGBT Americans in housing and employment is illegal and will not be tolerated.

“The facts in this case are indisputable: Deepika Avanti refused to rent to Tonya and Rachel Smith because they are women in a same-sex relationship raising children together and Rachel is transgender,” Gonzalez-Pagan added. “Her concerns about Rachel and Tonya’s ‘uniqueness’ and ‘unique relationship’ were discrimination, pure and simple, and we are grateful that the judge agreed.”

In the court’s opinion filed Wednesday, U.S District Judge Raymond P. Moore wrote:

In this case, the Smiths contend that discrimination against women (like them) for failure to conform to stereotype norms concerning to or with whom a woman should be attracted, should marry, and/or should have children is discrimination on the basis of sex under the FHA. The Court agrees. Such stereotypical norms are no different from other stereotypes associated with women, such as the way she should dress or act (e.g., that a woman should not be overly aggressive, or should not act macho), and are products of sex stereotyping.

“We are delighted with this ruling,” Tonya Smith said. “We were so shocked and upset by Deepika’s emails, that simply because of who we are she wouldn’t rent to us. We felt it was unfair and illegal, and now a court has agreed. No one should ever have to go through what we went through, and hopefully this ruling will protect other couples like us who are trying to provide safe homes for their families.”

“While housing discrimination is a pervasive problem for LGBT people, it is very much underreported,” Gonzalez-Pagan added. “In many instances, LGBT people who are either overtly or subtly discriminated against in housing do not report the discrimination because of their immediate need to find housing or due to the costs of pursuing a claim. Property owners who engage in this kind of discrimination must be held accountable.”

Lambda Legal has long fought for the rights of LGBT people and families in all areas of life including housing and employment. A day prior to the ruling, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals issued an historic decision holding that discriminating against someone in employment because they are lesbian, gay or bisexual is a form of sex discrimination. And presently, Lambda Legal is appealing a suit against an Illinois senior living facility for failing to protect a resident from sex- and sexual orientation-based harassment.

Additional Background

Tonya and Rachel Smith are a loving, committed same-sex couple living in Colorado. They have been married for seven years and have two children, ages seven and three. Rachel is also transgender.

In early 2015, Tonya and Rachel were looking to find a new home for their young family. In April, they located a two-bedroom townhouse in the community of Gold Hill, Colorado, that seemed to meet all of their needs – affordable, lots of outdoor space where their children could play, and near a small, high quality public school. After meeting the landlord, Deepika Avanti, and touring both that unit and a three-bedroom unit on the same property, Tonya and Rachel believed they had found their dream home.

However, within hours, Avanti emailed Tonya and Rachel and informed them she would not be renting either unit to them, because she thought their “unique relationship” would become the focus of discussion in town and would harm her standing in the community. She added that she had kept a low profile for 30 years, but that would no longer be possible if she rented to them due to Tonya and Rachel’s “uniqueness.”

Handling the case for Lambda Legal are Omar Gonzalez-Pagan, Staff Attorney, and Karen Loewy, Senior Counsel. They are joined by pro-bono co-counsel Benjamin N. Simler of Holland & Hart LLP.

"When a gay man in Columbus, Oh., was threatened by a man using a homophobic slur, police acknowledged his concern that the incident may have been motivated by bias, but they got a key detail wrong in their incident report: They mistakenly marked it as a case of anti-heterosexual harassment, reports ProPublica. Since 2010, Columbus police have reported six incidents that list bias against heterosexuals as the purported motivation. That’s more than any other local law enforcement agency in the nation reported during that period. Columbus Police Department Sgt. Dean Worthington acknowledges it’s likely that the officers who filed the reports marked the wrong box.

Those reports made their way from Columbus to the FBI, where they were compiled with thousands of others into the Uniform Crime Report. Every year a small number of anti-heterosexual hate crime reports end up in the UCR. From 2010 to 2016, the FBI reported that local law enforcement agencies noted a total of 142 of them. ProPublica reviewed dozens of these reports, and found few, if any, actual hate crimes targeting people for being heterosexual. ProPublica sent Freedom of Information Act requests to every law enforcement agency that reported a heterosexual bias crime in 2016, and was able to locate records for 58 cases. None described hate crimes spurred by anti-heterosexual bias. As with the case in Columbus, about half were actually anti-gay or anti-bisexual crimes that were miscategorized. Seven cases appeared to reflect other types of bias, with victims targeted because they were Jewish or black or women. Some 18 cases don’t seem to have been hate crimes at all. The findings show that many local law enforcement agencies do a poor job tracking hate crimes. It’s a problem that can leave policy makers blind when grappling with the problem of hate crimes and bias incidents.",1

"While so many other Republicans are tucking tail and begging for mercy from the leftist hordes, state Senator Dan Bishop (R-Charlotte) is going on the offensive:

In the wake of the violence in Charlottesville, Va., Saturday after white supremacist events and counterprotests, a North Carolina state senator compared the Black Lives Matter movement to the supremacists. Republican Sen. Dan Bishop, who represents Senate District 39 in Mecklenburg County, said on Twitter Sunday that the “racist alt-right must be condemned” along with Antifa, an umbrella term for an activist anti-fascist movement, and Black Lives Matter, a group protesting police brutality and advocating for equality and black civil rights. […]

Really? This driveby has a very short memory. Black Lives Matter was the driving force behind those riots that tore Charlotte apart not too long ago. Here’s the left-wing crank Huffington Post:

[…] Destructive protests Tuesday that included shutting down eight-lane Interstate 85 and burning the contents of a tractor-trailer turned violent Wednesday. Along with the man shot to death, paramedics said two other people and six police officers suffered minor injuries. Wednesday’s protest started as a downtown prayer vigil, but an angry group left the vigil and marched through downtown Charlotte. They shouted “black lives matter” and “hands up; don’t shoot” while cursing at officers with bicycles blocking intersections. As the protesters approached the Omni hotel, officers in riot gear lined up outside arm in arm and a few marchers threw bottles and clods of dirt. […]

*Um, yeah. What a niiiiiiiice bunch of young people.*

Let’s not forget BLM’s role in stirring up Ferguson and Baltimore, as well.

Of course, the lefties showed so much tolerance and compassion for a POV that differed from theirs:

Another Twitter user, Jeb Stuart, whose profile says he is from Charlotte, asked Bishop whether he was equating BLM with those who wave Nazi flags. Bishop said yes, “both violent, racist movements.” Stuart: “What is racist about acknowledging the humanity of black people?” Bishop: “I had in mind their chant ‘pigs in a blanket, fry ’em like bacon.’ But knew better than to expect reciprocal decency.” Stuart: “Individuals vary, but are the fundamental purposes of those movements morally equivalent?” Bishop: “Chants usually collective acts. And my condemnation of extremists is unreciprocated.” Dozens of Twitter users had responded to Bishop’s tweet by Monday in opposition to his comments. One of the responses came from Wake County Commissioner John Burns, who told Bishop to resign.

Bishop was a leading advocate for HB2 and has been one of the few elected Republicans to not fold in the face of leftist fury. (Oh, to have just one or two more examples of courage on the right side of the aisle.)",1

"LOS ANGELES, CA -- Temperatures pushed their way into the 90s across much of the Southland Wednesday, along with gusty winds and low humidity that left the area prone to wildfires, and forecasters said things could get even hotter on Thursday. A red flag warning denoting a high risk of wildfire will remain in effect until 8 p.m. Thursday in the San Gabriel Mountains in L.A. and Ventura counties, the Angeles and Los Padres national forests, the Santa Monica Mountains, the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys, interior Orange County, and the L.A. County coast, which includes beach cities, metropolitan L.A.. and the Hollywood Hills. A high (pressure system) will bring gusty offshore winds through Thursday with temperatures at record levels, according to the National Weather Service, which noted that cooler temperatures are on the horizon. Then next week a large low will move in with possible precipitation from late Sunday to Monday with temperatures back to normal, according to the NWS. In the meantime, however, gusty winds will continue to blow through the area until Thursday night. Winds of 15 to 30 mph are expected, with gusts up to 45 mph in some valley and coastal areas and 55 mph in the mountains. Northeast winds will begin to diminish Thursday afternoon and night with much lighter winds on Friday, but widespread single-digit humidities will continue bringing continued elevated to possibly critical fire danger, especially for wind-prone mountain locations, according to the NWS. Widespread near-record high temperatures into the 90s with a few places reaching the low 100s for Thursday into Friday for the coasts and valleys will add to the fire danger. The NWS is forecasting a high temperature of 99 degrees in downtown Los Angeles Thursday -- topping the 96 anticipated in typically sizzling Palm Springs. Woodland Hills and Long Beach are expected to top out at 100 degrees. High temperatures will generally dip by about five degrees across the board on Friday, nearly 10 degrees more on Saturday, and back into the 70s by early next week.

"Police: No Evidence Break-in at Bloomington Mosque is a Hate Crime

There have been no arrests in the burglary or in the August bombing

BLOOMINGTON, Minn. — Police say there’s no evidence a recent break-in at a Bloomington mosque, that had earlier been targeted by a bomb, was a hate crime.

Authorities released this surveillance video of the break-in last Friday at the Dar Al Farooq Islamic Center which shows two intruders wearing ape or monkey masks.

Police say the suspects took a safe, money from collection jars and other items.

There have been no arrests in the burglary or in the August bombing.

"The LGBT community is slated Sunday to protest a sign in front of Remnant Fellowship Church (RFC) in Auburn, Indiana, that reads “LGBTQ is a hate crime against God, repent.”

Founded just months ago in April, the small Indiana church reminds passersby of its sign that “God sees your sin” and calls them to repent, and its bold and unapologetic mission makes it clear that it is making no compromises as the End Times approach.

[S]tand apart from the last days apostate church and stand for biblical truth and faithfulness to God and His Word, Remnant Fellowship Church’s mission statement reads, according to The Christian Post (CP).

No apologies for biblical warning

After many labeling the sign as “anti-LGBT” expressed outrage, the church did not buckle or apologize to observes who were offended by the sign, arguing that it is called by God to warn sinners and lead them to repentance.

Put this on church sign to reach a wicked and filthy generation,” RFC explained in a statement on its Facebook page Tuesday. “I pray God grant some repentance and life before the great Judgements about to be poured on this nation – especially the young people who have been sold lies so long and are [fed] a flood of filth every day. Jesus can save the vilest of sinners – many of us were saved out of wicked lives. Nothing is to[o] hard for God.

Remnant Fellowship leaders went on in the Facebook post to remind viewers that “wrongdoers will not inherit the Kingdom of God,” citing 1 Corinthians 6 to provide Scriptural authority to its warning.

Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the Kingdom of God, the church post added. And that is what some of you were, but you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.

Activist trying to paint LGBT in positive light

Many advocates and members of the local LGBT community in Auburn expressed outrage over the sign, with one resident, Kristin Russell, taking to Facebook to announce a planned protest on Sunday in front of the church.

“I wanted to say a few words about my goals and intentions of this peaceful protest,” Russell posted on Facebook Wednesday. “It is beyond a doubt that some of us have strong feelings about this church/sign and these beliefs, [so] I want everyone who comes to come with open arms and open minds – no hate allowed. Positive, progressive and loving signs are welcome and encouraged.”

The LGBT activist went on to call for peaceful signs to counter the RFC’s call to repentance from sin.

“Positive, progressive and loving signs are welcome and encouraged,” Russel continued. “Bring friends and family. Overall, I would just like the message of loving everyone – despite differences – to get across. Please, please do not bring any negativity with you, and let’s just show this church that Auburn stands with the LGBTQ+ community, and that God and churches can as well! I appreciate the support!”

Russell also took to Twitter to boast about altering the sign on private church property in order to align it with LGBT rhetoric.

It was unacceptable and needed to be changed, so I took matters into my own hands and did just that, Russell tweeted

She then informed that she had changed RFC’s sign to reflect the LGBT community’s message of tolerance and acceptance so that it read, Remnant Fellowship Church Stay Open Minded.

Russell insisted that the church’s message adversely affected her both physically and emotionally.

My whole body started to just tense up and shake when I saw it, Russell claimed. I drive by that a couple of times a day, knowing that hundreds of people are driving by. I didnt want that type of thing plastered to my community and to my town, and I really needed it to say something that was more open-minded and loving and more accepting.

She then indicated that the church’s original message was since restored.

Community outrage

Another supporter of the LGBT community, Tiffany Johnson, told the local news television station that she is upset about the church’s message on the sign.

It makes me upset,” Johnston expressed to NewsChannel 15. “Im outraged and disgusted by it – its judging people.”

She shared that she has homosexual and bisexual friends and family, contending that she does not want her children to be raised in a hateful world that she says the church’s sign represents.

“I felt judged, and Im not even in that community, but I have family members that are, so it really, really upset me,” Johnson voiced. “I dont think it should be up here. I think it should be taken down because all its doing is spreading hate.

No apologies for God’s Word

Robert Sturges, an elder at RFC, said that the sign is not a personal statement of the church – but that it serves as a warning from God found in Scripture, which cautions readers that a man who sleeps with another man is “detestable” to God, who stands against such sexual perversion.

Were trying to reach a certain group of people, Sturges told NewsChannel 15 in an interview. Theyre being told in our culture that homosexuality, transvestites, lesbianism and sexual immorality is OK, but the Bible clearly says that those who practice these things will not inherit the Kingdom of God.”

He considers the sign to be loving warning to those who are destined to hell – an indicated that others in the Church refuse to love sinners enough to alert them to their abysmal eternal destiny if they continue on in their ways.

“In fact, it warns them that the wrath of God will abide upon them – and in the judgment, they will be lost, and they will be sent to Hell forever,” Sturges continued. “We believe that – thats our faith.

The elder also alerted viewers to the deceptions of tolerating sin, stressing that fear of man’s rejection is no excuse for Christians to neglect their duty of sharing the whole Gospel message, even though many may consider parts to be offensive.

He asserted that because his church believes in the Bible and stands firm in its beliefs, it will continue to love the lost enough to warn them about impending doom if they do not turn from their unnatural lifestyles.

We do love them, Sturges insisted. But we want to warn them that they are headed toward a cliff, and if they keep going that way, theyll be destroyed – and that is what the sign is about.

The Christian leader went on to argue that the LGBTQ lifestyle destroys lives and deceives children to follow a perilous path that leads to a life of pain and suffering.

Even the schools are telling the kids go ahead and experiment,” Sturges pointed out. “Theyre going to destroy kids at young ages. Theyre opening themselves up to disease and mental illness and making them the enemies of God, who calls them to sexual purity. Thats why we put the sign up.

Apostate church speaks up

Representing the apostate church to which Sturges referred – which embraces instead of addressing sin in the world – a pastor from a church up the street, First Christian Church (FCC), described the sign as being confrontational and combative.

FCC Pastor Tim Cupka – whose congregation lets people believe whatever they that want regarding sexual orientations and lifestyles – believes that churches must be seeker-friendly and all inclusive … in essence, embracing sinful behavior.

Were going to worship in unity, Cupka insisted, according to NewsChannel15. Anyone who is pursuing faith is going to be fed. A message like that – that is displayed there – would tend to be exclusive. It would exclude people from that particular denomination or that particular community, and that would not resonate with us at all.”

He then attempted to justify his congregation not challenging sinners to come to repentance – out of fear of a confrontation.

“Were not going to go head to head with somebody,” Cupka emphasized. “Our job is not to dictate your faith, but to feed you Gods Word.",1

"James Whitey Bulger made an initial appearance in federal court today and  assented to remain detained while he awaits official arraignment, which will probably happen sometime next week. Bulger was escorted into the courtroom by three federal marshals. He was dressed in a white V-neck T-shirt, an open button-down white shirt, dark slacks and sneakers when he appeared before two federal judges this afternoon at the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse in South Boston. Outside the courthouse, a large crowd of spectators and media outlets gathered, many hoping to catch a glimpse of the notorious alleged gangster as he left or entered the courthouse. Inside, the courtroom in which Bulger made his appearance was filled with reporters, court officials and other interested people. Two other court rooms, set up to deal with the expected an overflow of people, also filled up, and courthouse officials ultimately sent people into the jury room. On the Boston Harbor side of the courthouse, armed Coast Guard and Boston Police boats patrolled the waters nearest the building. After the hearing, Bulgers brother, William Bulger, former president of the Massachusetts Senate, was surrounded by reporters as he walked toward his car. The court proceedings today mainly dealt with reading charges brought against Bulger and initiating the process whereby he would find an attorney to represent him. He first made an appearance minutes before 4 p.m. in front of Judge Leo Sorokin. The proceeding lasted no more than 15 minutes. He then had a second appearance, at about 4:14 p.m., in front of Judge Marianne Bowler. Both judges read the charges brought against Bulger. Those include the following: — Conspiracy under RICO (the Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organizations Act) — Substantive RICO count — Violation of the Hobbs Act, which deals with extortion, robbery and interstate commerce violations — Several counts of money laundering — Possession of firearms in furtherance of violent crime — Possession of machine guns — Possession of unregistered machine guns — Transfer and possession of machine guns — Possession of machine guns with obliterated serial numbers Appointing Bulgers attorneyWhile most of this afternoons proceedings were a formality, one matter of substance was addressed: the question of whether Bulger was eligible to receive a court-appointed attorney or whether he could afford his own. Assistant United States Attorney Brian Kelly argued that Bulger had the capacity to afford his own attorney. He was found with over $800,000 cash, he said, adding, We think he has access to family resources. Kelly also said there were 30 guns found with the guy as well, so we certainly dont think this is his last cache. Bulger, who made no comments during the proceedings other than to answer yes or no questions from the judges, did say, in a mumbled voice, that he didnt have money for a lawyer because federal authorities seized it. Judge Leo Sorokin appointed attorney Peter Krupp to serve as Bulgers counsel until Bulger receives, through court appointment or by hire, another attorney Remaining in detainmentOn the issue of bail, proceedings did not progress far. Kelly said, We do believe [Bulger] is dangerous to the community and that he is a risk of flight. Krupp, after consulting Bulger, said, At this point well assent to the detention without waiving any rights. Catherine GreigBulgers female companion for the past 16 years, Catherine Greig, also made a court appearance, before Judge Jennifer Boal. Greig was charged with harboring a fugitive.",0

"Graffiti outside Jewish deli in Naperville being called a hate crime

hello

Vandals damaged the sidewalk outside a popular Jewish deli in Naperville after the business closed for the day Sunday, and both the owner and police are calling it a hate crime.

The phrase Free Gaza was spray-painted in black on the sidewalk near the front door at Schmaltz Deli, 1512 N. Naper Blvd., about 3 p.m. Sunday.

The phrase refers to the Israeli-Egyptian blockade imposed on the Gaza Strip, a small, Palestinian-governed territory in the Middle East.

Nothing else was damaged.

Restaurant owner Howard Bender said he was surprised by the vandalism, and angry.

Its a hate crime, he told the Daily Herald during a break from trying to remove the paint. Were all shocked.

Police also are considering the vandalism a hate crime because of where it occurred, as well as a case of criminal damage to property and disorderly conduct, Cmdr. Lou Cammiso said.

If Free Gaza had been sprayed onto a viaduct or somewhere random, it would have been a political statement, Cammiso said. But at a deli affiliated with a particular religion, he said it meets the definition of a hate crime, an illegal act committed because of a bias against someone in a constitutionally protected class, including ethnicity, religion, ancestry and national origin.

The message being Free Gaza was obviously left there because it was a Jewish deli, Cammiso said. The religion of the owners, coupled with the message of the criminal act makes it a hate crime.

Bender said the restaurant has operated for nearly 13 years and called Naperville a wonderful community. His staff and customers are a mix of Jews and gentiles.

The business opened as scheduled Monday. I wouldnt close, no way in the world, Bender said.

Bender added posters reading Hate Has No Home Here to the restaurants windows during the day.

He addressed the vandalism in a post on the restaurants Facebook page.

Schmaltz is one of the only Jewish restaurants in the area, and we are proud to support the local Jewish community and all members of our community, Bender wrote. When an American Jewish business is targeted for the actions of another country, and when Jews are lumped together when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it is not productive, it is anti-Semitism.

Bender went on to say he knows this is not the true Naperville, and he encouraged people to be kind to people different from them.

When we take the time to learn from each other, we are actively creating a more compassionate and loving society, Bender wrote.

Naperville police are investigating the vandalism. Investigators hope to review surveillance video footage from the restaurant and neighboring businesses, Cammiso said.

Naperville police havent received any other recent reports of anti-Semitic vandalism, Cammiso said.",1

"An Orland Park man was viciously beaten by three guys his ex-girlfriend called up to beat him down, police said. An officer sent to investigate a report of a man who had been jumped and battered outside a Streamstown Court home found the man standing in the street in front of his residence, police said. The man was staggering around and appeared to be very disoriented, police said. He had red and purple blotchy bruises covering his entire face which appeared puffy and swollen, his left eye was swelling shut, his lips were very bloody and his legs were covered in blood, cuts and scrapes. The man then yelled his ex-girlfriend did this to him, stating, She set me up, police said. He reportedly identified his ex-girlfriend as 21-year-old Yara Zayed of Orland Hills and claimed she had three or four of her friends just come over to beat him up. The man explained that (he) and Yara have been having personal issues lately so they decided to talk it out tonight, police said. He picked her up from her home, brought her to his house and they spoke while parked in his driveway, but after a short time got into a verbal argument over one of Yaras guy friends named Robert. Zayed struck and scratched the man, police said, and he fled from the car. After some time Yara got out of the vehicle and started screaming at her ex-boyfriend, police said. The man advised Yara repeatedly told him her friends were coming to beat him up. Zayed and her ex-boyfriend continued arguing until a red Mercedes pulled into his driveway and almost struck him as he had to jump out of the way, police said. Three or four men emerged from the car, knocked the ex-boyfriend to the ground and took turns punching and kicking him. The man reportedly told officers that his attackers took off in the red Mercedes with Yara. The beaten man reportedly refused a trip to the hospital. The police tracked Zayed and the three men down at a residence in Orland Hills. All four were taken into custody. Zayed was charged with domestic battery. Her male companions — Rakan Awadalla, 18, of Tinley Park, Omar Khattab, 18, also of Tinley Park, and Robert Knez, 20, of Orland Hills — all were charged with battery. Zayed was allegedly combative with police after she was taken into custody. Yara immediately began swearing at me, calling me bitch over and over again, an officer said, according to a police report. Zayed also allegedly threw her earrings to the ground when asked to remove them and was otherwise uncooperative at the police station.

"Documenting Hate Tracking Hate Crimes and Bias Incidents

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — There was nothing haphazard about the violence that erupted today in this bucolic town in Virginia’s heartland. At about 10 a.m. today, at one of countless such confrontations, an angry mob of white supremacists formed a battle line across from a group of counter-protesters, many of them older and gray-haired, who had gathered near a church parking lot. On command from their leader, the young men charged and pummeled their ideological foes with abandon. One woman was hurled to the pavement, and the blood from her bruised head was instantly visible.

A.C. Thompson is covering the rise in hate crimes in America as part of our Documenting Hate project. If youve witnessed or been the victim of a hate crime or bias incident — in Charlottesville or elsewhere — tell us your story.

Standing nearby, an assortment of Virginia State Police troopers and Charlottesville police wearing protective gear watched silently from behind an array of metal barricades — and did nothing.

It was a scene that played out over and over in Charlottesville as law enforcement confronted the largest public gathering of white supremacists in decades. We walked the streets beginning in the early morning hours and repeatedly witnessed instances in which authorities took a largely laissez faire approach, allowing white supremacists and counter-protesters to physically battle.

Officials in Charlottesville had publicly promised to maintain control of the “Unite the Right” rally, which is the latest in a series of chaotic and bloody racist rallies that have roiled this college town, a place deeply proud of its links to Thomas Jefferson and the origins of American Democracy.

But the white supremacists who flooded into the city’s Emancipation Park — a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee sits in the center of the park — had spent months openly planning for war. The Daily Stormer, a popular neo-Nazi website, encouraged rally attendees to bring shields, pepper spray, and fascist flags and flagpoles. A prominent racist podcast told its listeners to come carrying guns. “Bring whatever you need, that you feel you need for your self defense. Do what you need to do for security of your own person,” said Mike “Enoch” Peinovich on The Right Stuff podcast.

And the white supremacists who showed up in Charlottesville did indeed come prepared for violence. Many wore helmets and carried clubs, medieval-looking round wooden shields, and rectangular plexiglass shields, similar to those used by riot police.

Clad in a black, Nazi-style helmet, Matthew Heimbach told ProPublica, “We’re defending our heritage.” Heimbach, who heads the Traditionalist Workers Party, a self-declared fascist group, said he was willing to die for his cause and would do whatever it took to defend himself. He was surrounded by a brigade of white supremacists, including members of the League of the South and the National Socialist Movement.

By the time Heimbach and his contingent arrived in downtown Charlottesville shortly before 11 a.m., what had started hours earlier with some shoving and a few punches had evolved into a series of wild melees as people attacked one another with fists, feet, and the improvised weapons they’d brought with them to the park. White supremacists and anti-racists began blasting each other with thick orange streams of pepper spray.

The police did little to stop the bloodshed. Several times, a group of assault-rifle-toting militia members from New York State, wearing body armor and desert camo, played a more active role in breaking up fights.

Shortly before noon, authorities shut down the rally and the related demonstrations and marched the white supremacists out of the park and into the streets.

Charlottesville Vice Mayor Wes Bellamy defended the police tactics. “I’m not in the business of throwing our police department under the bus, because they’re doing the best job they can, “ said Bellamy. “I don’t think the police officers were just twiddling their thumbs.”

The skirmishes culminated in what appears to have been an act of domestic terrorism, with a driver ramming his car into a crowd of anti-racist activists on a busy downtown street, killing one and injuring 19 according to the latest information from city officials. Charlottesville authorities tonight reported that a 20-year-old Ohio man had been arrested and had been charged with murder.

Two state police officers also died in a helicopter crash.

At a brief press conference this evening, Virginia officials declined to answer questions about the police response, but said they were not taken surprise by the violence or the number of protesters. “This could have been a much worse day,” said Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, “We planned for a long time for today’s incidents.”

Charlottesville police Chief Al Thomas said at least 35 people had been injured — many of them from violent encounters between white supremacists and the counter-protesters. He said nobody had been wounded due to confrontations between police and the public.

In the weeks leading up to the protest, city and state officials put together a detailed plan for the rally, mobilizing 1,000 first responders, including 300 state police troopers and members of the National Guard. Judging from how events unfolded today, it appears that the strategy was to avoid direct confrontations with the protesters.

Miriam Krinsky, a former federal prosecutor who has worked on police reform efforts in Los Angeles, said it was too early to assess the law enforcement response in Charlottesville.

But she said a strategy of disengagement generally works to embolden unruly crowds.

“If things start to escalate and there’s no response, it can very quickly get out of control,” she said. “Individuals can and will get hurt.”

But an overly forceful response, she said, can also make the situation worse. Krinsky said attempts to seize weapons might have led to more clashes between police and protesters. “Trying to take things away from people is unlikely to be a calming influence,” she told ProPublica.

A good strategy, she said, is to make clashes less likely by separating the two sides physically, with officers forming a barrier between them. “Create a human barrier so the flash points are reduced as quickly as possible,” she said.",1
"CROFTON, MD — A Washington, D.C., man died Tuesday morning when he was hit by three vehicles while crossing a Crofton road on foot, authorities say. Larnell Lavorne Dugger, 60, of 1811 N Capital St N.E. in Washington, D.C., died in the accident. Anne Arundel County Police were called to Crain Hwy (MD-3) southbound near Capital Raceway Road in Crofton about 5:45 a.m. Tuesday.  A Honda Accord was southbound on MD-3 approaching Capital Raceway Road when it struck Dugger, who was reportedly standing in the left lane of the road. Dugger was then struck by two other southbound vehicles. All three of the vehicles remained at the scene. Dugger was declared dead at the scene by fire department personnel and his body was taken to the Medical Examiners office in Baltimore for autopsy.  The preliminary cause of the crash appears to be Dugger not yielding to vehicles while in the roadway outside of a crosswalk, police said. Neither speed nor alcohol appears to be involved on the part of the drivers. Any charges are pending review by the states attorney. The drivers involved in the accident are:",0
"The Helena police chief said Saturday that hes 100 percent in agreement with Mayor Mark Hall who told a Birmingham TV station Friday that the city wont tolerate crime involving hate or intimidation because of a persons race or religious beliefs.

Chief Pete Folmars comment to AL.com comes one day after he said that his department investigating a case of vandalism to a Muslim familys vehicles as criminal mischief.

We will not tolerate such things, said Folmar. Now for me to tell you that (hatred toward Muslims) is what is behind this, I cannot do that at this point. I dont have any idea. Obviously, you can draw your own inferences on what was written.

The Muslim family with Middle Eastern heritage had its van spray-painted with the N-word, according to a news release issued by the Alabama chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. In addition, CAIR reports that the family discovered early Friday broken windows, flat tires and motor oil poured over three vehicles.

Folmar said there were references to the KKK also spray-painted, as well as obscene images of male genitals.

Were working on this through the weekend and well continue to work on it until we either make a case or absolutely dont have any more leads, said Folmar.

CAIR, in its news release, called on federal and state law enforcement authorities to investigate the incident as a possible hate crime.

Obviously in this case, there is a clear statement of bigotry in the use of the N-word, said Ibrahim Hooper, national spokesman with CAIR. Based on the fact the people involved are Muslim ... and based on the overall rise in bigotry, it would only be common sense to investigate a bias motive.

Hall, Helenas mayor, told ABC 33/40 that he instructed Follmer to use all resources available to make an arrest. Hall could not be reached for comment Saturday morning.

Folmars initial classification of the incident as criminal mischief could potentially be enhanced to a felony case if an investigation shows that the perpetrator who committed the crime was motivated by the victims actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity or physical or mental disability.

Hooper, with CAIR, said the incident is more than a situation of just teenagers causing mischief. He said he supported the mayors statement.

I think we would welcome that kind of response from public officials and thats the kind of public response we ask for from not only the local level, but at the state and national level, said Hooper.

The incident in Helena comes after the U.S. Department of Justice reported last month that between 2011 to 2015, 54 percent of violent hate crimes went unreported. Around a third of those victims were targeted because of their ethnicity, the report stated.

Hooper said that hate crimes have been rising since the 2016 presidential election and the inauguration of President Donald Trump, who has called for a ban on Muslims from certain countries from entering the U.S.

In Helena, Folmar said he cannot remember in this two years as police chief having to investigate a case in which someone was victimized because of their religious beliefs.

A GoFundMe page was set up to raise money for the family with a goal of $2,000. The goal was reached Saturday, with $2,270 raised.

The victimized family, on the GoFundMe page, wrote that they have resided in Helena for five years and never had problems with anyone before the incident occurred.

Said Folmar: We have the lowest crime rate for a city our size in Alabama. Relatively speaking, any sort of crime is rare in Helena based on our crime rate. However, of the crimes we have, criminal mischief is one of the more common.",1
"Sonoma police are investigating a suspected hate crime after a Sonoma Valley school employee reported he was assaulted by a masked person, possibly wielding a stick, after he walked out of his workplace Thursday night and found his vehicle tagged with derogatory words.

The victim, an employee at the El Verano Family Resource Center at El Verano Elementary School, had returned to campus at about 8:10 p.m. to retrieve a personal item inside his office, Sonoma Valley Unified School District Superintendent Louann Carlomagno wrote in a letter to families of El Verano students Friday morning.

When the victim came out of the school, he saw the word “beaner” and another epithet had been spray-painted on his car, Sonoma Police Chief Bret Sackett said.

The employee then saw a person wearing dark clothing, a hoodie and a mask over his face, Sackett said. The assailant struck the school employee on the arm with an object, possibly a stick, then fled on foot without saying a word, Sackett said.

The employee, who was shaken up but not seriously injured, was driven home by a school custodian after speaking to Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office deputies, Carlomagno said. The man later went to the emergency room and was released.

Sonoma police are treating the incident as a potential hate crime, Sackett said.

“Hate crimes deal with motivation and we don’t know the motivation,” Sackett said. “But this has the overtones of a potential hate crime.”

The suspect has been described as likely a male, 5 foot 8 to 5 feet 10 inches tall. No other identifying information was immediately available.

Deputies were canvassing the neighborhood for more information, Sackett said.

“It is disheartening to see this happen on one of our campuses,” Carlomagno wrote in her letter. “El Verano School, as well as all the schools in our valley, prioritize the safety of our students, staff and campus visitors. We are constantly reviewing the security procedures and will continue to do so.”

"STAFFORD, CT — A 53-year-old Stafford resident has been charged in a neglect case that included a hypothermic child living in a home with 35-degree interior temperatures, an arrest warrant indicates. The investigation was initiated in December, when a Stafford Ambulance crew was sent to 18 West End St. in Stafford for a possible overdose. Vanessa Laskow was in the home, confused and unable to walk, and she admitted taking Klonopin and Codeine, according to a warrant. The home was unkempt and canine feces was located inside the house, according to a warrant. Parts of the home had an odor of spoiled food, according to a warrant. The inside temperature was 35 degrees and residents told authorities the home had been without heat for some time, according to a warrant. A wood stove was in the home but no wood was present, according to a warrant. The ambulance crew was concerned that a 7-month-old was hypothermic. A pillow had a bottle propped up in what seemed like a system for the youngster to feed himself, according to a warrant. Authorities said in a warrant the home was unfit for an infant. She apparently obtained the Klonopin from a relative who has schizophrenia, according to a warrant. Lawkow was charged with second-degree reckless endangerment and risk of injury to a child, according to a warrant. She is due in court in May 14, state police said.

"NORWALK, OH — Creepy clowns have arrived in Ohio, or at least weird reports of them have. Residents in Norwalk reported several incidents involving people dressed as clowns harassing pedestrians last week, sending police officers there on a wild goose chase throughout the city. After a night of chasing clowns, however, police concluded that the whole affair had been a prank that got out of hand. Someone posted a photo of two clowns on Facebook, and that post was shared more than 1,000 times. Then the calls started coming in. Police concluded that many of the reports had been exaggerated, potentially deliberately, and located two suspects, one of whom just wanted to get famous. Officers also said they were going to review recorded incident calls to try and identify voices and ensure each report wasnt part of a larger prank. The calls started on the night of Sept. 22 when Norwalk police began receiving reports of four men, dressed like clowns, riding bicycles and harassing pedestrians on Cline Street. When police arrived on the scene, there were no clowns. They were, however, approached by a resident wanting to make another complaint about the clowns. At 12:20 a.m., police received a call saying there were clowns loitering in the woods behind H&B Hop, an ice cream parlor at 296 W. Main St. The clowns were allegedly jumping out of the woods and attempting to scare people walking by. At 1:43 a.m., a resident on Concord Court complained that she had seen a clown attempting to break into her house. Neighbors of the resident said they had been outside and hadnt seen any suspicious activity. As the night continued to get stranger, callers began complaining that a motorcycle group was allegedly hunting for the clowns as well. However, officers only located three individuals sitting in a parked car on Glover Avenue. They said they had located the clowns on Facebook and that one of the clowns had taken a selfie at Norwalk Recreation Center. Police told the three people to go home. Using Facebook photos posted by the suspects, officers were eventually able to track down the residence of one of the clowns. The suspect spoke to police the day after the incidents. He initially denied taking part in the pranks, said he was falsely accused on social media, and repeatedly asked officers if he could work as an undercover agent. Eventually, he admitted that he and his girlfriend dressed up as clowns but said he only walked outside of his residence. He said he got the idea from a video they saw on the internet and that he had no intention of scaring anyone. However, the suspects girlfriend posted a picture of the duo dressed as clowns and claimed to have spotted them on the way back from a restaurant. When the photo went viral, her boyfriend begged her to take it down, but she didnt. He claimed she wanted to be famous. Police now believe that many people who posted on Facebook claiming to have seen the clowns were merely re-posting screen shots and claiming to have seen the clowns roaming throughout town. Wellington Police, though denying having made a post about the clown incident, did paste a warning to potential clowners on their Facebook page. Wellington is about 30 minutes from Norwalk. This Ohio incident follows a wave of clown-based crimes and reports in the south. Most recently, an Alabama man was arrested after he approached shoppers at a Georgia Walmart dressed like a clown. That incident followed a wave of reported clown sightings that swept through Georgia after first popping up in North Carolina and South Carolina in the past months. Image via Pixabay",0
"Beverly Hills has named a new police chief and shes coming from Northern California. San Leandros police Chief Sandra Spagnoli will take over for Interim Police Chief Dominick Rivetti, who has been managing the department since last June. Chief David Snowden of the Beverly Hills Police Department announced his retirement last June. Before joining San Leandros department in 2011, Spagnoli was police chief in Benicia and previously worked for 16 years with the San Carlos Police Department. I am looking forward to becoming part of the City of Beverly Hills team and building on the legacy of excellence in City services and safety, Spagnoli said. The community and police department have an outstanding reputation and it is an honor to be selected as the next police chief in Beverly Hills. Spagnoli could find herself with a much lighter workload at her new assignment. While San Leandro has a population of about 88,000 residents, Beverly Hills has less than half that at fewer than 35,000. --Bay City News Service contributed to this report, photo courtesy of the city of Beverly Hills",0
"MENLO PARK, CA — A fire ripped through a Menlo Park home late Thursday, but thanks to some quick-thinking neighbors and a fast fire department response, the structure was spared from total destruction, the Menlo Park Fire Protection District said Friday. The fire was first reported at 9:24 p.m. on La Loma Drive in the Sharon Heights area of Menlo Park, according to fire officials. The neighbors had first smelled smoke and thought it was a barb-q but upon further investigation when they went outside, they could see fire inside the two story home, the fire district said in a news release. Firefighters were at the scene within three minutes and found flames pouring out of the middle of the home, as well as on the second level. Complicating and challenging the firefighting efforts was exterior scaffolding which partially surrounded the large 6,000 square foot tri-level hillside home, which was under construction, according to the fire district. However, officials say they got to the scene just in time to prevent the blaze from growing out of control. We caught this fire just as it was starting to mushroom and expand into the upper floors of the building, Menlo Fire Battalion Chief Tom Calvert said. If it had been allowed to burn a few minutes more, the whole house would have been on fire due to the significant preheating and smoke propagation. By 9:47 p.m., the fire was under control. The combination of the neighbors timely discovery of this fire and the firefighters catching it just as it was about to spread into the upper floors, prevented this fire from completely destroying the house, Fire Chief Harold Schapelhouman said in a statement. The access challenges the firefighters faced due to the construction, didnt help, but they pushed past them. We are estimating that the damage to the structure is around $150,000 but could go higher based upon where the fire occurred and the damage it created within the first and second floor supporting members and the extensive smoke and heat damage throughout the building. Crews remained at the site until around 2 a.m. for full overhaul. The cause is under investigation. -- PHOTO 1:  Firefighters on Menlo Truck 1 cut apart a garage door so that other Firefighters can gain access to the fire in a room and stairway behind the garage.

"The Sound Credit Union’s staff tells Jamela Mohamed to remove her headgear while they attended other clients with their caps on.

Staff at the Sound Credit Union in Kent, Washington, apparently, asked a Muslim American woman to remove her headgear before taking service. Jamela Mohamed, the alleged victim, wrote on her Facebook account on May 6 that she is Muslim woman and was observing Jummah the previous day – Muslims observe Friday for prayers and, mostly, Muslim women keep their heads covered.

Mohamed wrote that she had gone to pay her bill, as in any other day. However, that day being a Friday, she had her head covered. When the staff objected, she went back to her car to grab a hijab (a headgear and article of faith for Muslim women). To her surprise, when she returned, she noticed that while she was refused service because of her headgear, two other people, who were wearing caps, were being attended without objection.

“The teller asks me to “take off my hood”. In order to adhere to their policy, I ran outside to get my hijab. When I came back, two men before me were served with no issues, but both were wearing hats,” Mohamed wrote on Facebook.

Member of the South Credit Union, Mohamed pulled out her phone camera and started recording the incident on the spot. The video shows that a woman staff member asks Mohamed to stop filming and leave the place at the count of three, or else she would call the 911.

Eventually, Mohammed was escorted out of the premises. In the video, Mohamed is seen crying and complaining that she was “completely embarrassed” and that “the lady [staffer] literally followed” her out. “I never want this to happen to anybody and NOBODY should ever be treated this way,” she said.

The one-minute-34-second video, which looks edited in a couple of places, was viewed more than 870,000 times on Facebook; Nearly 8,500 people shared it online.

In response, Sound Credit Union apologized for the incident on Facebook. The Bank’s authorities tweeted on May 9, “We have been reviewing a video that was posted to social media that documents an interaction that occurred at the Kent Branch recently. As a credit union, we believe in equal treatment for all.”

As a credit union, we believe in equal treatment for all.

"SAN JOSE - A Santa Clara police officer was convicted Monday of indecent exposure at a high-end San Jose store last year. A Santa Clara County Superior Court jury found Thomas Leipelt, 46, guilty of the single misdemeanor charge today after a three-day trial before Judge Paul Bernal at the Hall of Justice in San Jose. Leipelt was off-duty when he exposed himself to an employee at Annieglass, a luxury glassware store at Santana Row Shopping Center, while visiting his girlfriend on May 15. You always have to respect the jury in their verdict but Im very, very disappointed and just having a hard time understanding how they came to that conclusion given what happened in the trial, Leipelts attorney Cameron Bowman said after todays verdict. Bowman said he plans to ask the court for Leipelt to be released and will appeal the verdict. Leipelt was placed into custody and is scheduled for sentencing on Wednesday, when he faces up to a year in county jail, Bowman said. Leipelt could also be required to register as a sex offender for life. The employee who made the complaint testified that she went to retrieve documents from a printer in the stores back room, where she saw Leipelt naked and masturbating. The employee said Leipelt asked her to come here but she refused and stepped back out to the payment counter. Leipelts then-girlfriend, who was the only other person working at the store, was speaking to friends at the front of the store when the incident occurred and repeatedly apologized to the employee. The victim said she informed her boss of the incident two days after and reported the incident to police later that month. Leipelt had testified that he was partially clothed and the employee walked in on him using the bathroom. Bowman argued last week that the victims testimony was unreliable and she failed to inform the court of a restraining order she filed in 2009 for indecent exposure. Leipelt has worked with Santa Clara police for 15 years and was placed on paid administrative leave in May, Santa Clara police Lt. Kurt Clarke said. The police administrative investigation into Leipelt can now be finalized with the criminal case coming to a close, Clarke said. Santa Clara County Deputy District Attorney Lindsay Walsh, who was the prosecutor on the case, said she thought the verdict was fair. Walsh said Leipelts story was completely unbelievable and the victims account has been consistent. -Bay City News, image via ShutterStock",0

"Colorado twins are both facing assault and hate crime charges after they were caught on video brawling and hurling racial slurs at a Hispanic family, according to local reports.

Blond sisters Natasha and Shala Fross, 26, can be seen in widely shared cellphone footage fighting with a woman and her daughter on a residential street in Commerce City.

“Look at yourself compared to me! Who are you? Who are you compared to us,” one of the sisters shouts in the clip in which one of the siblings can be heard yelling, “old fat Mexican b—-es.”

When officers arrive, the sisters claim they were attacked as they continue to shout at the family members.

“This is not looking good for you. Go wait at your house,” the officer says to the antagonistic women in the clip.

Carlos Ruiz, whose mom was targeted in the attack, wrote on Facebook that she was at their neighbors’ house “when these 2 girls started screaming from across the street racist things, saying how TF do Mexicans have money 2 own houses we do and have the cars we do, saying stuff like leave our country!!”

“That’s when my mom started walking back to our house and these girls ran up 2 her and started punching her and pulling on her hair!” the post read.

Ruiz went on to say that his sister then came out of the house to get the girls off his mom.

“[S]o then they both started hitting my sister, I tried helping her and so did my brother in law but she just told us not 2 touch these girls because we could get in trouble, so we stayed back and recorded and took pictures for evidence,” the man wrote.

He added: “We aren’t here to harm anyone! just live a life like everyone else! this is the type of stuff we have 2 deal with for wanting a better life!.”

Ruiz also took a shot at President Trump, saying, “People think racism is a joke…its 2018 and this is the stuff our president promotes!!”

In an interview with FOX31 Denver, Ruiz said the Fross sisters “were just going crazy.”

“I had never seen them before. I didn’t even know they lived here, so it was weird.”

“They were just screaming ‘fat Mexicans’ and ‘get out of here’ — things like, ‘who are you’… making it seem like we are less,” he told the news outlet.

According to FOX31 Denver, the Adams County District Attorney’s Office is handling the case.",1
"Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for 18-year-old Andrew Vrba, who has been implicated in the violent death of trans teenager Ally Steinfeld. The case garnered national attention because of the slayings brutality: Steinfeld had been stabbed in the genitals and her eyes had been gouged out before her body was set on fire.

Steinfeld, who was 17 years old, was killed in September of 2017 near the small town of Cabool, Missouri. Vrba was charged with first-degree murder, abandonment of a corpse and armed criminal action, according to The Kansas City Star. Vrba has allegedly admitted to stabbing Steinfeld, telling police he bragged about the killing to friends.

Vrba is not the only one implicated in Steinfelds murder.

One female suspect, Isis Schauer, 18, has pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, and has been sentenced to 20 years in prison, according to The Star. A third suspect, Briana Calderas, 24, awaits trial on first-degree murder charges. One last suspect has pleaded not guilty to abandonment of a corpse and tampering with physical evidence.

Vrbas attorneys have not offered a comment on prosecutors seeking the death penalty, according to NBC News.

Steinfelds alleged murderers were not charged with hate crimes, sparking outcry from LGBTQ advocacy groups. County Sheriff James Sigman and prosecutor Parke Stevens Jr. have claimed the killing was not motivated by Steinfelds gender identity.

I would say murder in the first-degree is all that matters, Stevens told the Associated Press at the time. That is a hate crime in itself.

LGBTQ groups continue to speak out against the courts decision pertaining to the hate crime status.

The desecration of Steinfield’s body is a direct correlation to the way trans bodies are spoken about — in so-called bathroom bills, in public transitions and in death, Audacia Ray, director of community organizing and public advocacy at the Anti-Violence Project, said to NBC News. This is especially true for trans women, and trans feminine individuals, whose vulnerability to violence is amplified by misogyny.

Meanwhile, other LGBTQ groups are speaking out against the death penalty. The National Center for Transgender Equality, for example, has issued a statement saying it does not support the death penalty.

While investigating crimes against transgender people and holding individuals responsible is important, our vision of justice is not focused on ‘tough’ sentences but on confronting a climate of hate that too many of our leaders are promoting, and pursuing policies that value transgender people while they are alive, Harper Jean Tobin, the organizations director of policy, said in a statement sent to NBC News.

There have been at least eight known transgender victims of homicide in the year 2018, according to data from the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group.

People who identify as transgender face considerable violence, according to HRC President Chad Griffin.

“The epidemic of violence against transgender people is an urgent crisis that demands the nations immediate attention,” said Griffin. “The unique and tragic stories featured in this report reflect the obstacles that many transgender Americans — especially trans women of color — face in their daily lives. It is crucial that we know these stories in order to combat the transphobia, misogyny and racism fueling this violence so that we can end this epidemic before it takes any more lives.”

"MINNEAPOLIS, MN — Twin Cities Metro Transit police officers checking fares on buses and trains vehicles have a routine: They board, announce tickets will be checked then go through the process from one end of the train to the other ensuring all passengers have paid their fares. On occasion, they will have officers from other agencies in tow. For more than a decade, members of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response team have been among those partner agencies, according to a news release. They are an extension of DHS security, members of the Transportation Security Administration or Air Marshals, that are often seen at airports and occasionally branch out to transportation in cities throughout the country. In the Twin Cities metro, the team works in conjunction with Metro Transit police officers and does no transit enforcement on its own.

"Attorney General Jeff Sessions. (Photo: Adam Wesley / AP)

Washington — Jefferson Beauregard Sessions, a son of the segregated South who was named after leaders of the Confederacy, faces a tough new test of his commitment to protecting civil rights as he oversees the Justice Department’s investigation of the deadly violence at a rally of white nationalists in Virginia.

Sessions’ political career has been dogged by questions about race, including during his confirmation hearings this year. In his six months as attorney general, he has worked quickly to change how the department enforces civil rights law, particularly in the areas of police reform and voting rights.

Yet Sessions was also quick to forcefully condemn the car attack at the neo-Nazi rally in support of a Confederate statue in Charlottesville. His response stood in contrast to that of President Donald Trump, who drew equivalence between the white nationalists and those protesting their beliefs. Sessions denounced racism and bigotry and called the driver’s actions an “evil” act of domestic terrorism worthy of a federal civil rights investigation.

Observers say the real test will be in what Sessions does next, given the legal limitations he faces.

Federal hate crimes law may not cover the killing even if it was motivated by hate. Federal criminal law has no specific, catchall charge for acts of domestic terrorism. Sessions may decide that the murder charges already leveled against James Alex Fields Jr. in state court are sufficient for justice.

“It’s my hope that with the degree of national and international scrutiny, that this department will do the right thing,” said Kristen Clarke, a former hate crimes prosecutor and president of the liberal Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. “This is a case that the world is watching.”

For Sessions, a genial 70-year-old with an Alabama drawl and an uncompromising conservative ideology, leading the Justice Department is the capstone of a decadeslong political career. He has faced questions about his treatment of minorities along the way.

As a federal prosecutor in the 1980s, Sessions charged black community activists, who were swiftly acquitted, in a voter fraud case that, along with allegations of racially charged comments, cost him a federal judgeship. As a Republican senator more than 20 years later, he opposed expanding the federal hate crimes statute to protect people based on their sexual orientation and gender identity.

Clarke said Sessions’ comments in the days after the Charlottesville attack made her cautiously optimistic, but his history has her concerned.

Sessions promised to “advance the investigation toward the most serious charges that can be brought, because this is an unequivocally unacceptable and evil attack that cannot be accepted in America.”

But he also acknowledged that deciding whether to bring federal charges won’t be quick or easy.

Hate crime cases are often challenging because the government must prove that a suspect was primarily motivated by hatred of the victims’ race or religion, as opposed to their political views. The Charlottesville case could be tricky. The victim, 32-year-old Heather Heyer, was white. That means investigators will have to prove Fields was targeting minorities when he plowed into the crowd, not just anti-racism protesters.

Prosecutors can argue that a suspect committed a crime not because of the race of the victim but because of the race of the people on whose behalf she was protesting, said William Yeomans, an American University law fellow and former high-ranking official in the Justice Department’s civil rights division. But that interpretation of the hate crimes law has rarely if ever been used, he said.

“It’s a challenge, but I don’t think it’s entirely impossible or shouldn’t be explored,” Yeomans said. “The real measure of (Sessions’) commitment and his success in this case will be the thoroughness of the investigation” even if the case remains in state court.

Fields already faces a long sentence if he is convicted in Virginia, so a federal charge could be seen as largely symbolic. Former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, for example, said she brought hate crimes charges in a massacre at a black church in South Carolina because that state has no hate-crimes law, and federal charges were needed to adequately address a motive rooted in racial hate.

The latest case is being investigated by career prosecutors and FBI agents, who will make recommendations to Sessions. The FBI would not describe the scope of the resources.

"It is ridiculous to claim that men with freckles would deserve the same protections under a hate crimes law as say, African-Americans or the LGBTQ community.

Buy Photo Letters to the editor (Photo: IndyStar)Buy Photo

In a Feb. 13 column, Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill argued against the need for a specific hate crimes law in our state. Among his arguments is that hate crimes are crimes of thought, and we don’t legislate thoughts in America; rather, we punish the crimes that occur if those thoughts should become actions. Rejecting the desire to more harshly punish those who commit such crimes in the name of hate and intimidation, Hill goes on to state that no group should be more entitled to protections under such a law than any other, because “we cannot condemn hateful conduct against some and ignore hateful conduct against others.” This argument is deeply flawed because, in criminal cases, thought — otherwise known as intent — absolutely is taken into account when determining charges and sentences. We know there’s a difference between planning a murder and accidentally killing someone in an auto accident, and our laws deal with this accordingly. Secondly, it is ridiculous to claim that men with freckles would deserve the same protections under a hate crimes law as say, African-Americans or the LGBTQ community. Again, our laws already establish certain groups (children, for example) as meriting special protection. Precedents have already been set for these laws in 45 other states and the District of Columbia. It’s time for Indiana to join the 21st Century.

Government must take climate change seriously

As headlines continue to be dominated by sensational tweets, government gridlock, and celebrity reckonings, it’s easy to lose focus on long-term issues that will have far greater impacts on society and culture. The future of our planet and species depends on what we do right now to solve the long-term problems presented by climate change, and it is everyone’s responsibility to ensure that steps are taken now, not later, to find and fund the solutions to these problems.



Unfortunately, after already slashing the EPA’s budget nearly in half during his first year in office, President Donald Trump just requested that Congress approve another massive cut to the agency tasked with protecting our environment. In response to a global commitment to cutting carbon emissions and developing new technologies, Trump undermined the will of the nation and of the world by withdrawing from the Paris Accord. Now, he wants to further put our money where his mouth is, and stifle research and innovation in one of the most important issues of our time.



As citizens, we need to put pressure on our representatives to ensure that our government is taking seriously the grave threats posed by climate change. While it may not be as enticing as the drama that we have come to expect from our current events, it is far more consequential, and should be handled accordingly. This budget measure is wrong, and should not be put in to action.

Child welfare policies must be a priority

I am writing in response to the article published on Feb. 5 regarding the rise in child abuse fatalities in Indiana and Texas.



It pains me to see the underreported and steadily rising number of child abuse fatalities. It’s even more painful to see how feebly we’ve responded. Reporting demographic data on victims can only do so much. We are making incomplete strides to uproot the problem at its source.



Judge Marilyn Moores highlights the tie between the opioid epidemic, parents avoiding intervention, and the fatality spike. Caseworkers feel they must “cut corners” due to low retention rates, but there is absolutely no place to do so when a human being is involved.



The first years of our lives arguably have the most developmental importance. Putting policy reform on hold means putting the children on hold. Thanks to the Congressional commission, we have the data — now, we need to go back to the drawing boards.



It is my sincerest hope that we will take our responsibilities as legislators, policymakers, and human beings seriously and save those who cannot save themselves.

"Weve all experienced social threats. And if we are honest, sometimes we are the ones who perpetrate them. Social identities are categories that we place ourselves in that are shared with others such as , , , and to name a few (Tajfel & Turner, 1986). People experience social identity threats when they are confronted with situations in which they perceive one or more of their social identities are attacked (Holmes, Whitman, Campbell, & Johnson, 2016). While the effects of some identity threats are fleeting, other times, the effects can be pernicious and long-lasting. For example, research shows that identity threats can result in performance decrements (Steele & Aronson, 1995), antisocial behavior (Aquino & Douglas, 2003), and in-group denigration (Luksyte, Avery, & Yeo, 2015; Marques, Yzerbyt, & Leyens, 1988; Roberson, Galvin, & Charles, 2008). While research has mainly examined the antecedents and outcomes of identity threats, until recently, few studies have examined how people actually respond to them. In her paper, Jennifer Petriglieri (2011) theorized six responses that people can have toward identity threats: derogation, concealment, positive distinctiveness, identity exit, meaning change, and importance change. Using her work as a starting point, our research uncovered three additional identity threat responses: constructive action, ignore, and seeking assistance.

Since the presidential election, several sources have indicated that hate crimes and hate speech have increased (Yan, Sgueglia, & Walker, 2016). This unfortunate occurrence would suggest that individuals are finding themselves having to respond more and more to social identity threats in their and in social settings. Below, I will elaborate on the nine most common ways people typically respond to social identity threats (Holmes et al., 2016; Petriglieri, 2011):

Derogation: An individual engages in derogation by criticizing or denouncing the attacker to mitigate the identity threat and discredit the attacker .

Concealment: A concealment threat response occurs when one tries to tone down or hide the threatened identity hoping that the reduced salience of the identity will the attacker to stop the identity threatening behavior .

Positive Distinctiveness: The most proactive of the identity-protection responses, positive distinctiveness, is when an individual attempts to change the attacker’s opinion of the threatened identity by arguing the virtues of the identity .

Identity Exit: This is the most challenging threat response to undertake as it requires an individual to discard completely one’s affiliation with the threatened identity.

Meaning Change: When using this threat response, threatened individuals cognitively shift their perception of what the identity means to them.

Importance Change: When using this threat response, individuals cognitively shift how important the identity is to them (Petriglieri, 2011).

Constructive Action: Constructive action is when an individual attempts to overcome an identity threat by engaging in what he or she perceives to be productive behavior, but does not address the threatened identity directly.

Ignore: Despite the fact that people realize social identity threats occur, our research highlighted systematically that some people choose to ignore them. For example, one participant in our study stated he “overheard a group of non-minority colleagues using that was lightly interspersed with offensive, racially based epithets.” The participant felt powerless to act as he stated, “Working as one of the few minorities in the company, there was nothing much I could do. Unfortunately, I, more or less, saw it as a ‘lose-lose’ proposition.” He revealed to us that soon afterwards, he left the company. We found 13 other cases where participants thought ignoring the identity threat was the most appropriate response they could engage in at that particular time. Interestingly, many of them admitted that they were a bit dissatisfied with themselves afterwards when they used this response tactic as they saw it as a “lost teaching moment.”

Seek Assistance: The final response tactic that we uncovered that people engaged in was to seek assistance from others, oftentimes someone in an authority position. In some cases, this response was chosen because the participant did not know exactly who initiated the identity threat, but in other cases, the victim could confront the initiator of the threat, but instead decided to bypass having direct interactions with them and went to someone else who might be able to assist them in dealing with the situation.

While our research revealed that our study participants identified coworkers/colleagues as the source of most of their experiences with social identity threats, interestingly, they also revealed that identity threats were perpetrated by family members, friends, and acquaintances. Unfortunately, more than half were possibly reoccurring threats whereas the remaining others were single occasion threats. Despite theory suggesting specifically that some identity threat responses should lead to maintenance or elimination of identity threats (Petriglieri, 2011), our research found that identity threats were roughly as likely to be maintained as eliminated in our sample of narratives. Furthermore, our findings suggest that most identity threat response tactics (with the exception of importance change and meaning change) are associated with both the maintenance and elimination of identity threats. As a result, the type of threat response tactic an individual uses to mitigate the identity threat does not seem to determine the outcome. Within our sample narratives, however, we found derogation and constructive action to mostly result in the threat being eliminated, while ignore usually resulted in the threat being maintained. Taken together, our findings suggest that identity threat responses and their outcomes are highly individualized phenomena that are strongly influenced by context-specific factors (Johns, 2006). As such, it is my advice to start with the different types of identity-protection threat responses and see which ones work best to eliminate identity threats in your particular situations.

"Bellingham, Washington, is usually thought of as a picturesque Northwest harbor town, but it was the setting of a huge anti-Sikh riot. Curtis Cronn / Flickr The 1907 episode in a seaside timber town in Washington came to be known as the Bellingham Riots. Really, though, there were no riots. There was a pogrom.

At the time, the U.S. was suffering through deep economic distress, a panic-filled recession that had begun the year before. Angry anti-immigrant sentiment was ascendant. And hundreds of Sikh men who had traveled from India to Bellingham to toil in the lumber mills paid the price.

Some 500 white men, many of them members of the local Asiatic Exclusion League, descended on the Sikhs and other South Asians, routing them from the bunkhouses where they roomed and chasing them into the streets. Within hours, the entire Sikh population of Bellingham had fled, frantically piling onto trains and boats in search of some sort of refuge. Many had been physically battered.

I knew nothing about this incident until I visited Washington state this spring and met with members of the Sikh community there. For them, it was easy to draw at least some parallels between that century-old ugliness and recent events. Immigrants were again being demonized. Lost jobs were fueling white working-class despair and resentment. Hate crimes were reported to be up. Yelling, Get out of my country! a gunman had shot two Indian software engineers in an Applebees restaurant in Kansas. Closer to home, in Kent, a suburb of Seattle, a man had shot a Sikh in an apparent hate crime.

A few weeks after the shooting, on a gray March day, I met Hira Singh Bhullar at a café in Kent. The shooting happened four or five blocks from here, he said, gesturing in the direction of the crime scene with his finger.

Bhullar, who works in the IT department at the Starbucks headquarters in Seattle, was shaken. Hed lived for a time in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He never felt entirely safe there, always worried that somebody would accost or attack him.

But Bhullar had never felt threatened in Washington. Sure, some racists had posted mean comments on his Facebook page when he ran for the Kent City Council. Still, he didnt take that kind of internet obnoxiousness too seriously. Now, though, things seemed different. He worried about what seemed to him to be a metastasizing meanness towards immigrants and members of minority religions.

Persecution is something Sikhs know well. Their faith began with the teachings of Guru Nanak, born to a peasant family in 1469 in the Punjab region of South Asia, an area that stretches from eastern Pakistan to the northwest edge of India. Nanaks message was decidedly oppositional, challenging the authority of the regions two dominant religions, Hinduism and Islam; some scholars compare Nanaks spiritual revolution to Christianitys protestant reformation, which was unfolding in Europe at the same time.

Equality — between man and woman, preacher and congregant, ruler and serf, high-born and the untouchable — was central to Nanaks theology. What has developed over the past 500 years is a monotheistic faith with a heavy emphasis on social justice. Sikh temples, or gurdwaras, make a point of feeding anyone who needs a meal.

Of course, not everyone appreciated his teachings. Early Sikh gurus, or prophets, were tortured to death by the regions rulers.

There are an estimated 500,000 Sikhs living in the U.S., many in New York and California. In recent years, Yuba City, California, a small city in the middle of the Sacramento Valley, has become a major hub for Sikhs — Yuba Citys annual Nagar Kirtan parade, a key holy event, draws as many as 150,000 people from around the world.

In the U.S., Sikhs are a frequent target for xenophobes and haters. They are often immigrants or the children of immigrants. They tend to have brown skin. And their garb and personal grooming practices set them apart. Following the directives of the gurus, observant male Sikhs do not cut their hair — ever — and many keep their locks covered by a turban whenever they leave the house. They also typically refrain from shaving, often growing robust beards.

Initially, the look was intended to distinguish Sikhs from the adherents of other religions. But in America, the bulk of the populace knows little to nothing about Sikhism, so they see a person with a turban and assume hes a Hindu or a Muslim.

For a multitude of reasons, there are no credible statistics regarding the number of hate crimes directed at Sikhs each year. But it is not hard to appreciate the very real fact of those crimes. Talk to a member of the faith. Theyll likely know of an incident. They for sure will know of their history of victimization. They might have a personal connection that explains the threat they feel at this moment.

I spent time with three of them in recent months. I also researched the life of the American man who murdered six Sikhs at a temple in Wisconsin. What follows are four profiles, stories of hurt and worry and resilience.

Chad Batka, special to ProPublica

Inderjit Singh Mukker probably works harder than you do. The 54-year-old wrenches himself out of bed while the world is still wrapped in darkness, at 3 a.m., for a few moments of prayer and meditation before he climbs into a sleek black sedan and starts driving. And driving.

Working as a limousine driver, Mukker typically logs 12 or more hours behind the steering wheel each day, navigating Chicagos cratered and traffic-clogged roadways. By the end of the week hell have spent at least 60 hours in the car.

This is not a good job at all. You are working, working, working, says Mukker, a slight man with oversized eyeglasses and a dark turban. During the course of our conversation, he speaks in clipped, punchy sentences, the remnants of his native Punjabi tinging his words. Im killing myself. My back hurts, my shoulder hurts. Its difficult, he notes, to get a healthy meal when youre trapped in traffic for half of your life.

Driving while wearing a turban can also be hazardous.

In 2010, two men assaulted a Sikh cab driver in West Sacramento, California, breaking an orbital bone in his face and fracturing a bone in his spinal column. The men, one of whom was eventually convicted of hate crimes charges, tauntingly called the victim Osama bin Laden as they punched him.

A similar crime occurred two years later in Washington, leaving a Sikh taxi driver hospitalized for more than a week with severe kidney injuries. According to a trial brief filed by prosecutors, the attacker, who was drunk, wrestled the driver to the ground and stomped on his stomach repeatedly. The 50-year-old victim began vomiting, possibly due to a concussion.

Motherfucker, what are you doing here? screamed the assailant. Why did you come to my country? The attacker, who pleaded guilty, told police he assaulted the driver because he is a towel head.

A New York City cabbie, Harkirat Singh, was battered earlier this year by a group of intoxicated passengers who punched him and tore his turban off his head. Ali Baba, fuck you! they shouted, according to the driver, who was an interviewed by a local newspaper.

Like so many immigrants in the livery business, Mukker once harbored dreams of doing something bigger, better. In India, he earned a masters degree in agronomy from Khalsa College and figured hed go on to a career in agribusiness. But then, in 1988, he moved to Chicago in hopes of improving his economic fortunes.

Equipped with only a rudimentary command of English when he stepped off the plane in the U.S., Mukker quickly discovered that his job prospects were extremely limited — the only gig he could find was driving. Since then its been cabs, Uber and now limos.

Mukker has tried other things. For a few years he ran a catering company specializing in Indian meals, but he eventually grew weary of it. Then there was the lawn care business. It was my own company called United Grass and Lawn Care Service. I had a good number of clients in high-end neighborhoods, he recalls.

But just as the business was starting to take off, Mukker decided to shutter it. This was after 9/11 and he was afraid that people would think he was a jihadi and assault him, or send the cops rushing to stop a potential terror incident by arresting him. His wife, a registered nurse, was worried as well.

At first, when he tells me this, Im baffled. I wonder if hes making some kind of joke I dont comprehend — how could anybody mistake a lawnmower for a weapon of mass destruction?

Mukker is patient with me. The lawnmower wasnt the problem, he explains. It was the chemicals. He was a swarthy man with an accent and a turban hauling around sizable quantities of fertilizer, pesticides and herbicides; ammonium nitrate, a common fertilizer, has been used as an explosive by guerrilla bomb makers since at least the 1970s. I was worried about my safety. It was tough out there, he says.

So he drove.

On a September evening in 2015, he was driving in a personal capacity, picking up food from an Indian grocery store near his home in Darien, Illinois, a comfortable suburb about 20 miles southwest of downtown Chicago.

Mukker was sitting in his Prius at a stoplight when a male teenager in another car started yelling at him. Bin Laden, screamed the young man, go back to your own country! When traffic started moving, the teen swerved and cut off Mukker, who stopped his car and rolled down the window.

He came out from the car and started punching me, recalls Mukker. He kept on punching me like he was doing boxing or something.

The blows broke his right cheekbone, damaged both of his eyes, and rendered him unconscious. When Mukker regained consciousness, his mind felt foggy. His eyesight was cloudy. In a photo taken at the hospital, a huge purple hematoma stretches across one cheek, a bandage is taped over the other. Blood is splattered all over his white shirt. The bruises healed after a month or two, but my vision took a long time to recover. I went to the eye doctor for three different appointments, he says.

Unable to see clearly, it would be six months before Mukker could return to driving full time. Depression set in. He fell behind on his bills and nearly lost his home to foreclosure. Members of the Sikh community took up donations to help out Mukker and his family, who were stuck with $4,890 in medical costs.

It could have been worse. Just ask Maan Singh Khalsa, a Sikh from Richmond, California, who was brutalized in a roadway altercation late last year. Khalsas ordeal started when a Ford F-150 full of oil refinery workers pulled up alongside him at a traffic light. One of the men in the truck hurled a beer can at Khalsa, a 41-year-old IT specialist. Harassment quickly turned to violence, with a pair of men beating Khalsa, yanking his turban from his head and hacking off his hair with a knife.

In the course of the attack, Khalsas teeth were knocked loose and his pinky was cut. Doctors had to amputate the injured finger after it developed a virulent infection.

Before the attack, I was so carefree. I considered myself an American like everyone else, he said during a court hearing in May. I had never worried about being the victim of prejudice. I enjoyed my life fully. Now fear had infected Khalsa. He had trouble leaving the house, found himself treating all strangers as potential aggressors.

Pleading guilty to aggravated assault and hate crimes charges, both assailants received three-year terms in state prison.

In Mukkers case, the teen, who was prosecuted as a juvenile, was sentenced to 200 hours of community service, monetary restitution — the monthly checks are going to repay Mukkers medical costs — and counseling.

I did not expect this would happen to me in my own backyard while I was driving my own private Prius, says Mukker. This kid, he pauses for a second, he was out of his mind.

Chad Batka, special to ProPublica

I first interviewed Mukker in his living room in Darien, as he sat beneath a large painting of the Guru Nanak, who founded Sikhism during the 15th century. The conversation was emotionally heavy, but for Mukker it was good day. He had just paid off all the debts that had accrued in the months after the crime, a milestone that gave him reason to smile.

Later I met with him again, hoping to ask a few more questions. This time his mood was gloomy.

A few days earlier, hed been driving a seven-seat SUV when he picked up a group of young women at a convention of medical professionals. Some of the women started smoking marijuana in the car. He shut that down.

Enraged, one of the women began slinging insults. Go back to your country, she snapped. This is not your country.

When we spoke, Mukker was still feeling dejected over the incident. He seemed tired. Tired of people calling him towel head or diaper head or terrorist. He was tired of people telling him he wasnt an American, even though hes a U.S. citizen and has lived in Illinois for more than half his life.

He said hed decided to take a different approach to his job. Mukker told me he would drive like a dead person.

By that he meant he wouldnt chat with his passengers or get upset when they verbally abused him. From now on hed smother all of his emotions, make himself as cold as a corpse.

Because insults and slurs cant hurt the already dead.",1
"PORTSMOUTH, RI—The high schools in Portsmouth and Middletown both received phoned-in bomb threat on Monday. In Portsmouth, school officials said that the threat was called in at around noon and students were evacuated while police conducted a sweep of the building, ultimately determining that the threat was a hoax. Students were back in class not long after. In Middletown, it was decided that the best course of action was for students and staff to remain in the building while school and police personnel cleared it, which occurred in a thorough and efficient manner, school officials said in a statement. Similar threats were also reported in Barrington and a slew of schools in Massachusetts on Monday. The threats come after a 16-year-old Newport boy was charged with 15 counts of making bomb threats. In most cases, the threats are delivered by a robotic voice from phone calls traced back to foreign countries. The calls are delivered with robocalling systems that are difficult to trace.",0

Study: Heart stents fail to ease pain

A procedure used to relieve chest pain in hundreds of thousands of heart patients each year is useless for many of them, researchers reported Wednesday. Their study focused on the insertion of stents — tiny wire cages — to open blocked arteries. The devices are lifesaving when used to open arteries in patients in the throes of a heart attack. But they are most often used in patients who have a blocked artery and chest pain that occurs, for example, walking up a hill or going up stairs. The new study, published in the Lancet, stunned leading cardiologists by countering decades of clinical experience. The findings raise questions about whether stents should be used so often — or at all — to treat chest pain. Dr. William E. Boden, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at Boston University School of Medicine, called the results unbelievable. Dr. David Maron, a cardiologist at Stanford University, praised the new study as very well conducted but said it left some questions unanswered. For the study, Dr. Justin E. Davies, a cardiologist at Imperial College London, and his colleagues recruited 200 patients with a profoundly blocked coronary artery and chest pain severe enough to limit physical activity, common reasons for inserting a stent. All were treated for six weeks with drugs to reduce the risk of a heart attack, like aspirin, a statin and a blood pressure drug, as well as medications that relieve chest pain by slowing the heart or opening blood vessels. Then the subjects had a procedure: a stent was inserted or wasnt. This is one of the few studies in cardiology in which a sham procedure was given to controls who were then compared to patients receiving the actual treatment. Those who didnt receive the stent but thought they did reported placebo effects.

Hartford student expelled, faces hate crime charges after harassing roommate

A woman was charged with criminal mischief and expelled from the University of Hartford after boasting about having contaminated her roommates toothbrush, face lotion and other belongings in an effort to drive her from the room. Brianna Brochu, 18, was in court Wednesday for charges that originated with an Instagram post in which she said she finally rid herself of her randomly assigned dorm roommate, Chennel Jazzy Rowe, whom she referred to as Jamaican Barbie. Brochu is white; Rowe is black. After one and a half months spitting in her coconut oil, putting moldy clam dip in her lotions, rubbing used tampons on her backpack, putting her toothbrush places where the sun doesnt shine, and so much more, I can finally say goodbye to Jamaican Barbie, said Brochus now-deleted post. Police requested Brochu be charged with intimidation based on bigotry or bias. The University of Hartford announced she was no longer a student and would not be returning. Acts of racism, bias, bullying, or other abusive behaviors will not be tolerated, university president Gregory Woodward said. Rowe, a freshman, described her roommates behavior in a Facebook video Monday, prompting the social media campaign #JusticeforJazzy, and accused the school of attempting to keep the episode quiet. I moved out because I felt like I was unwanted in my own room, she said, adding the revelations explained why she had been sick early in the school year. Other students in the dorm showed Rowe the social media posts made by Brochu.

Trump nominates Jerome Powell to be next Fed chairman

President Donald Trump on Thursday announced his choice of Federal Reserve board member Jerome Powell to be the next chairman of the nations central bank, succeeding Janet Yellen, the first woman to hold the position. Powell, 64, is seen as a safe pick whose selection will likely assure investors hoping for continuity. Some analysts see Powell, though, as more inclined than Yellen to ease financial regulations and possibly to favor a faster pace of rate increases. Trump says Powell had earned the respect and admiration of his colleagues in his five years on the Feds board. The president also called Yellen, whom he decided not to nominate for a second term, a wonderful woman who has done a terrific job. In a departure from previous announcements of new Fed chairs, Yellen was not in attendance Thursday.

Energy chief Perry: Fossil fuels can prevent sexual assault

Energy Secretary Rick Perry thinks using fossil fuels can help prevent sexual assault. On Thursday, Perry said using fossil fuels to power electricity can help villages in Africa and other developing regions. He said during a recent visit to Africa, a young girl told him electricity was important to her because she has to read by the light of a fire with noxious fumes. Speaking at an event sponsored by Axios and NBC News, Perry went further. He said electricity is important from the standpoint of sexual assault. When the lights are on, when you have light that shines the righteousness, if you will, on those types of acts. So from the standpoint of how you really affect peoples lives, fossil fuels ... play a role in that, Perry said. I happen to think its going to play a positive role. In response, the executive director of the Sierra Club, the nations largest environmental group, said: It was already clear that Rick Perry is unfit to lead the Department of Energy, but to suggest that fossil fuel development will decrease sexual assault is not only blatantly untrue, it is an inexcusable attempt to minimize a serious and pervasive issue. Michael Brune added that Perry should resign. Perrys office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Report: Most 2016 voting sites lacked full disability access

Fewer than one in five polling places were fully accessible to voters with physical disabilities during the 2016 general election, a government report shows — a finding that has prompted federal officials to recommend the Justice Department adopt stricter compliance rules. The report released Thursday by the non-partisan Government Accountability Office gives only a year to address problems before the 2018 elections. The bottom line is that accessibility for voters with disabilities has not kept pace with the increase in early voting since the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act and the 2002 Help America Vote Act. Both early voting and the disabilities access are top goals in making it easier to vote. Instead, President Donald Trump has urged action on unfounded allegations of voter fraud, and more than a dozen Republican-controlled states have enacted tighter restrictions on voting this decade. Just 17 percent of the 178 polling places officials examined nationwide were without any impediments to voters with disabilities, despite states reporting theyd taken adequate care before voting started.

Trumps accusers feel forgotten, but lawsuit may change that

While allegations of sexual misconduct against powerful men in recent weeks have drawn wide public support, women who came forward during the presidential race with accusations against Donald Trump said they have spent the past year feeling dismissed and forgotten. With Trump, it was all brushed under the rug, said Temple Taggart, who says Trump kissed her when she was competing in his Miss USA pageant in 1997. But that could change if a defamation lawsuit brought by a woman who accused the president of unwanted sexual advances is allowed to proceed in New Yorks Supreme Court. Lawyers sought a subpoena seeking all Trump campaign records related to his female accusers. Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice, is represented by the firm of Gloria Allred, who has helped bring cases against Bill Cosby and others. They say Trump defamed Zervos during the campaign when he repeatedly described her and other accusers accounts as lies and nonsense. During the campaign, more than 10 women made allegations against Trump ranging from unwanted touching to sexual assault. Most of them spoke out after the release of an Access Hollywood tape in which he bragged about sexual assault.

Aint seen McMuffin yet: Man pulls out gun at McDonalds

Police are looking for a man who pulled out a gun after being told by a McDonalds drive-thru worker there were no Egg McMuffin sandwiches available. The incident occurred shortly after 3:30 a.m. Wednesday at a McDonalds in Warren, police said. The worker told police that two men inside the car appeared to be around 20 years old. She said the driver called her a vulgar name after pulling out the gun and then cursed at her again before driving away. Warren police hope to identify the men using surveillance video footage.

Colorblind? States scenic viewfinders unveil fall hues

Even when the rugged expanses of the Great Smoky Mountains were bursting with their famous fall colors, they always looked dull black and tawny to Lauren Van Lew from the 3,590-foot-high perch of Mt. Harrison. The 20-year-old, who is colorblind, loves painting, but wife Molly has to help her pick and mix colors. Last week, however, Van Lew for the first time saw yellows, oranges and reds exploding across the mountains. Red was the biggest difference. I mean, I cant describe it, said Van Lew after looking through a special viewfinder. Its the most beautiful thing Ive ever seen in my life. The states colorblind viewfinder installed atop the Ober Gatlinburg resort was one of three in Tennessee that debuted Wednesday. The other two viewfinders are at scenic areas of Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area near Oneida, and at the westbound Interstate 26 overlook near Erwin in Unicoi County. Although the technology isnt new, state officials believe its the first time its been incorporated into a viewfinder, at a cost of $2,000 apiece, to help people with red-green color deficiencies. How crisply the viewfinders display the colors can vary among the 13 million or so Americans with color deficiencies. — tbt* wires",1
"Crews were dispatched to 413 Copper Square, a new residential development located across the street from Stony Hill Fire Department for reports of a fire in Unit 413. Crews responded at around 2:05 p.m. today. Chief Galliford was informed while en route that it was a unit under construction. According to the Stony Hill Fire Department, both Stony Hill and Bethel Fire Department were were dispatched to the location. Mutual aid response from Brookfield FD for additional manpower was requested prior to FD arrival, as this is a densely built three story townhouse complex, that can create challenges for firefighters, especially in a unit not completely built out with all the normal fire protection features, the fire department said. Upon arrival, a smoldering fire was found in the garage area. Stony Hill Fire Department Engine 3 and Bethel Fire Department Engine 6 quickly extinguished the fire and the damage was very minimal to the structure. All other units including Brookfield were cancelled en route and not needed on scene. Fire units remained on scene for about 45 minutes to extinguish the smoldering insulation and check for hotspots.

"What led to William Boucher a Chicago man going on a violent racist rant after having coffee spilt on him at a local Starbucks store?

William Boucher a 23 year old Chicago man has been arrested after inciting racial outcry along with punching and spitting at a 59 year old black man during an incident at a local Starbucks store.

Matters came to the fore Tuesday mid afternoon, after Boucher took offense to having coffee spilled on him at a Loop Starbucks. A report via ABC7Chicago told of the individual spilling coffee on Boucher being African American.

It was then that the Boucher was recorded on video (see below) going on a tirade, including calling people ‘disposable vermin’ and ‘shut up slave’.

The argument escalated when the dispute spilled outside. Boucher yelled racially charged language at a man before repeatedly punching him.

‘Get on all fours! Do not walk on those two legs! You don’t deserve to walk on two legs, vermin’ the man said on the video.

Another man approached Boucher as he walked away, with Boucher seen punching the 59-year-old man, knocking him onto the ground. Bystanders accosted Boucher after tackling and holding him down until police arrived.

The 59-year-old man was sent to Northwestern Memorial Hospital to be treated for an eye injury reported dnainfo.

Upon his arrest, Billy Boucher was charged with three misdemeanor counts of battery, accused of physically and verbally abusing three people. Some have since wondered why the man wasn’t charged with hate crimes and assault.

Following Boucher’s arrest, Starbucks employees said the suspect had been a problem customer in the past, but never violent.

A regard of Boucher’s Facebook page (since removed…) revealed references to God and his hopes of becoming a successful businessman. Several photos show him posing with diverse groups of people at events for entrepreneurs.

In one post, he comes to the defense of a Muslim woman wearing a hijab who was kicked out of a Donald Trump rally in January of 2016.

‘This is total bullying!’ he wrote. ‘Are any of you really voting for this kid? And I’d love to tell that woman in person how well she took that! I’d give her a high five!’

Yet to be necessarily understood is what informed Boucher’s abrupt and incendiary attitude towards black persons….and to what degree the man’s belief system reflected that of the community?

"MAHWAH, N.J. (CBSNewYork) — Tensions are heating up further in Mahwah, New Jersey over religious boundaries called eruvs.

As CBS2’s Erin Logan reported, more of them have been vandalized—and police are investigating it as a hate crime.

Six of the PVC pipes that mark the eruvs have been damaged in Mahwah. An eruv is a symbolic fence – a religious symbol for Orthodox Jews.

Police say seeing them in such a condition is considered a hate crime.

This is now the second hate crime investigation in a matter of weeks. The latest vandalism was reported Saturday in the area of East Crescent Avenue.

Adam Winarchik lives right at the scene.

“I don’t think people should be vandalizing things — that’s unfortunate that it’s happening,” he said. “I think there’s more of a constructive way to go about dealing with that issue. “

That issue has and continues to be over the eruvs, which are put in place so Orthodox Jews are able to carry things and push baby carriages on the Sabbath. The symbolic fence makes their entire community a Jewish backyard.

Some fear the eruv will attract more and more Orthodox Jews, ultimately taking over their community.

“I think it’s an encroachment. It should be a separation of church and state as is laid out in the Constitution,” Winarchik added. “As it being harmful, I don’t see it like that.”

Eruv expert Rabbi Adam Mintz told CBS2 he does not see any takeover or encroachment happening.

“There are over 200 eruvs in metropolitan areas in North America,” he said.

That’s including smaller towns like Monsey in neighboring Rockland County, New York.

But, many in Mahwah, including town officials feel the eruv markers violate local law that prohibits signs on trees rocks, and utility poles.

That is why the town unanimously decided to start issuing summonses if PVC pipes on utility poles outlining the eruv stay in place.

Now, the Bergen Rockland Eruv Association and two New York residents have filed a lawsuit just announced on Friday.

Mahwah Mayor Bill Laforet would not comment on the lawsuit, but he did say the vandalism will not be tolerated. He just announced a $1,000 reward for any information that will help lead to an arrest and conviction of the crime.",1
"OAKLAND, CA — A judge ordered Ghost Ship warehouse master tenant Derick Almena and creative director Max Harris to stand trial on 36 counts of involuntary manslaughter for their roles in a blaze at the warehouse last year that killed 36 people. At the end of a preliminary hearing Thursday for Almena, 47, and Harris, 28, which lasted six days, Alameda County Superior Court Judge Jeffrey Horner said the fire during a music party at the warehouse at 1305 31st Ave. in Oaklands Fruitvale district the night of Dec. 2, 2016, was an unspeakable tragedy. Horner said testimony at the tense hearing, which was guarded by five bailiffs, indicated that the warehouse, where about 25 people lived even though it didnt have a permit for residential use and was cluttered with artwork, woodwork, RVs, trailers and other items, was a death trap. Horner said the question is who was responsible for the dangerous conditions at the warehouse, which also was known as the Satya Yuga Collective, and he concluded, There is very strong evidence it was the responsibility of these two defendants (Almena and Harris). The judge said, They both had integral and substantial roles in the management of the premises. Horner said, There is sufficient cause to believe that both defendants are legally responsible for what happened that night and the deaths of 36 people. The six defense attorneys who represent Almena and Harris made much of the fact that investigators from the Oakland Fire Department and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were never able to conclusively determine the cause of the fire, although an Oakland fire official said she believes it likely was caused by some type of an electrical problem. Tony Serra, one of Almenas lawyers, argued before Horner issued his ruling, If you dont know what the cause was you cant establish negligence. Tyler Smith, one of Harris attorneys, said, You cant rule out arson, spontaneous combustion or the possibility that it was an accident like someone knocking over a candle or incense. Smith said it could also be argued that many of the deaths were caused by a woman who a witness testified was wearing a red beanie and a green dress and repeatedly screamed, This is the will of the spirits of the forests and urged people who were on the buildings second floor to stay there for their own safety, since the fire was downstairs. Smith said that womans screams may be the reason many victims wound up trapped on the second floor. He said, Maybe they heard her. Prosecutor Autrey James said he believes Almena and Harris were criminally negligent because they allowed people who lived at the warehouse to accumulate flammable chemicals and wood that was stacked to the ceiling. James also said Almena and Harris oversaw the construction of an illegal second set of stairs at the building and the drilling of a 25-foot hole that he said opened an air draft that allowed smoke to spread quickly to the second floor during the fire and cause the deaths of 36 people. In addition, James said the building didnt have emergency lighting, sprinklers and fire alarms. But Serra said, The premises was not a fire trap. It was mystical, overwhelming, spiritual, ascetic, social and a community of artists and people of integrity who were not related to commerciality, greed or financial gain. Serra argued that the buildings owner, Chor Ng, who returned to China after the fire, had primary responsibility and also alleged that the Oakland Fire Department knew about the conditions at the warehouse but didnt take any action and is far more culpable than my client (Almena). After the hearing, Serra said he had expected that Horner would order Almena and Harris to stand trial but he thinks a jury will see this case a little bit differently and might not convict the two men. Curtis Briggs, one of Harris attorneys, said, Were extremely encouraged because we saw the District Attorneys evidence and their evidence against Max Harris was minimal.

"PEPPERELL, MA — A Pepperell man was revived Saturday with the help of a chest compression machine, officials said. The 67-year-old man, who was found in cardiac arrest, was administered the LUCAS 3 chest compression machine. It was the first time Pepperell firefighters used the machine, officials said. The man was expected to make a full recovery. (Sign up for free daily newsletters and breaking news alerts from Massachusetts Patch sites.) The rescue happened on Hollis Street Saturday morning. Officers found the man in cardiac arrest at his home, with his son performing chest compressions. First responders administered a defibrillator and the LUCAS machine, which performs automated compressions. First responders can become fatigued while doing compressions, officials said. The town recently purchased the machine with a Nashoba Valley Health Fund grant from the Community Foundation of North Central Massachusetts and the Greater Lowell Community Foundation. This is the first time we used our new Lucas machine, and it performed above and beyond our expectations, Pepperell emergency medical technician Melissa Schrader said in a statement. The patient showed promising signs of recovery prior to leaving his home and was talking to the ambulance crew prior to arriving at the hospital. Photo: The LUCAS 3 chest compressor.

"An Oregon State University student charged with a hate crime still holds a position in student government. But a recall vote is underway, that ends Friday night. KLCC’s Brian Bull reports.

Andrew Oswalt is accused of placing racist stickers on the cars of activists last June. He’s also a representative of the Associated Students of OSU. If two-thirds of student voters approve his recall, Oswalt will lose his seat.

Lauren Sluss is editor of the campus newspaper, The Barometer. Her latest editorial asks students to act on their values…noting that just 12 percent of the student body voted last election. She sees the recall vote as more a referendum on racism on campus, noting a truck with anti-Semitic and racist signs has shown up supporting Oswalt this week.

“At first it was a little disheartening to see people who have very oppressive, exclusive views and values, Sluss tells KLCC.

To counter though, it’s been very cool to witness so many people who stand very opposed to these beliefs and will take action and let their voices be heard, and let people know who have exclusionary views that they will not be tolerated on campus.”

Oswalt is also running for re-election. He remains free on bond and has been allowed back on campus since his arraignment.

"Six former Hopkins priests are on a list of priests credibly accused of sexual abuse of minors in the archdiocese (of St. Paul and Minneapolis), according to the archdioceses newspaper. The priests on the list are: The Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis published the list of 34 priests Thursday in the online edition of The Catholic Spirit, the newspaper that serves the archdiocese. About half of the parishes in the archdiocese—92 out of 188 parishes—had one of the priests on the list there at some point, according to the archdiocese. The publication was made in response to ongoing lawsuits against priests and the church arising from childhood sexual abuse cases. The archdiocese and Diocese of Winona originally sought to seal the list—which was created in 2004 and included 33 of the 34 priests named today, according to the Star Tribune. The courts agreed to seal the list in 2009. But Archbishop John Nienstedt reversed course after the church was accused of shielding priests—allegations that gained extra fuel in recent months from a Minnesota Public Radio exposé. The information being released comes mostly from reported incidents that occurred between the mid-1950s and 1980s, according to The Catholic Spirit. All have been permanently removed from ministry or are deceased, the article said.

"Richard Collins III Wrongly Murdered Before His Graduation

Things were going well for 23-year-old Richard Collins III, he had just been Commission as a lieutenant in the United States Army and set to graduate from Bowie State on Tuesday.

Richard was stabbed to death early Saturday, May 20. While waiting for an uber on the campus of The University of Maryland. The suspect is a 22-year-old Maryland student who belongs to a racist Facebook group, and Collins’ death is being investigated as a hate crime. Sean Urbanski, 22, the Maryland student suspected of killing Collins, has been charged with first and second-degree murder and first-degree assault.

Urbanski is a member of a white supremacist Facebook group called Alt-Reich Nation, they’re anti Jew, Latino, African-American and immigrants. On Sunday, University of Maryland police chief David Mitchell announced that the FBI had been called in to assist in the investigation. According to witnesses, at about 3 a.m. on Saturday, Collins and two other students were waiting for a Uber outside of a dormitory when Urbanski approached them. It seemed random and unprovoked. Police say that Urbanski also appeared intoxicated.

“Step left, step left if you know what’s best for you,” Urbanski said, according to charging documents written by the police. When Collins refused, Urbanski stabbed him once in the chest, police allege.

Initially, Urbanski was charged with murder, but charges may be upgraded to a hate crime because of his affiliation with a racist organization.

BY ERIKA NORTONMore than a year after the Temple Beth Shalom cemetery in Warwick was decorated with anti-Semitic graffiti, an 18-year-old Warwick resident was arraigned Tuesday, Oct. 31, in Orange County Court on charges stemming from the investigation into the vandalism.The day before, an Orange County Grand Jury indicted Eric Carbanaro, 18, with fifth-degree conspiracy as a hate crime, and two counts of tampering with physical evidence, all felonies. He surrendered himself on the indictment warrant Tuesday morning, according to court records, and was arraigned later that day.Carbonaro’s attorney, James Pawliczek, entered a not-guilty plea.The graffiti was discovered in the early morning hours of Oct. 9, 2016, and included black spray-painted Swastikas, “Heil Hitler,” and lightning-shaped “SS” insignias of the Nazi military police covering the Jewish cemetery walls near the intersection of Spanktown Road and Union Corners Road.The State Police and the Town of Warwick Police Department have been investigating the damage ever since.According to the indictment, Orange County prosecutors allege that Carbanaro took part in a conspiracy to damage property at the cemetery by spray-painting the anti-Semitic symbols and messages. The indictment also alleges that Carbanaro acted in concert with others to destroy evidence of vandalism by deleting images and other information pertaining to desecration of the cemetery contained on cellphones belonging to two other co-conspirators.Between Oct. 9, 2016, and June 19, 2017, the indictment alleges one of the co-conspirators deleted a “meme” that read “secretly spray paints Jewish cemetery and gets away with it” while at Carbanaro’s residence.“There is no room for this type of hateful desecration of religious property here in Orange County,” said District Attorney David Hoovler in a statement. “These anti-Semitic symbols and messages do not reflect the values of the overwhelming majority of Orange County and Warwick residents.“Those who engage in hate crimes will be thoroughly investigated and prosecuted by my office,” Hoovler continued. “I thank the New York State Police and the Town of Warwick Police Department for all of the resources that they have devoted to this investigation.”This is the first arrest in the vandalism case, and the investigation will continue, according to Hoovler.In response to the arrest, the leadership and membership of Temple Beth Shalom released a statement thanking the local law enforcement and government officials for seeking justice for the hate crime.“We live in an ethnically diverse county and it’s of great comfort and knowledge to know and witness first-hand that our law enforcement bodies, county officials and DA’s office are working tirelessly and seamlessly on behalf of all its residents to ensure not only the safety, security and sanctity of our Jewish communal organizations, but for not tolerating any form of hate, bigotry and racism towards any group of people and/or minority that live within the beauty of Orange County,” the statement said.“Speaking out against hate, injustice, bigotry and racism are constant themes within the spiritual mission and values of the congregants and members of Temple Beth Shalom,” the statement continued. “These have been long standing traditions within our synagogue since its inception over 70 years ago. On behalf of our leadership, membership and countless souls whose memories, we the living are obligated to protect preserve and cherish, we say with love in our hearts thank you to the unsung countless public servants of this county. Thank you for protecting us daily, enforcing the laws of our communities ensuring the safety of all its citizens.”The Jewish Federation of Greater Orange County also released a statement thanking the Orange County District Attorney’s Office and local and state law enforcement. It also highlighted the need for education in the face of rising anti-Semitic incidents within the county and across the state.In the first quarter of 2017, there have been a total of 97 anti-Jewish incidents logged across the state according to an the Anti-Defamation League report, a 70 percent increase from the first quarter of 2016.And while the total number of incidents across the state in 2016 essentially remained constant at 199, instances of anti-Jewish vandalism rose by 50 percent. Anti-Semitic incidents spiked 86 percent nationwide so far in 2017.“This hateful act highlights the need for education in Orange County,” the statement said. “The Jewish Federation recently launched an initiative to combat local anti-Semitism and to sponsor programs that raise awareness of the scourge of anti-Semitism and that promote tolerance.”The federation has developed a multi-pronged strategy and is working closely with the Warwick Valley School District to roll out a series of programs and initiatives in 2017/18 that will raise awareness of these issues, promote discussion and understanding and transform school cultures.The activities will include professional development trainings for educators, school assemblies and the creation of a Stop Hate media campaign.",1

"FORT MYERS, Fla. -- As loved ones prepare to lay to rest two Florida police officers killed in the line of duty, a lawmaker is pushing for new protections for those in uniform across our state.

This bill, if passed, would increase the penalties for anyone who kills a police officer.

Senator Rene Garcia from Hialeah is the bill’s sponsor. If passed, killing a police officer would become a hate crime. Charges would go from a first degree misdemeanor to third degree felony.

Under Florida law, a hate crime is any crime committed by one person against another person or their property based on their personal characteristics.

Heres a list of different characteristics included under hate crimes:

· Race/color

· Gender/gender identity

· Religion

· Ethnicity/ancestry/national origin

· Sexual orientation

· Advanced age

· Mental/physical disability

· Homeless status

If the bill passes, expect to see law enforcement officers and emergency service employees included on this list.",1
"“Your forms of politics has led your country to a shithole state, but this is America and we will not stand for you muslims[sic] bastard,” read the letter.

The Council on American–Islamic Relations (CAIR), an organization that monitors and combats Islamophobia, recently shared a photo of a hateful pro-Trump leaflet targeting the Muslim community in Minnesota. The letter is being seen as a potential hate-crime and a threat to the American-Muslims living in the area.

The letter, which features President Donald Trump’s name along with his campaign slogan “Make American Great Again,” informed the “immigrant-s***s” the “neighborhood infidels” will not tolerate any “infiltration” from “sharia loving Muslims.”

Sharia is an Islamic law subjected to the ways of the Quran and Hadith (the teachings of the Prophet). However, with the rise in terrorism in the name of a radical Islam, sharia law has sparked a global debate.

The disturbing letter also called Muslims “barbaric,” “bastards” and even referred to them as “shithole,” mimicking the president’s alleged reference to Haiti and African nations.

“Clearly, your forms of politics has led your country to a shithole state, but this is America and we will not stand for you muslims[sic] bastard,” read the leaflet.

The letter not only threatened the Muslims of Minnesota, it also said they were being observed and that the author would “take necessary steps” to defend their country

The leaflet seemed to be in line with the controversial Facebook post by Minnesota Republicans Cindy Pugh, Kathy Lohmer and Dave Sina, who recently warned of Muslims “infiltrating” their precinct caucuses.

The post sparked a widespread outrage and has since been deleted, but it clearly had an affect on some bigots.

The now-deleted post was reportedly created by Sina, the chairman of Fourth Congressional District GOP, who claimed a friend of his had attended a caucus training session held at a mosque by the Muslim American Society (MAS), according to Star Tribune.

The accusations were proved false when a Facebook Live video recording of the training session came to light. It clearly showed the Muslims were not conspiring against the U.S. but were attending a workshop that demonstrated how the caucuses work and how to get chosen to be a delegate at the parties’ state conventions. It also taught how important it was for the American-Muslim community to get involved in the politics.

Responding to the post, Minnesota GOP Chairwoman Jennifer Carnahan said Muslim-Americans are welcome to caucus with the Republicans and that “there is no religious test to participate in the Republican caucus.”

Sina’s message, however, was already grasped by the public. While most of them stood with the American-Muslim community, it is also important to realize the amount of damage it caused.

"BRANDON, FL — Gary Lynn Durham died as he lived. In an ironic twist of fate, the man killed in a Wednesday morning road rage-related shooting had been convicted in a similar crime in 2002. Durham, 40, was killed after a traffic-related dispute turned violent, the Hillsborough County Sheriffs Office said. It was around 6:30 a.m. when Durham and Robert Padgett, 42, pulled over on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. Exactly what happened to prompt Durham to stop in the middle the road and get out of his Mazda pickup remains unclear. What is clear, the sheriffs office said, is that Durham and Padgett argued. As the dispute escalated, Padgett fired at least one round from a handgun. The shot hit and killed Durham, the sheriffs office said. Padgett, authorities said, called 911 and tried to save the man he just shot. He administered CPR, but the effort failed. Durham was pronounced dead at the scene. As detectives began their investigation into the death, they uncovered Durhams checkered past. The Brandon man had a lengthy history of convictions and incarcerations in the Florida state prison system. His first sentencing came in November 1994 following convictions on such charges as aggravated assault and grand theft. He was also sentenced in 1995 on a string of charges incurred the year prior related to grand theft and trafficking in stolen property, prison records show. Durhams most recent conviction involved an October 2001 manslaughter charge related to the death of Tim Gibbs, 48. The two men were involved in a road rage incident, deputies say. Durham threw a punch that resulted in Gibbs death a few days later. Durham was ultimately charged with manslaughter and convicted. He was sentenced to serve 11 years, eight months and 13 days on Sept. 30, 2002. Durham was released from prison in September 2012. He avoided further brushes with the law in Hillsborough County until his death on Wednesday, records show. Durhams death remains under investigation. Authorities have not charged Padgett in the shooting, saying the case has been turned over to the State Attorneys Office for review. As authorities continue to unravel the details that led up to Durhams death, Gibbs widow told the Tampa Bay Times shes glad she no longer has to worry about bumping into him. Its a shame that he didnt learn his lesson while in jail, Nancy Gibbs told the Times. Its ironic that he died in the same way as my husband.

"Jewish Federation’s Executive Director Tapped by Governor Baker for Task Force on Hate Crimes

PITTSFIELD — Dara Kaufman, executive director of the Jewish Federation of the Berkshires has been appointed to Gov. Charlie Baker’s new Task Force on Hate Crimes.

The Governor signed an executive order re-establishing the Governor’s Task Force on Hate Crimes on Nov. 6. Its purpose is to advise the governor on issues relating to the prevalence, deterrence, and prevention of hate crimes in Massachusetts and the support of victims of hate crimes.

“I am very honored to be appointed by Governor Baker,” says Kaufman. “The Jewish Federation has consistently worked to raise awareness and speak out against all forms of prejudice and bigotry. When an incident of hate happens, it impacts all of us. With all that is happening in our country at this time, this is really important work for us to be focusing on.”

Of the 17 appointees, Kaufman is the only task force member from Berkshire County. A member of Congregation Knesset Israel in Pittsfield, she has been executive director of the Berkshire Federation for the past four years.

“Our administration is committed to making Massachusetts a safe and welcoming place with zero tolerance for hate or violence,” said Governor Baker. “We look forward to working with this diverse group of qualified members who represent different backgrounds and parts of our state to enhance our commitment to inclusive and tolerant communities.”

Other appointees include Robert Trestan, executive director of the Anti-Defamation League, New England Regional Office; Dr. Robert E. Johnson, Chancellor of University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth; Dr. Nawal Nour, director of Ambulatory Obstetrics at Brigham and Women’s Hospital; Yusufi S. Vali, executive director of Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center; and Deborah Williams, a student at Amherst College.

Members of the task force represent a group diverse in gender, race, industry, region, age and education. Secretary of Public Safety and Security Daniel Bennett and CEO and President of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Boston Josh Kraft will serve as co-chairs.

The task force will promote full and effective coordination among law enforcement agencies in order to improve prevention, investigation, and prosecution of hate crimes.

The Task Force will encourage and assist agencies in safe reporting of hate crimes pursuant to the Hate Crime Reporting Act, as well as analyze and publicize hate crime reports pursuant to the Hate Crime Penalties Act. This group will develop best practices related to technical assistance for school districts that may seek to incorporate hate crime education into their curricula. A formal written report will be submitted to the Governor annually.

Governor Bill Weld initiated the Governor’s Task Force on Hate Crimes in 1991, and from 1994 to 1996 the task force led the successful legislative effort to amend the Hate Crimes Penalties Act to expand its scope and increase penalties for those who commit hate crimes. The reconstitution of the Task Force is intended to reinvigorate the Commonwealth’s statewide commitment to fighting hate crimes and supporting victims and impacted communities.",1
"Between 5,000 and 7,000 hate crime incidents are reported each year to the FBI. This is how a hate crime is defined and how federal and state authorities prosecute them. (Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post)

An abaya-wearing Muslim teenager on her way home from a mosque was beaten to death with a metal bat before her body was found dumped in a pond. Her Sunday morning killing is being investigated as an extreme case of road rage — but not as a hate crime.

A day earlier, three teenagers in Boston were accused of beating a street musician who dressed in a bear costume and played a keytar. They removed the black man’s mask, slammed his face into the ground while yelling racial slurs, then ran off with his money. After the boys were arrested, the district attorney’s office said it is investigating whether they should face hate crime charges.

The legal system’s differing reactions to the attacks on Nabra Hassanen and the unidentified performer near Faneuil Hall spotlight the sometimes fuzzy line between what is a hate crime and what is not.

In general, federal and state hate crime statutes punish people who commit crimes based on a victim’s race, ethnicity, religion or other specified categories.

From there, the laws across the nation can be varied and murky.

[‘Every person deserves to rest in peace’: American Muslims raising money to repair vandalized Jewish cemetery]

For some clarity, The Washington Post spoke with Jack Levin, co-director of Northeastern University’s Brudnick Center on Violence and Conflict, and a sociology and criminology professor who’s published several books on hate crimes.

His answers have been edited for brevity.

What determines whether something is prosecuted as a hate crime?

We have very stringent guidelines about defining what is a hate crime. We have to get into the head of the perpetrator and get at his intentions. And so the evidence in most hate crimes consists of what a defendant says at the crime scene or the graffiti that he may leave there.

So if he voices a racial slur, then it’s much more likely that the offense will be tried as a hate crime regardless of what that offense may be.

[Officials: 17-year-old Muslim girl assaulted and killed after leaving Virginia mosque]

Does that legal standard make it harder to prosecute?

Not all hate mongers are stupid. Many of them do leave evidence at the crime scene, but many others don’t — and so they’re never charged with a hate offense.

There are also plenty of victims who simply will not report hate crimes. They may be immigrants, maybe illegal immigrants who may fear being deported. They may come from some country where the police are part of some tyrannical regime. Or they may be African Americans who historically have had a bad relationship with police going back decades.

What happens to someone who is arrested for a hate crime?

Very few hate crimes are ever prosecuted. (The number of hate crimes committed) is vastly underestimated. But even when someone is arrested, the chances are very slim that it will go to court and that when it does, there will be a conviction based on the hate crime statute.

… For (convicted) adults, it’s almost always an enhancement penalty — tacking on some time in prison during the sentencing phases. But for first offenders, it could be probation with teeth. It could be probation with community service or victim restitution.

Why do states and the federal government have hate crime laws on the books?

Hate crimes send a message from the perpetrator about the victim and the victim’s group. It’s not just against the primary victim, it’s against everybody in that victim’s group.

… And that’s why hate crimes are important — whether they deter a particular offense or not. It says that Americans do care about the people in that group and welcome them into the community.

Historically, what has precipitated increases in hate crimes in the United States?

The number of hate crimes escalates as a result of a perceived threat being made by some outside group. A threat to income, culture, religion or even survival.

After 9/11, there was an incredible, dramatic increase in hate crimes against Muslims and Arabs. … And then in 2003 and 2004, hate crimes against gays and lesbians rose as a result of Massachusetts passing the first gay marriage law. Then after a few months, the number of hate crimes subsided.

And then when Obama was elected the first time, in 2008, hate crimes against African Americans skyrocketed. There were some horrific crimes that were committed by white supremacists across the country.

Every time there’s a threatening incident, it happens. In 2010, hate crimes against Latinos rose. So did the number of immigrants in the country at a time when the unemployment rate was really high.

Critics claim that President Trump’s rhetoric, especially against immigrants, has resulted in an uptick in hate crimes. Can the president have an impact?

The rhetoric has become a triggering event. It’s socially acceptable now. We used to talk about political correctness in a positive way. Now politically incorrect speech is just being nasty to people. We have a First Amendment and it makes it lawful to be nasty. But there’s a limit.

It’s a shame that more Americans don’t have a grasp of the history. They talk about immigrants who don’t speak English, who live on government handouts. But they forget the same (discrimination) was evident in the 1920s, when Italians and Jews came over. It’s unfortunate that the same people whose ancestors were the victims of hate attacks in other generations now do the same thing.

"0 Man accused of writing racist note, setting store on fire to face judge

CHARLOTTE, N.C. - The man police said is seen in surveillance video setting an east Charlotte store on fire will face a judge for the first time Tuesday.

Charlotte authorities arrested 32-year-old Curtis Flournoy on Sunday in what theyve described as a racially tinged arson attack on an immigrant-owned store specializing in goods from the Indian subcontinent.

Flournoy is accused of arson and committing a hate crime at Central Market on Albemarle Road Thursday night, and is charged with burning a building of trade, malicious damage by use of an incendiary material, felony breaking and entering, ethnic intimidation and anonymous or threatening letters.

Channel 9 obtained exclusive surveillance video that appears to show Flourney at an east Charlotte store. Police said the man in the video left a racist note, broke a window at the business and then set a fire.

A note was left at the scene near the door, according to police. The writer of the note said he or she did not want any refugee business owners in the area and threatened to torture the owner if the owner did not leave and go back to where he came from, police said.

The owner of the store, Kamal Dhimal, is a refugee from Bhutan, according to officials.

The person signed the letter, “White America.”

Dhimal said his heart sank when he got to the store and saw the note.

There is no word to express how I am feeling, Dhimal said.

The Indian and Nepali market has been a staple in east Charlotte for years, but Dhimal said it doesnt feel like home after Thursday nights incident.

It makes me scared for the refugee and immigration, Dhimal said.

But he said he is not deterred by the hatred, and his stores doors are open to everyone.

We are stronger, if they are stronger, they will come in the daytime, Dhimal said

Surveillance video showed a black man who is about 5 feet, 8 inches tall, weighing 200 pounds, with a short Afro and a goatee, according to officers.

Channel 9 found out that Flournoy has been arrested several times. Hes been convicted on a child abuse charge in 2013, and then on a drug charge in 2015.

A judge placed him on probation both times.

"TRUMBULL, CT—A homeowner was issued a summons after police busted a suspected underage drinking party on Churchill Road. Police responded to an anonymous tip Aug. 15. An officer spotted three males in a vehicle near the party and questioned them. They indicated they were going to a nearby party. Two of the males had alcoholic beverages and one had marijuana that was thrown out of the vehicle, police said. The officer took all of their licenses and as he was heading toward the party the vehicle took off, according to police. Youths scattered as the officer approached the residence. Inside officers observed alcohol containers and beer pong tables. Police made contact with the homeowner, identified as Jose Ochoa, 54. He was issued a misdemeanor summons for second-degree breach of peace and permitting minors to possess alcohol. The initial officer still had the licenses of the three males that took off. The license of William Newbauer, 18, of Milford appeared to be fraudulent, according to police. Police were able to make contact with the males thanks to some help from Fairfield Police. Newbauer was charged with second-degree forgery, possession of marijuana and interfering with police. A Fairfield 18-year-old who was in the vehicle was charged with interfering with police and possession of alcohol by a minor. Another teen was cited for possession of alcohol by a minor.",0

If Virginia authorities have their way, the anti-Muslim hate that set the stage for the murder of a young woman will go unchallenged, writes Elizabeth Schulte .

SEVENTEEN-YEAR-old Nabra Hassanen was returning with a group of friends for all-night prayers at the All Dulles Area Muslim Society center in Sterling, Virginia, in the early-morning hours of June 18 when she crossed paths with Darwin Martinez Torres.

The 22-year-old Martinez Torres reportedly drove up on the group of teens, chased them, attacked Nabra, who was wearing an abaya, with a metal baseball bat, and put her in his car afterward. Nabras body was found in a pond later that evening, beaten to death.

Taking all these details into consideration, Fairfax County police concluded that the reason for Torres attack was...road rage.

Nabras family and friends, however, see her abduction and murder in a clearer light. This is a hate crime, her father, Mahmoud Hassanen, told reporters the day after the murder. Its racism. Getting killed because shes Muslim.

The Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) is calling for an investigation. Wed like to hear from the witnesses to the initial attack as to whether they heard any biased statements, said Ibrahim Hooper of CAIR. Even if not, why is this individual targeting a group of people dressed in Muslim attire? Would they have been targeted if they hadnt been of a certain faith or ethnicity?

Nabra Hassanen

Hundreds who joined a protest in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday to show their solidarity with Nabra echoed this sentiment.

The police are saying the murder was because of road rage. Why as a Muslim do I find that hard to believe? said Dr. Maha Hilal. Since 9/11, Muslims have been systematically targeted and discriminated against by the U.S. government. While that has been more obvious under the Trump administration, it is nothing new.

NABRAS FAMILY has good reason to suspect she was targeted because she was Muslim. According to a 2017 CAIR Civil Rights report, from 2014 to 2016, anti-Muslim bias incidents jumped 65 percent--and in the same period, hate crimes targeting Muslims went up 584 percent.

These incidents have only increased since Donald Trump took the White House, where he has reinforced every bigoted anti-Muslim idea in society--not only with rhetoric, but with action, like attempting to ban citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S.

But while skyrocketing anti-Muslim attacks are staring law enforcement officials in the face, they wont take them seriously, preferring instead to focus on what they consider to be the real threat--Muslims themselves.

The media is an eager accomplice in this, too, according to a study from Georgia State University.

When the perpetrator is Muslim, you can expect that attack to receive about four and a half times more media coverage than if the perpetrator was not Muslim, researcher Eric Kearns told NPR. In other words, a perpetrator who is not Muslim would have to kill on average about seven more people to receive the same amount of coverage as a perpetrator whos Muslim.

This media bias contributes to the toxic climate of Islamophobia--but by whipping up fear and hysteria, it helps create an atmosphere where more attacks are possible.

NPR cited another study from the University of Michigan in which people were shown video clips with different portrayals of Muslims. Those who watched news stories portraying Muslims as terrorists were more likely to support unconstitutional policies against Muslim Americans.

Hate crimes committed against Muslims expose the ugly double standard about what is taken seriously as terrorism and what is not.

In London, just after midnight on Monday morning, a white man driving a van plowed into a crowd of Muslim worshippers as they stood talking outside a mosque in the Finsbury Park area. One man was killed and at least 10 more injured in the attack by a man whose neighbors acknowledged that he was racist toward Muslims.

In this case, British officials called the atrocity what it was--terrorism--which is a rare occurrence. But that didnt prevent the victims of terrorism, as even the right-wing media acknowledged from becoming the target of suspicion.

For a long time, Finsbury Park was synonymous with two things: Arsenal Football Club and the radical, hook-handed cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri, wrote Newsweek, referring to a man who is serving life without parole in a U.S. jail on terrorism charges and hasnt been affiliated with the mosque for about 13 years.

Newsweek and the rest of the media were less quick to point out these more recent facts: Last summer, the mosque was one of several that was sent envelopes containing white powder, including one that had p*** filth written on it. And in 2015, an arsonist threw a petrol bomb over its gates.

IF GOVERNMENT officials took a fraction of the resources they use spying on Muslims and looking for terrorists, and instead committed it to protecting Muslims now under increased attack, we might not be mourning these victims in Virginia and London.

Some 20,000 people in Britain are on a terror watch list almost exclusively made up of people who are young and traveled to Syria, according to a report by the BBC.

Its at least a small recognition of reality that this weeks terrible attack in Finsbury Park is being called terrorism. But just naming this kind of violence properly wont stop the wave of attacks directed at Muslims.

To find the accomplices responsible for these terrorist attacks, Donald Trump and Theresa May need look no further than their mirrors.

The hate and fear they use to scapegoat and demonize Islam--all to divert attention from their own crimes and bolster their war on terror around the globe--puts a target on the backs of Muslims, at home and around the world.

And it is political leaders like Trump and May who have provided a breeding ground for the far right to grow and become more emboldened. This week, while members of a London mosque gathered donations for victims of the Grenfell Towers fire, a few members of the far-right Britain First organization protested outside to spread their filth, saying, Theyre all Muslim terrorists.

What we really need is a war on Islamophobia. But that isnt going to come from political leaders. It will need to be built by people standing up to hate and discrimination wherever it rears its head--in the airports under Trumps racist ban, in demands for justice for victims of hate crimes, and in counterprotests against the right.

"The Justice Department today announced that a federal jury in Victoria, Texas, has returned guilty verdicts on all counts as charged related to the 2017 burning of a local mosque. Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, U.S. Attorney Ryan Patrick, Special Agent in Charge Fred Milanowski of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and Special Agent in Charge Perrye K. Turner of the FBI made the announcement.

The jury found Marq Vincent Perez, 26, of Victoria, guilty for a hate crime in the burning of the Victoria Islamic Center on Jan. 28, 2017, and for use of a fire to commit a felony. In addition, they found he possessed an unregistered destructive device for an incident that occurred on Jan. 15, 2017.

“All people are entitled to live free from violence and fear, regardless of their religion or place of worship,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore of the Civil Rights Division. “Perez’s actions were criminal, unlawful, and dangerous. This Justice Department is committed to holding hate crimes perpetrators accountable under the law.”

“This case represents the great coordination and cooperation of many federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies,” said U.S. Attorney Ryan Patrick. “The Department of Justice is committed to protecting the religious liberty of all people and their ability to practice their faith without being the target of this kind of dangerous activity.”

“Houses of worship are scared places in America,” said ATF Special Agent in Charge Fred Milanowski. “We are pleased in the outcome of this investigation, and ATF will continue to aggressively investigate all House of worship fires.”

“Hate crimes are not only an attack on a specific victim, they threaten the cornerstone of diversity that America was built upon,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Perrye K. Turner. “Perpetrators of hate crimes, like Perez, aim to chip away at our nation’s foundations by instilling fear into entire communities with violence.”

The jury heard from a total of 19 government witnesses, including law enforcement officers, experts, and others who testified about communications with Perez, one of whom detailed how Perez called Muslims “towelheads.” An FBI agent took the stand and described hate-filled messages found on Perez’s Facebook account.

Testimony in court detailed how Perez planned the event and revealed how he had done “recon” of the mosque in the days leading up to the fire. A witness who was with Perez on the night of the fire described how excited Perez was upon seeing the mosque in flames, explaining that he was “jumping up and down like a little kid.”

Additional evidence presented in court revealed that items taken during two burglaries at the mosque were found at his home, and also an improvised bomb similar to what was used in an attempted car-bombing approximately two weeks prior to the fire.

The jury also heard from an arson expert who concluded the fire was the result of an “intentional application of an open flame.”

The jury found Perez guilty on all counts as charged and deliberated for approximately three hours following a five-day trial.

Perez faces up to 20 years in federal prison for the hate crime and up to 10 years for possessing an unregistered destructive device. For use of a fire to commit a felony, the penalty is a consecutive and mandatory minimum of 10 years in prison. All of the counts also carry a potential $250,000 fine. Sentencing has been set for October 2.

ATF and FBI conducted the investigation along with the City of Victoria Fire Marshal’s Office, Victoria Fire Department, Victoria Police Department, Texas Department of Public Safety - Criminal Investigations Division and Texas Rangers with assistance of Texas State Fire Marshal’s Office and sheriff’s offices in Victoria and Nueces Counties.

Assistant U.S. Attorneys Khandelwal and Kate Suh are prosecuting the case along with Trial Attorney Saeed Mody of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division.",1

"Hate crimes targeting mosques and other Muslim places of worship across the UK more than doubled between 2016 and 2017, a Press Association investigation has found.

Police forces recorded 110 hate crimes directed at mosques between March and July this year, up from just 47 over the same period in 2016.

Racist abuse and threats to “bomb the mosque” feature heavily among the hate crimes, as do incidents of offenders smashing windows on buildings and parked cars.

(PA Graphics)

Other records include offensive graffiti sprayed on to buildings, violent assaults on worshippers, two cases of arson and two cases of individuals leaving bacon on door handles at mosques.

Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott called the figures “deeply troubling”.

“Attacks on any religious group or minority are abominable,” she said, adding: “These anti-Muslim attacks will be condemned by all decent people.”

The data was obtained by the Press Association through Freedom of Information requests to UK police forces. The figures, based on 42 responses from 45 forces, also show:

:: 25 forces saw a year-on-year increase in hate crimes directed at mosques, with the biggest rise reported by Greater Manchester Police (nine crimes, up from zero) and London’s Metropolitan Police (17 crimes, up from eight).

:: Threats, harassment or other intimidating behaviour more than tripled, from 14 crimes in 2016 to 49 in 2017.

:: Violent crime against individuals more than doubled from five recorded crimes against worshippers at mosques in 2016 to 11 crimes in 2017.

:: Crimes recorded as vandalism or criminal damage increased from 12 in 2016 to 15 in 2017.

Due to differences in how police forces record their statistics and the fact that not all forces are included in the figures, the true number of hate crimes directed at mosques is likely to be higher still (Dominic Lipinski/PA)

Britain endured a number of terror attacks claimed by Islamic State over the period in which the crimes were recorded, at London Bridge, Westminster and Manchester.

The figures come to light within weeks of separate incidents in which an imam and surgeon who treated Manchester bombing victims was stabbed outside a mosque in Cheshire and a 14-year-old boy was stabbed multiple times in the face and neck outside a mosque in Birmingham.

Other high-profile cases of hate crime at mosques this year include the Finsbury Park terror attack in June, a Manchester mosque gutted by fire in an arson attack in July and the sending of a white powder and bomb threats to three mosques across London in July.

More than 50 places of worship, almost half of them mosques, applied for the most recent round of anti-hate crime funding from the Government, which ended in June.

Applications for funding, intended to provide security measures, were made available to all places of worship in April and May but extended into June after terror attacks at the start of the summer.

Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott (Lauren Hurley/PA)

Ms Abbott called on the Home Office to publish data on hate crimes against all places of worship “as a matter of course” after “worrying reports of attacks on synagogues as well as mosques”.

She said: “Politicians have a particular responsibility in the language they use, the policies they advocate and the climate they create.

“There should be a unanimous message that violence against any section of our society is unacceptable.”

A Home Office spokesman said: “All forms of hate crime are completely unacceptable and the UK has some of the strongest laws in the world to tackle it.”",1

One of the leading human rights organization Amnesty International India has launched a website on Thursday which will be used to document the hate crimes in India.

Known by the name of “Halt the Hate“, the interactive website – which the Amnesty refers to as microsite – documents alleged hate crimes against Dalits, Adivasis, members of racial or religious minority groups, transgenders, and other marginalized communities that are reported in various Hindi and English newspapers.

Aakar Patel, Executive Director, Amnesty International India, said, “The first step to ensuring justice and ending impunity for hate crimes – where people are targeted because of their membership of a particular group – is to highlight their occurrence.”

He further said, “Our website aims to draw attention to some of these crimes by tracking and documenting them. Many of these incidents are deeply disturbing: Dalits have been attacked for merely sporting mustaches, and Muslims lynched for transporting cattle. Dalit women have been branded as witches and raped and killed.”

‘Halt the Hate’ documents alleged hate crimes in India starting from 28 September 2015, when Mohammad Akhlaq, a Muslim resident of Dadri, Uttar Pradesh, was murdered in his home by a mob claiming that he had eaten beef. Since then, media reports have begun to increasingly report instances of alleged hate crimes.

Thus far, “Halt the Hate” has documented about 44 hate crimes against Dalits, and 141 against Dalits in the year 2017. It also alleged to record 69 incidents of killing where 146 people lost their lives.

The Uttar Pradesh came up as the leading Indian state in terms of hate crimes recorded. Alone in UP, 237 hate crimes were recorded in the year of 2016.

“The data on our website is just a snapshot of alleged hate crimes in India. Many incidents are not reported in the media. While criminal investigations have been initiated in some cases, too many have gone unpunished. Authorities need to do much more to ensure justice for victims and their families,” Patel said.

Amnesty International India has also tried to reach out to individuals by providing ‘report a hate crime’ on the website where it allows users to inform regarding such hate crimes.

Patel further said, “The police need to take steps to unmask any potentially discriminatory motive in a crime, and political leaders must be more vocal in denouncing such violence.”",1
"Authorities appealed for patience Monday from two college communities reacting in shock, fear and anger after Sean Urbanski, a white University of Maryland student, was arrested in what police called the unprovoked stabbing of black Bowie State University student Richard Collins III. (U.S. Army via AP)

By JESSICA GRESKO and BRIAN WITTE, Associated Press

COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) — Authorities appealed for patience from two college communities reacting in shock, fear and anger after a white University of Maryland student was arrested in what police called the unprovoked stabbing of a black Bowie State University student.

Police and the FBI said they are investigating the killing of Richard Collins III as a possible hate crime, because the suspect, Sean Urbanski, became a member of a racist Facebook group several months ago.

Collins classmates at Bowie State organized a vigil in his memory Monday night.

I know people are hurting, Police Chief Hank Stawinski said. I know that people are drawing conclusions. I know that social media moves in its own way.

But Im asking as the Chief of Police in Prince Georges County ... that we take pause and allow all these investigators to do their work. They will know to a certainty what lies behind this, but were not there yet.

Authorities said Urbanski, who was denied bond Monday at his first court hearing, was intoxicated during the slaying early Saturday. Police are awaiting results of drug tests.

Defense attorney William C. Brennan argued that since the 22-year-old had no criminal record, he should be allowed to live at home with a GPS monitor and receive alcohol abuse treatment while his case goes forward. The judge declined, for now.

Collins, 23, who was visiting friends at the College Park campus, had just been commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army and would have graduated Tuesday from Bowie State.

Lt. Col. Joel Thomas, who runs the ROTC unit at Bowie State, described Collins as intelligent, athletic, personable and with all the makings of an outstanding military leader.

Richard cared deeply about his friends, cared deeply about others and he was exactly what we are looking for when were selecting officers for the United States Army, Thomas said.

The killing roiled both campuses, which are near each other in the Maryland suburbs of the nations capital. Bowie State, a historically black school, holds its commencement Tuesday in the same stadium on the College Park campus where Maryland held its ceremony Sunday.

If Im a person of color, I would certainly look at this as something that could happen to me. In fact, I know on Facebook our students are saying that, University of Maryland Police Chief David Mitchell said.

Gordon Johnson, who runs the FBI office in Baltimore, answered Mitchells call for help investigating the stabbing as a possible hate crime after authorities learned that Urbanski was added to the Alt-Reich: Nation Facebook group by an administrator in February.

The group, which was taken down after the stabbing, had about 1,100 members and included racist, sexist and anti-Semitic photos and posts. Police said Sunday that they hadnt found any posts from Urbanski in the group.

If the evidence leads us to conclude this was a hate crime, then we will have no hesitation whatsoever handling it as such, Prince Georges County States Attorney Angela Alsobrooks said at a news conference.

She said she understands peoples concerns, but its too early to draw conclusions, and prosecutors need something probably more than a Facebook post.

Officials said Collins was with two friends waiting for an Uber ride at about 3 a.m. when they heard Urbanski screaming and watched him approach.

Urbanski said Step left, step left if you know whats best for you, according to the charging documents. Collins said no, and Urbanski stabbed him once in the chest, the documents say.

Officers found Urbanski sitting on a bench about 50 feet from where Collins collapsed, with a knife in his front right pocket, the documents say.

Urbanski appeared for Mondays hearing from jail via a television feed. The judge said his bond request could be revisited later. His lawyer and parents left without commenting. A message left at his home number in Severna Park was not immediately returned.

A 2013 graduate of Severna Park High School, Urbanski made the honor roll in 11th grade, according to media reports. Urbanski was not scheduled to graduate from the University of Maryland this year, police said.

Zach Lessner, who was in a bowling league with him, said he didnt expect Urbanski would be the person to commit this horrendous act.

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said in a statement on Facebook Monday that the person responsible must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

Violence and hatred have no place in our communities and will never be tolerated, he said.

"Authorities in Washington state are searching for the driver of a pickup truck involved in a hit-and run collision that left one man dead and another hospitalized over the Memorial Day weekend.

Both victims are members of the Quinault Indian Nation, which issued a statement on Monday saying the men could be victims of a hate crime.

“If it is, in fact, determined that this was a hate crime it will add even more distress and sadness to our loss of this outstanding young man and the injury of the other.” Quinault tribal President Fawn Sharp said in the statement obtained by The Seattle Times.

The incident took place around 1:30 a.m. Saturday at the Donkey Creek Campground near Hoquiam. Witnesses told police a man driving a white, lifted, late-90s Chevrolet pickup truck pulled up near the camping area and began spinning his tires. A confrontation between the driver and campers ensued, at which time the driver allegedly backed up toward the campers, running over the two men.

q13foxcom Jimmy Smith-Kramer, 20, of Taholah, died after he was struck by a hit-and-run driver.

Killed was 20-year-old Jimmy Smith-Kramer, of Taholah. He was at the campground as part of a celebration of his 20th birthday, according to the Times story. The second victim, 19-year-old Harvey Anderson of Aberdeen, was hospitalized.

The Quinault Nation statement said witnesses reported hearing the driver scream “racial slurs and war whoops” when he ran over the men.

But Grays Harbor Undersheriff David Pimentel on Monday told The Associated Press that while investigators believe the driver intentionally struck the two men, law officers have no evidence suggesting a hate crime. Witnesses interviewed by police did not report hearing racial slurs, Pimentel said.

The sheriff’s office did not return a call for comment from HuffPost on Tuesday.

Upon his release from the hospital on Sunday, Anderson told Seattle’s Q13 News that Smith-Kramer jumped on top of him before the truck struck them.

“We both got ran over, but he saved me from taking a full-on collision,” Anderson said.

Grays Harbor Sheriffs Office The Grays Harbor County Sheriffs Office said the suspect vehicle is similar to the one pictured in this photo.

Investigators only have a vague description of the driver, whom witnesses described as a white male in his mid-30s with dark hair and a cropped beard. A female passenger, whom witnesses said screamed at the driver to stop, is also described as white and in her 30s.

Family members said Smith-Kramer was a hard-working fisherman and father of twin children.

“Jimmy was always a keen hunter and most of all … a friend, a family member and a father whose life was taken from him senselessly.” Larry Ralston, whose daughter had raised Smith-Kramer during most of his childhood, told The Native News Online.

"Sean Christopher Urbanski, the white University of Maryland student who is accused of stabbing and killing black Bowie State student Richard Collins III on May 20, has been indicted on charges in the crime and will be heading to trial, but he will not be facing hate crime charges.

Urbanski, 22, is charged with killing the 22-year-old Collins just three days before Collins was set to graduate from his historically black college, and officials told NBC Washington that video of the attack, which police say was unprovoked, was instrumental in getting the indictment.

Although the FBI and local police investigated the killing as a possible hate crime, Prince George’s County State’s Attorney Angela Alsobrooks said at a news conference Thursday afternoon that prosecutors were not able to bring hate crime charges against Urbanski.

“We didn’t have enough today,” Alsobrooks said.

Although Urbanski was found to be a member of a Facebook group called “Alt-Reich Nation,” where members posted hateful things about black people and other groups, Alsobrooks said it’s often difficult to build a hate crime case.

“Developing a motive is always a challenging aspect of a case. In this case, and in any other case, you can’t get it wrong,” she said.

NBC notes that the investigation into the case is ongoing, and it is possible that a hate crime could still be charged in the future if evidence is found to support it.

In the meantime, prosecutors are seeking a life-without-parole sentence on the murder charges against Urbanski.

It’s unfortunate that this will not be prosecuted as a hate crime because we all know that’s exactly what it was. The way prosecutors have to tap-dance around the law just to get any type of justice is sickening.



Let’s pray that we get a conviction when Urbanski goes to trial.

A woman and her teenage grandchild were critically injured Monday in a house fire in unincorporated East Compton that also killed two dogs.

Firefighters described encountering heavy smoke and fire when they arrived in the 16000 block of Essey Avenue about 12:45 a.m., said Los Angeles County Fire Department Dispatch Supervisor Miguel Ornelas.

The flames were extinguished in about 15 minutes and the cause was under investigation.

The two patients were taken to a trauma center for treatment of smoke inhalation. They were listed in critical condition, according to the sheriff’s department, which sent detectives to the scene to assist in the investigation.

According to ABC7, the injured were a woman and her 17-year-old granddaughter, who is transitioning to become male, and the family is wondering if the fire was a hate crime.

The teen is a senior at Dominguez High School, and plays drums in the school’s marching band, Channel 7 reported.

“When I heard about it, I just started crying,” said Donte Andrews, who also plays drums in the school band. “She is amazing. We’re very close. We became a family on the drum line.”

"Hate crimes rose by more than 42 percent in Montgomery County last year, with 21 incidents occurring at schools and colleges.

WASHINGTON — A newly released report out of Montgomery County shows that nearly half of hate-based vandalism reported last year happened at school.

The annual report shows of the 94 hate crimes that year, 38 were religious in nature, while race was the factor in 34, ethnicity in 12, sexual orientation in six and gender in four.

Concerning educators and parents, the incidence of hate crimes rose by more than 42 percent in the county last year, with 21 incidents occurring at schools and colleges. Eleven of the targets were high schools, two at middle schools, six at elementary schools and two incidents at Montgomery College, the report said.

In-class projects like the video below titled “The Lie” — made by a fourth-grade Gaithersburg, Maryland, teacher and her students — are among efforts to promote inclusion. The annual bias report released this week shows a spike in religious and racially based hate crimes at school buildings around the election in November and December 2016.

“Thirty-four percent of the incidents reported in 2016 occurred in November and December, following a political season that seemed to embolden people in the way they expressed themselves, and prompted the Maryland attorney general to set up a hotline in mid-November for people to report bias crimes,” the report said.

The report finds 45 percent of the vandalism incidents in the county happened at schools, “frequently involving the drawing of swastikas,” it said. The report found seven of the victims involved in the 94 hate crimes reported to county police in 2016 were under the age of 18.

"ALBANY, NY — A push to ban sex between police officers and people they arrest got support from Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday. Cuomo said he plans to include a provision classifying such sexual encounters as inherently nonconsensual in his state budget legislation. State law currently says prison inmates cannot legally consent to sex with correction officers or parole officers, but that law doesnt apply explicitly to police officers and people in their custody. There must be zero tolerance for sexual abuse and harassment across the board, and especially among those in positions of authority, Cuomo, a Democrat, said in a statement. This common sense reform closes an egregious loophole and helps protect against abuse in our justice system. City and state lawmakers have pushed for such a law since a then-18-year-old woman from Brooklyn accused two NYPD cops, Richard Hall and Eddie Martins, of raping her while she was handcuffed in a police van in September. Hall and Martins are facing criminal charges, but argue the sex was consensual. Legislators and advocates argue the power dynamics between cops and civilians — especially when theyre under arrest — preclude real consent in such cases. NYPD policy prohibits having sex on duty but its not technically illegal. The state Assembly unanimously passed a bill Feb. 5 that would make it a felony for a cop to have sex with a person whos been detained, arrested or otherwise in police custody. The bill is now under consideration in the state Senate. In this particular instance its something thats so clear that needs to be done that its not surprising that it passed unanimously, Assemblyman Edward Braunstein (D-Queens) told NY1s Capital Tonight on Monday. City Councilman Mark Treyger has proposed a local law that would make the same crime a misdemeanor in New York City. (Lead image: Photo by BravoKiloVideo via Shutterstock)",0

"Attorney General Jeff Sessions is sending a Justice Department federal hate crimes lawyer to help prosecute the murder of a transgender teenager in Iowa, according to a report Sunday.

It is unusual for the Justice Department to involve its lawyers in a local case, signifying the importance of the case to Sessions.

Sessions has been criticized by civil rights advocates for rolling back protections for transgender people.

This is just one example of the attorney generals commitment to enforcing the laws enacted by Congress and to protecting the civil rights of all individuals, said Devin OMalley, a spokesman for the Justice Department, in a statement to the New York Times.

The Iowa case involves a 16-year-old student in Burlington, Kedarie Johnson, who was shot to death in March 2016. Family and friends told local newspapers that he was gay and identified as both male and female. The New York Times said Sessions assigned Christopher Perras, a Justice Department lawyer, as a county prosecutor in the case.

Sessions since becoming attorney general has said transgender people are not protected under federal law from discrimination in the workplace. He reversed an Obama administration policy encouraging schools to allow transgender students to use a bathroom according to the gender they identify with.

But he has also condemned hate crimes, the Times noted. He publicly supported a case brought in the final weeks of the Obama administration in which a Mississippi man was sentenced to 49 years in prison for killing a transgender woman, the first U.S. federal prosecution of a hate crime based on gender identity.

Under federal law, it is a crime to attack someone based on gender identity.

Hate crimes are violent crimes, Sessions said in a June speech. No person should have to fear being violently attacked because of who they are, what they believe, or how they worship.

Sessions has taken a hard line on crimes against transgender people.

In March, six House members asked Sessions in a letter to investigate seven cases involving killings of transgender black women.

Sessions ordered civil rights prosecutors and the FBI to review each of the cases and contacted local authorities to offer assistance, the Times said.",1
"BERKELEY, CA — A homeless Hispanic man was charged Thursday with assault with a deadly weapon and a hate crime enhancement for alleging attacking an Asian-American man with a rock in downtown Berkeley on Tuesday morning, prosecutors and police said.

Jeffrey Pachingger, 38, voluntarily came to the Berkeley Police Department after the alleged attack at the bike racks at Shattuck Avenue and Center Street at about 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday and admitted to hitting the victim with a rock because of an illegal Asian takeover, Officer Jason Muniz wrote in a probable cause statement.

When he was interviewed after being notified of his rights, Pachingger admitted to willfully trying to kill the victim because of his ethnicity and his belief of an Asian takeover, Muniz said.

Police spokesman Officer Byron White said the victim returned to the bike racks at Shattuck Avenue and Center Street and bent over to unlock his bike when a suspect, later identified as Pachingger, struck him from

behind in the back of his head with a large rock.

Muniz said the victim felt dizzy and thought he was going to lose consciousness and ran north on Shattuck Avenue because he thought Pachingger would hit him again.

The victim was transported to a hospital to be treated for a head injury, White said.

The violent attack was at least the second by a homeless person in downtown Berkeley in less than a week, as on June 13 a homeless man punched a police officer and gave her a concussion when she tried to help him at the corner of Allston Way and Shattuck Avenue.

Muniz said he arrested Pachingger on suspicion of attempted murder and commission of a hate crime because hitting the victim in the back of his head with a rock could have caused death or serious bodily injury and because he admitted that he hit the victim with a rock because he was trying to kill him.

Pachingger also admitted that his malice toward the victim was due to the victims ethnicity, Muniz wrote.

However, the Alameda County District Attorneys Office decided to charge Pachingger with assault with a deadly weapon instead of attempted murder.

In addition, it charged him with battery with serious bodily injury.

Pachingger, whos being held at the Berkeley Jail in lieu of $130,000 bail, was arraigned today and is scheduled to return to court on Friday to possibly enter a plea.

"ESSEX COUNTY, NJ — Newark police arrested two males for allegedly robbing a 43-year-old Somerset man on Sunday in a vehicle carjacked out of East Orange, authorities said. According to the Newark Department of Public Safety, the Somerset resident told officers that a group of men robbed him around 4 p.m. after he exited his car on North Munn Avenue. He told officers that the men fled the scene in a gray Hyundai, which police later learned was reported carjacked out of East Orange. Authorities said that officers from the 1st and 4th Precinct located the Hyundai near Georgia King Village. In addition, officers also found one of the robbery suspects, Trevon McCoy, 19, who was walking inside of the complex with two other males.

"A Bellevue detective is under internal review upon facing recent allegations that he ignored a hate crime in January.

Bellevue Police Chief Steve Mylett confirmed Detective Jim Lindquist is under investigation for the claim.

Lindquist is alleged to have let a hate crime slip by as he only stood and watched as Robert Panera, a 53-year-old white, homeless man, yelled racist profanities at several black people, who were waiting for the bus one January day. Panera, now facing one charge of malicious harassment for the incident, is also alleged to have lunged at a black man as he hid behind Lindquist.

According to King County Superior Court charging documents, police were first dispatched to the Downtown Bellevue Transit Center at 2:31 p.m. on Jan. 23. Panera had called police to report he and others were involved in a disturbance.

Two officers arrived and contacted Lindquist, who was off-duty flagging at an intersection at the time. He identified the people involved, pointing out one black man, but he had already boarded a bus.

Those officers filed a police report but at the time, were not able to develop probable cause for a crime.

Later that day, charging documents state the black man, who had boarded a bus as police arrived, called the police station upset.

The man was “very angry” but finally told a police captain what happened.

The man was waiting for a bus when he saw Panera and an older black man get into a “disturbance.” The man took out his phone to record the situation and then saw Panera call 911, claiming he was being attacked.

But that wasn’t true, he said.

“Panera turned his attention to [the man recording] and began to yell at him,” charging documents state. “[The man] attempted to walk away from Panera but Panera followed him around the transit center.”

Panera threatened to “f***” the man up and called him the N-word several times, the documents continue.

The black man walked to the east side of the transit center and approached Lindquist, asking for help.

As Panera continued to taunt the man and others with racist epithets, the man apparently tried to hide behind Lindquist as Panera lunged at him.

According to the victim, Lindquist didn’t contact or detain Panera. When the victim left on the bus, he said he did so because he felt unsafe.

The man shared four videos with the police captain. Police also obtained the 911 recording, dispatch records, a traffic camera footage of the incident and two witness statements corroborating the incident.

Washington state law defines malicious harassment as an injury, damage or threat to someone because of “his or her perception of the victim’s race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or mental, physical, or sensory handicap.”

Mylett said officers in uniform are duty-bound to protect people, their property and to serve the public.

“If the officer is found to have engaged in misconduct, I will use the disciplinary process to modify and correct his behavior,” Mylett said, noting the allegations they have are unsubstantiated at this time. “The disciplinary process is very wide, I have a lot of options to modify and correct behavior.”

Mylett said if an employee is found to have engaged in misconduct, he will look at the intent behind the action or inaction first.

“If the intent is to harm somebody or to defraud, integrity issues, I’ll take that into consideration,” he said. “If there’s no such intent and it was by mistake or an accident, I’ll also take that into consideration as well.”

If Lindquist, who has been with the department for 30-plus years, is found to have done nothing wrong, Mylett said he will be exonerated. The chief estimates he’ll have the internal investigation case on his desk by the end of the month.

“Over the last three years, we’ve been in the business of building bridges into minority communities, into all communities, in Bellevue whose foundation is built on trust,” Mylett said. “We as the police department guard that very closely because we know it takes a long time to establish and build trust and all it takes is one incident to lose it or, at minimum, to set you back, so what is being alleged is inconsistent with the work we’ve been doing over the last several years.”

Mylett also pointed out that the police department did investigate Panera’s alleged crime, which was forwarded to King County prosecutors, who charged him March 23.

There is currently a $25,000 warrant for Panera’s arrest.",1
"PALM SPRINGS, CA – Two men were hospitalized in a Monday morning crash off of Highway 111 when one of them apparently lost control of a stolen truck he was driving, the California Highway Patrol reports. The driver was ejected from the vehicle, which had been reported stolen. His passenger was also injured. According to CHP Officer Mike Radford, the wreck was reported at 5:40 a.m. on the southbound side of Highway 111, south of Overture Drive, and involved a 1997 Ford Ranger. For unknown reasons, [the driver] allowed the vehicle to travel off the right side of the roadway, Radford said in a news release. The driver of the Ford lost control of the vehicle, it overturned and he was ejected. The driver, whose name was not immediately released, was taken to Desert Regional Medical Center with major injuries. Due to the severity of his injuries, he was not immediately taken into custody, Radford said. The passenger, 19-year-old Justin Harper of Cabazon, suffered moderate injuries and was also hospitalized, he said. While the collision was being investigated, the owner of the Ford reported that it had been stolen, Radford added. It is unknown whether alcohol or drugs were a factor in the crash. Neither man was wearing a seatbelt when the truck overturned, according to Radford.

… urinating in public and other such “quality of life” offenses. Which is to say they diminish quality of life — but not enough, in the eyes of Denver’s City Council, to warrant sending someone packing to his native land over a violation.

Denverite’s Erica Meltzer reports the changes represent a sweeping sentencing reform of the city’s criminal code by Denver’s political leadership. One reason for the move, backed by the City Council and Mayor Michael Hancock, was to lower trip wires sending homeless people to jail. Another aim (more attuned to the news cycle) is to make it harder for federal authorities to roust foreign-born residents, here legally, amid the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration. Meltzer explains that lighter sentences translate to a lower risk of deportation:

The maximum sentence for a crime is a factor in deportation proceedings. Legal non-citizen residents convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” with a maximum sentence of 365 days or more can be deported, even if they are sentenced to much less than the maximum. Having one of these offenses on their record can also affect the ability of visa holders to obtain residency. Reducing the maximum sentence to 364 days instead of 365 gives immigrants a defense against deportation: that the crime was a mere petty offense.

Is Denver again veering into “sanctuary city” territory? Not necessarily. As Meltzer also explains:

This change probably won’t do much to protect unauthorized immigrants who get caught by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Their presence in the country makes them potentially deportable, regardless of any criminal activity. It could help legal immigrants — green card holders and visa holders — avoid deportation for relatively minor offenses and could preserve their opportunity to apply for residency later.

At the same time, the reform includes a crackdown on on hate crimes. In unanimously adopting the revised sentences on Monday, the council reserved a category for more serious offenses, including municipal-level hate crimes (distinct from state law on the subject).

Meltzer quotes Scott Levin of the Anti-Defamation League, who addressed the council:

“Bias-motivated crimes are message crimes. … It’s not just targeting a victim. It’s targeting an entire community and telling them that people who look like them, who act like them, are not welcome.”

There’s a lot more to this story; you’ll get it all by reading Meltzer’s full report in Denverite.",1
"MILFORD, CT — A New Haven man was arrested after leading police on a high-speed chase with a stolen car through several communities beginning in Milford, police say. Police arrested and charged Emilio Davila, 22, Monday on charges of third degree larceny, reckless driving, engaging police in a pursuit, operation of a vehicle without a license, interfering with an officer and reckless endangerment. He was held on $25,000 bond at the time of arrest. An Milford officer was conducting laser traffic enforcement when he clocked Davilas vehicle at 90 miles per hour. Upon seeing police, Davila picked up speed to 106 miles per hour to get away from the officer, police say. At exit 49 on the Merritt Parkway, police unsuccessfully deployed spike strips in an effort to stop the Honda Civic, and Davila continued to exit the Merritt Parkway onto exit 48 heading South on Main Street near the Trumbull Mall, according to the police report. Davila again attempted to elude police, and took a left turn onto Oxford Street in Bridgeport and stopped at a dead end, police say. While in custody of State Police, Davila accused of stealing the tan Honda Civic in Middletown four days earlier.

"JOLIET, IL - Aaron Scofield was born and raised in Joliet. He graduated from Joliet West in 2005, later he attended Joliet Junior College. He liked his job as a warehouse technician for the Amazon facility in Joliet off Briggs Street. During the overnight hours of Thursday, Jan. 18, he finished early. Scofield drove from Amazon to the Walmart on Jefferson Street to buy groceries. Around 3:45 a.m., he pumped gas for his 2011 KIA Soul at the nearby Thorntons station. Then he got back on Interstate 80 at Larkin Avenue. He crossed the Des Plaines River and continued east on I-80 back toward his home in Chicago. Around 4 a.m. a terrible tragedy unfolded and I-80 eastbound was closed down for about four hours that morning. Illinois State Police rushed the scene near I-80 and Interstate 355. The 31-year-old Joliet man was taken away by ambulance and pronounced dead at Silver Cross Hospital.  Several hours later, State Police announced that Scofields car was struck by a Joliet motorist, Randy Mahoney, 43. Police said that Mahoneys vehicle swerved to avoid the 2011 KIA Soul that was stationary in the center lane. The KIA was facing in a northeasterly direction. Over the past three months, the I-80 fatality investigation has changed dramatically. Illinois State Police told Joliet Patch on Wednesday they are now trying to find a hit-and-run semi driver. It turns out that Scofields KIA was struck twice that morning; first by the hit-and-run motorist who caused the Joliet natives KIA to be rendered disabled. It was the semi collision that precipitated Scofield later being struck by the other car. The second crash involving Mahoney was responsible for the fatality. The crash reconstruction unit for the Illinois State Police told Patch they found brake marks at the scene of the fatality; these were attributed to the hit-and-run semi that kept on going. Damage from their collision was discovered on the passenger side of Scofields KIA, the State Police told Patch this week. For reasons unknown to this day, the semi driver chose not to stop. He or she kept driving east on I-80, state police said.  That vehicle knew that he made contact, Illinois State Police re-constructionist Dave Verkler told Joliet Patch on Wednesday. It was some type of commercial motor vehicle. But we have no specifics as far as color of the vehicle. The hit-and-run truck was likely a semi-tractor, Verkler said. That truck would have had damage points on the drivers side, or left side, of the commercial rig, he added. At least four motorists stopped to render aid to Scofield after they came upon the secondary collision with Mahoneys 2005 Toyota 4Runner in New Lenox Township. However, these witnesses left once the fire trucks and ambulances arrived at the scene. Now, Scofields family is hoping that someone will come forward now that they realize that the semi-trailer that caused the chain reaction crash has evaded the police. We believe that someone, possibly one of the people who stopped to help, may have seen the truck or possibly even saw it happen. We need those witnesses to contact the ... District 5 State Police Investigation Team Jim and Linda Brodnicki wrote to Patch. (Linda Brodnicki is the victims mother.) Someone had to have seen the truck either hitting Aarons car or leaving the scene, possibly both, they added. Verkler urges any witnesses to call State Police District 5 Lockport headquarters at 815-726-6377. According to Verkler, the commercial semi-trailer may have been headed toward Route 45 (LaGrange Road) or to Interstate 57. A third possibility was the Indiana Toll Road. The hit-and-run semi-tractor driver may be someone who travels I-80 regularly, he noted. Verkler said State Police searched the fatality scene for debris that may have fallen off the damaged semi but we came up with nothing. Verkler has investigated numerous fatalities for the State Police. Its his expertise. Patch asked him about the chances of finding the hit-and-run semi driver, given the passage of time. Theyre difficult, but not impossible, especially with the help of the public, he said confidently. The key is getting some assistance in identifying the vehicle that left the scene.

"PORTLAND, OR - Two people were stabbed to death aboard a MAX train in Portland Friday night after they tried to intervene when a man began yelling slurs at two Muslim women. A third person was stabbed, but survived. The suspect, Joseph Christian, 35, of North Portland, was arrested shortly after the incident near Providence Portland Medical Center, according to Portland police. Preliminary information indicates that the suspect was on the MAX train yelling various remarks that would best be characterized as hate speech toward a variety of ethnicities and religions, Portland police said in a statement. At least two of the victims attempted to intervene with the suspect and calm him down. The suspect attacked the men, stabbing three, before leaving the train.  A witness - 38-year-old Evelin Hernandez of Clackamas - told the Oregonian that the suspect began making racist comments toward the women, and when some passengers tried to quiet him down, he stabbed them. The two women who were the subject of the insults left the scene after the stabbing, according to the Oregonian. The incident happened at the Northeast 42nd Avenue MAX stop around 4:30 p.m. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights group, on Friday night called for President Donald Trump to condemn the killings. CAIR calls on President Trump to speak out personally against rising bigotry and acts of racial violence in America targeting Muslims and other minority groups after two people were stabbed to death in Oregon when they reportedly tried to intervene as a man yelled racist and Islamophobic slurs at two young Muslim women, one of whom wore an Islamic head scarf, or hijab, the group wrote in a statement.

"On March 8th, Bennington College joined Lecia Brooks, Outreach Director at the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), to discuss hate groups in America and understand the concept of nativism. The talk, titled “Tracking Hate and Nativism,” is a part of the series on forced migration, displacement, and education.

The Southern Poverty Law Center was founded by Morris Dees and Joseph Levin Jr. in 1971 as an effort to fight hate crime, advocate for civil rights, and help members of vulnerable groups seek justice against grievances.

Lecia Brooks began her talk by outlining the history of the Civil Rights Movement in America. She took us back to August 28, 1963, to the March on Washington, where over 250,000 people participated to advocate for the civil rights and liberties of African Americans. In 1964, the Civil Rights Act -- enacted on July 2 -- was a landmark legislation which outlawed discrimination on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, and sex.

“We are seeing these rights under threat today,” Lecia Brooks stated, bringing us to the exponential increase in hate crimes and hate rhetoric in America. The graph below shows the number of active hate groups from 1999 to 2017. The number of hate groups increased to 954 in 2017, from 917 in 2016. According to the SPLC, “Within the white supremacist movement, neo-Nazi groups saw the greatest growth – soaring by 22 percent. Anti-Muslim groups rose for a third straight year.”",1

"These days, masseuse Christian Fischer (above left) who is also a former Miss Gay Pride San Diego, is usually the one helping others to heal both physically and spiritually with crystals and oils at his pop-up shop in Ocean Beach. But today he is the one recovering from a violent attack which will forever affect his livelihood.

Fischer says on the evening of February 18, he was selling his merchandise along with other vendors at the seawall near the Ocean Beach Pier. He made a gemstone transaction with a gentleman at about 6:30 pm. The man left but returned soon after accusing Fischer of overcharging him by $10.

“The price for that crystal was over $100, but I sold it to him for $50 because he is also an artist,” says Fischer.

Although the buyer received a refund after complaining, according to Fischer, the man threatened him before leaving, saying he would clear him out of Ocean Beach.

Five minutes later, Fischer says a man on a skateboard rode by and grabbed artwork from his friend Megan’s table situated next to him. This led to Fischer pursuing the skater which ended on Niagara, a nearby side street. The thief fell off his skateboard and Fischer retrieved the merchandise.

“When I caught him and got the art back is when the other guy clocked me with a skateboard,” says Fischer noting it was the same man he had given the refund to earlier, “and then I realized this was his ‘clear me out of OB’ plan.”

Suffering pain from the bump on his head, Fischer says he thought he could smooth things over with the assailant and went over to talk to him after returning the stolen artwork to his friend.

But as he approached, Fischer says that’s when the man went into the trunk of his car and got a metal baseball bat, “He demolished my arm which doctors said if I hadnt blocked my face I’d be dead,” says Fischer. “He hit me four other times, cracking two ribs, and then I got away.”

According to San Diego Police, this happened between the hours of 6:45 pm and 7:00 pm, “No one is in custody at this time, they told San Diego Gay and Lesbian News

Police are pressing charges of assault with a deadly weapon but he has yet to be caught, said Fischer.

Along with being Miss Gay Pride In 2013, Fischer says he was once heavily involved in the Hillcrest scene, working at both Urban Mos and Gossip Grill. He was also active in raising money for the community.

I ran fundraisers with my drag performance collective known as Tribal Entertainment at Flicks, Richs, Gossip Grill, Mos, 1202, #1 Fifth Avenue, and Spin Nightclub, he says.

Today he not only sells healing alternative therapies but creates entertainment for Burning Man among other events, while also running shows in Reno, Tuscon, and Oregon.

Because of his injuries, Fischer is now worried about his livelihood, Ill never have full movement in my arm and have no idea how I will continue creating my art as an artist and healer who uses both hands to create and do massage.

"A Portland man is facing a hate crime charge after he allegedly verbally attacked two black people earlier this week, and physically stopped them from entering a MAX train.

Police say the incident was reported Tuesday at the Providence Park MAX station in SW Portland. Two African American individuals told police a stranger approached them out of the blue, called them the N-word and told them to go home.

They told police the man physically stopped them from entering the train with his body. The female victim said the suspect placed his hand on her shoulder to keep her from boarding the train, while threatening to beat up the male victim.

A woman who we will only identify as Sarah witnessed the attack.

I was walking down the street and I started to see them run from the MAX, she said, adding she heard Duncan yelling. “I thought, Oh no, not again. I knew it was something and again on the MAX ... it’s getting very dangerous.

The suspect, who has been identified as Rick Allen Duncan, told police he said Oh, you know, I was actually saying, Whats up my N***a?, not calling them a N***er. Duncan then told the officer these ghettos make him angry and hes sick and tired of these people having babies and moving out here.

Documents say Duncan then continued yelling racial epithets, police say, eventually telling the officer that he was only messing with him because of the Mexican Mafia and they need to quit taking our jobs.

This cant keep going on. What if that guy got on the MAX and what if he was the next Jeremy Christian? Sarah said, referring to the man accused of killing two people and injuring a third earlier this year aboard a MAX train following a racist rant.

Duncan was charged with intimidation and harassment. He was booked into Multnomah County Jail, but has since been released on his own recognizance.",1

Mexican business vandalized with hate speech

CLIFTON – A manufacturer and wholesaler of Mexican products was reported burglarized and vandalized with hate speech found throughout the warehouse.

Grupo La Providencia LLC, based on 1st Street in Passaic, expanded its operation in March by renting a space at 791 Paulison Ave. in Clifton.

According to police reports, the warehouse was broken into between May 13 and May 15. Detective Lt. Robert Bracken said the burglar or burglars gained entry by prying open a plywood board placed over a warehouse window.

Work orders on a white board were erased and replaced with scrawled terms such as “wetbacks” and “white power” as well as a swastika symbol, “KKK” and “666.” The words “Trump” and “Hitler” were also written on the board. Explicit language was used to emphasize some of the hate speech.

Clifton Police Department officers investigated the incident last week but, as of yet, have not uncovered any suspects or leads in the case. (Photo: Courtesy of Grupo La Providencia)

At the top of the board “we are the PS14” was written. And “PS14 where here” was written on a notebook page found in the office. Company employees believe the group claiming responsibility are a white supremacy gang that attended a school in the surrounding area.

[The police] mentioned there is a gang getting together right behind the warehouse by the train tracks, said Lilia Rios, the companys director of project development. Rios and her husband, Francisco Del Toro, own the business.

“But Im not afraid. Im willing to take this case as far as it can go either with the police or my own resources. We are honest, hardworking people and cannot tolerate this racist act or any other. Im not ashamed of who I am or where I came from.” Lilia Rios, co-owner of vandalized Clifton business

Although the office had been ransacked, numerous boxes were opened and items littered the warehouse floor, La Providencia employees said nothing was stolen.

Instead, Rios said water was sprayed on purchase orders and electronic devices. Papers, a metal knife, a hand cream container and a plastic water bottle were placed inside a microwave in what staff members believe was an attempt to start a fire.

Textiles, printing supplies and other flammable materials are stored in the industrial facility.

We are United States citizens, Rios said. My husband and my children were born in the U.S. How do you explain to your children theres people out there trying to hurt us just because they dont like where we are from, our culture, our language or our skin color? They could have finished our hard work of 12 years just by pushing a single button - start - on the microwave that wouldve started a fire.

As new tenants to the building, located next to the U.S. Post Office and Passport Center, Rios said the business had not yet installed a surveillance system. As a result, there is no video footage or photographic evidence of the burglars responsible for the hate crime.

Company representatives estimated $1,375 in damages to products and an additional $2,500 to electronic equipment. A carpet inside the office must also be replaced.

The business sells houseware items such as pans and cleaning supplies as well as imported specialties including authentic salsas, religious figurines, party products and Mexican candies.

Another set of notes included a pentagram and a message that PS14 w[h]ere here. (Photo: Courtesy of Grupo La Providencia)

Rios said she has never experienced such prejudice before.

But Im not afraid, she said. Im willing to take this case as far as it can go either with the police or my own resources. We are honest, hardworking people and cannot tolerate this racist act or any other. Im not ashamed of who I am or where I came from.

La Providencia services retail chains, supermarkets, bodegas and Mexican restaurants.

The company said police detectives investigating the case have not provided any suspects.

However, Bracken confirmed the burglary is being investigated as a hate crime and the department is currently following up on multiple leads.

"BURTON, MI - Gaynell Richardsons eyes welled with tears and her voice shook as she stood outside her Burton home Tuesday night where white paint still clung to the tan siding.

She remembered being shielded from racial taunts by her family as a child while growing up in South Carolina, not envisioning years later the message that would be scrawled across the exterior walls of her home.

During the overnight hours Monday, June 26, into Tuesday morning an unknown person or persons wrote KKK and an expletive on the home.

Larry Richardson, Gaynells husband, said the couples daughter notified him of paint on his vehicle in the driveway of the home off Belsay Road.

It wasnt until he walked around the home that he noticed the further damage.

When he saw the letters and what appears to be an expletive on the home, Larry Richardson, 62, said he felt disbelief, anger and asked himself, Why me?

Having lived in the subdivision for more than a decade, Larry Richardson said thered never been any issue until March.

Thats when someone threw rocks at the back of the familys home, putting holes in the siding and damaging a window.

It seems (intentional). The first time you may say is an isolated incident, he stated. The second time makes you think.

Burton police Chief Tom Osterholzer said the incident is being investigated as a potential hate crime. Both victims are black.

Gaynell Richardson, 61, questioned the motive of whoever would commit such an act.

Theres some sick people in this world, she said.

Larry Richardson said he is having some anxiety over the incident.

I feel threatened. When it comes close to home, it makes you start thinking, he said. The times were living in and things going on will make you stop and think... whats going on?

"Mar 13, 2017 by Paul Schrag

Anti-Semitic acts in the U.S. have surged in the form of bomb threats against Jewish community centers and the desecration of Jewish cemeteries. Threatening phone calls to Jewish organizations and schools in more than a dozen states on Feb. 27 marked the fifth wave of such incidents in two months.

The latest round of threats, raising the total to 90, occurred after hundreds of headstones were vandalized at two Jewish cemeteries in one week. More than 170 gravestones were toppled at Chesed Shel Emeth Cemetery in St. Louis, and 100 more were damaged at Mount Carmel Cemetery in Philadelphia. These violations are the latest examples of an alarming rise in incidents of bigotry, including a multiyear surge in hate crimes by white supremacists, documented by the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Among the acts of hate, cemetery vandalism stands out as an attack on sacred memory. Anyone who has buried a loved one can understand the pain a grave desecration causes. But only a member of a religious or racial minority group that has endured prejudice can know the anguish that wells up from an attack on the identity of one’s people.

Reports of those who gathered to repair the damaged gravestones bring to mind the reverence the ancient Israelites showed for the remains of their patriarch Joseph. What might appear to be little more than a biblical footnote is in fact a remarkable example of faithfulness. Before his death in Egypt, Joseph directed his family to “carry my bones up from this place” (Gen. 50:25). A distant future generation would fulfill this vow. Four hundred years passed before the exodus, followed by 40 years in the wilderness, but Joseph’s bones were never lost or forgotten. Finally, near the end of the Book of Joshua, we read: “And Joseph’s bones, which the Israelites had brought up from Egypt, were buried at Shechem” (24:32). Today’s burial sites are no less sacred. In a show of interfaith solidarity, Christians and Muslims joined Jews to restore the holy places and overcome the hate.",1

The number of anti-LGBT hate crimes in the District of Columbia increased last year by 59 percent, from 37 cases reported in 2015 to 59 reported in 2016, according to the city’s annual bias-related crime report.

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and Acting D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham, who released the report at a news conference on Friday, reiterated the city’s commitment to combat hate crimes against each of the eight categories of bias that the report monitors each year.

The release of the report came two days after a D.C. Superior Court grand jury handed down an 18-count indictment against three men who have been charged with the July 4, 2016 shooting death of transgender woman Deeniquia “Dee Dee” Dodds, 21.

Five of the counts, including first-degree felony murder while armed, robbery while armed, conspiracy and assault with a dangerous weapon, are listed in the indictment as hate crimes based on Dodds’ “actual or perceived” gender identity or expression.

Defendants Jolonta Little, Monte T. Johnson, and Cyheme Hall each pled not guilty at an arraignment on Friday morning. The three are being held without bond and are scheduled to return to court for a status hearing on April 20.

In the city’s hate crimes report released March 10, the category of an individual’s “Ethnicity/National Origin” emerged as the largest percentage jump in hate crimes – 300 percent – from 3 in 2015 to 12 in 2016, the report shows.

“Religion” based hate crimes represented the second largest percentage increase – 260 percent – from 5 in 2015 to 16 in 2016.

The report shows that although hate crimes targeting people based on their “Gender identity/Expression” and “Sexual Orientation” came in third and fourth place in the percentage increase last year, they continued their multi-year trend of comprising the largest number of hate crime cases.

The number of anti-transgender hate crimes (Gender Identity/Expression) increased by 90 percent last year – from 10 in 2015 to 19 in 2016, the report shows. The number of anti-gay, lesbian or bisexual related hate crimes (Sexual Orientation) increased by 48 percent – from 27 in 2015 to 40 in 2016, according to the report.

The number of “Race” related hate crimes dropped from 19 reported in 2015 to 14 in 2016, the report shows.

The other categories include:

• Disability—0 in 2015, 1 in 2016

• Political Affiliation—2 in 2015, 2 in 2016

• Homelessness—0 in 2015, 1 in 2016

“In Washington, D.C. we value diversity and inclusivity and want all of our residents and visitors to feel safe,” Bowser said at the news conference, which was held in the city’s Historic Synagogue at 600 I Street, N.W.

“No matter your race, your faith, your sexual orientation, your gender identity, your background – you should be able to live, work and play in Washington, D.C. without fear of violence or discrimination,” she said.

Bowser and Newsham, who Bowser nominated last month to be the city’s permanent police chief, called on those who feel they may be victims of a hate crime to report those crimes to police.

“We want to make it absolutely clear that we value the District’s diversity and that we will not tolerate hatred in our community,” Newsham said.

Acting D.C. Police Lt. Brett Parson, who oversees the police special liaison units, including the LGBT Liaison Unit, said police analysts consider it unclear whether the actual number of hate crimes in the city increased or whether more victims are reporting those crimes. He noted that in 2015 every officer on the force participated in a re-training course on bias-related crimes to enable them to better understand how to recognize such crimes and encourage citizens to report them.",1
"About 15 percent of Scots are Catholic

. The MSP raised this subject in Parliament in the third week of March, after a Catholic church located near the city of Glasgow was vandalized. The Blessed Sacrament was desecrated.

Statistics collated from Scottish Government records reveal that Catholics make up a lion’s share of the victims when it comes to religious-aggravated offenses in Scotland. It is clear that Scottish Roman Catholics require increased protection to fight hate crimes.

MSP Smith asked that equal prominence be given to anti-Catholicism as it has been given to anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. She made the comments after reports emerged that Cardinal Keith O’Brien had died after he suffered a fall. O’Brien, who at one time led Catholics in Scotland, was compelled to resign after it was alleged that he had engaged in inappropriate conduct. The fall resulted in a collarbone break and a head injury. The Cardinal died due to these injuries.

It is the belief of church leaders that such anti-Catholic sentiment is due to the 1560 Scottish Protestant Revolution. The 16th-century event led to the denunciation of Catholic worship and doctrine. Many Scottish Catholics believe discrimination against Catholics continues to this day. Matt McGlone, an author and journalist, concurs. He said that Scotland has rampant sectarianism. He pointed out that the problem is particularly prevalent in Scotland’s western part, although the anti-Catholic mentality is found all over Scotland.

Daniel Harkins of the Scottish Catholic Observer agrees. The newspaper editor said, “last month we reported on 15 employees of a local authority who had complained to their union of anti-Catholic discrimination by their supervisor — a convicted bigot. Our evidence is anecdotal, not statistical, but it has always been difficult to accurately measure levels of anti-Catholicism in Scotland.”

Smith requested the incumbent Scottish National Party to “go out to the Catholic population and listen to their concerns.” In response, Annabelle Ewing of the SNP said that the present administration has committed to manage such crimes. She said that about £13 million has been spent since 2012 to curtail sectarianism. Smith, in her reply, quoted the Archbishop of Glasgow, Philip Tartaglia, who said sectarianism is not much of a problem, but antipathy towards Catholicism is. A study made in 2015 by Social Attitudes Survey revealed that 15 percent of Scots identify themselves as Catholic.

One of the great things about Scotland, is we dont care what you religion you believe in, just whether youre Catholic or Protestant — John McGovern (@tellingfibulas) March 26, 2018

"Three women arrested recently by Brookfield police on suspicion of drunken driving were all cited for their second or third offenses. At 10:33 p.m. Jan. 26, a 28-year-old Eden woman was arrested for drunken driving, third offense, after a caller reported a vehicle stopped and running in the middle of the road near Tremont and Edwards streets. The caller said the SUV was not running and didnt appear to be occupied. But it was. Police found the woman slumped over the center console and passed out. An officer tried to get attention from outside but couldnt rouse her. He opened her door and still couldnt wake her by shouting, but she finally responded to a shake. He asked why she was in the middle of the road, and she said she wasnt – shed just gotten there. The woman couldnt find her drivers license, and told officers she hadnt been driving – shed been driven there by unknown male, she said. But police found no footprints in the fresh-fallen snow to suggest that. What they did find in the snow was a puddle of fresh urine. Also found in plain sight in the front seat of the car was a bag with two pipes and .61 gram of marijuana, so she was cited for that as well. The woman failed field sobriety tests and was taken for a mandatory blood draw to determine her blood alcohol level. At 5:07 p.m. last Tuesday, a 37-year-old Brown Deer woman was arrested on suspicion of her second OWI offense, and also cited for running a red light and driving while suspended. Officers were sent to Calhoun Road and Capitol Drive on callers report of a reckless driving. The caller stayed on the line, following and giving running description of the woman ahead of her weaving and veering all over the road. Eventually, she drove into a grassy area, stopped, got out and was staggering into a driveway in the 18100 block of Logan Drive when officers found her. The woman was swaying wildly and couldnt keep her balance. She was also at first unable to speak and couldnt keep her eyes open. When she did begin to relate, she told officers her dangerous driving behavior was from having trouble with the fog, and that she was stumbling because she was in high heels. She had no drivers license and guessed she must have left it at her mothers house, where shed just gone to drop off prescription medicine. Officers noted a very strong odor of intoxicants about her and asked if she could take a sobriety test. She tried but failed badly and was taken for blood draw. At 2:24 a.m. Friday, a 49-year-old Brookfield woman was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving, her second offense, after a traffic stop in the 16500 block of West Lisbon Road. A patrol officer going westbound on Lisbon Road, saw a driver coming at him, weaving well into his lane. He avoided her, made a U-turn, got behind her and stopped her at Pilgrim Road and Luella Drive. Asked if she had been drinking, she said shed had a few. When told she had been weaving dangerously on the road, she just shrugged. She failed sobriety tests and blew a .18 BAC.",0
"PLYMOUTH TOWNSHIP — Three new firefighters have been hired by Plymouth Township in preparation of reopening Fire Station No. 2. The board of trustees voted 6-1 in favor of the move Tuesday, which will allow the station in the townships northeast corner to be staffed. Supervisor Kurt Heise said at the meeting hes shooting for a mid-July reopening. We reopen Fire Station No. 2 so we can save lives and protect property, Heise said, according to a Plymouth Observer report. Fire Chief Dan Phillips said the station will cost approximately $172,800 for the remainder of this year, the newspaper reported. He said those costs would largely be paid with money saved after the township earlier eliminated part-time firefighter positions. Form a safety perspective, Phillips said reopening the station is the right thing to do. Im 100 percent confident that (reopening the station) will make a difference for people throughout the township, Phillips told the Observer. It will improve response time throughout the entire township.

Reopening it, however, will depend on a joint agreement between Plymouth and Northville townships to share the fire station, which sits on Wilcox Road west of Haggerty. Heise said Tuesday the agreement is imminent. Trustee Bob Doroshewitz voted against hiring the additional firefighters, the Plymouth Observer reported. He thinks the issue is being rushed and could have waited until the township board delves more deeply into its next budget plan. I dont think its fully baked, Doroshewitz said.

"(UPDATED 11:41 a.m.)—Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony W. Batts blamed gangs methods of killing for the spike in the Northern Districts homicides last year. Batts said micro rivalries between the Black Guerilla Family and Blood subset Tree Top Pirus were to blame for many of the murders in the Greenmount Avenue corridor last year. These guys were just assassins. These werent just regular shootings, Batts told members of the York Road Partnership during the groups meeting Wednesday. He recalled a conversation with a University of Maryland R. Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center doctor, who told him that 97 percent of people who make it to that hospital alive leave alive. Well [the gang members] werent allowing these guys to get to shock trauma, Batts said. What they were doing is walking up on each other down the alleys, and coming up close range, and shooting them in the head four or five times—I mean just viciousness. So they were executing each other. They were assassinating each other on both sides. He attributed the increase in homicides citywide in 2012 from the year before—despite the number of overall shootings being drastically down—to the fighting between these gangs. According to Comstat figures, the numbers city police use to track crime, city homicides increased from 197 in 2011 to 217 last year citywide. In the Northern District, the number of homicides surged from 15 in 2011 to 24 last year. Shootings citywide dropped from 379 in 2011 to 372 from the year before. Where as shootings jumped to 35 from 30 between 2011 and 2012 in the Northern District. Batts said because its taking police too long to put together the connections between murders, he wants to build better intelligence sharing in the department. I wanted us to know [where] these micro rivalries were taking place, Batts said. And I dont expect us to be able to stop shooting number one, because we cant have a police officer on every block at every location in the city. But I definitely wanted us to stop shootings two through 11. So we couldnt afford to have a shooting in July and catch it in October or November. He added that the Northern District had been driving him nuts last year, and that he had called Maj. Sabrina Tapp-Harper, the districts commander, into his office several times about the violence and the response. He said that theyve made several changes, and that theyre starting to see positive results. We sat down and we started putting a lot of different things in place and its working very well in the Northern, Batts said. Greenmount was on fire, it was just on fire. Thats where all these assassinations were taking place. According to Comstat figures updated through March 30, homicides citywide are up 48 from 41 during the same time period last year. While the number of shootings citywide are down to 62 compared to 78 during the same time last year. In the Northern District, there were four homicides compared to two at the same time last year. But shootings are down from eight at the same point in 2012 to three this year. Batts argued that increase in homicides in the district can be blamed primarily on domestic disputes, such as a murder-suicide in Waverly and a shooting death last month in Remington. Batts remarks were part of a larger address to residents about a wide variety of topics, such as making the department more efficient, the medias obsession with homicide numbers and trying to get residents from succeeding neighborhoods to help residents build commmunities in the Western District.

"Since the beginning of the year, there have been 32 bills introduced in 14 states proposing that members of law enforcement be included in hate crime protections, the same type of protections granted to people of color, religious minorities and members of the LGBTQ community, according to an analysis of state legislatures.

The Huffington Post, which conducted the analysis, says that “the wave of legislation, which classifies violent attacks on police as hate crimes, exposes an appetite to provide political sanctuary to an already protected class.”

Louisiana was the first state to pass a “Blue Lives Matter” bill last year, and it was followed by Mississippi, whose state Senate advanced a similar bill on Jan. 26. The Kentucky House of Representatives pushed forward its own version on Feb. 13.

The Huffington Post notes that most of the bills were not successful; there were at least 20 bills introduced over the last year that died either by vote or after being referred to a state legislative committee, and there are 22 currently sitting in a committee for review.

From the Huffington Post:

The wave of legislation exposes an appetite to provide political sanctuary to an already protected class. Including police officers in hate crime statutes is legally redundant, or even counterproductive, creating deeper divisions between police and the communities they serve. All 50 states, according to the Anti-Defamation League, have statutes that automatically increase the penalties for violent attacks on police. And, unlike hate crime laws, they don’t require prosecutors to prove motive.

Mark Potok, senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center, told the Huffington Post, “In the vast majority of states, you will get life or considerably less for murder, but if you murder a police officer, you are almost certain to get death. So the truth is that including police in hate crime laws is merely a political statement—and an unnecessary one at that.”

These laws are a recipe for abuse and disaster, and as the Huffington Post notes, they can make it harder to hold police accountable.

More from the Huffington Post:

A Louisiana police chief said in January that anyone who resists arrest or physically assaults a police officer could be charged with a hate crime under the state’s new law. This interpretation is dangerous: Cops can use charges of resisting arrest to justify excessive force and cover up abusive behavior. Videos of police brutality commonly include officers shouting “stop resisting!” as they pummel a defenseless—and not resisting—victim. Charges of resisting arrest or assaulting an officer often follow. “Any legislation for a ‘Blue Lives Matter’ bill seeks to instill intimidation and fear,” said Mike Lowe, a Black Lives Matter activist in San Antonio. “These protections make it easy to silence the voices of those seeking justice and accountability. I will not be silenced by it. All we want is justice and accountability, and law enforcement officers must be held accountable.”

These types of laws should be seen as intimidation tactics and methods of silencing. They open the door for police to abuse their power and use the law to their advantage to push back against those who are fighting for police accountability, racial equity and social justice in general.

We’ve already seen militarized police being used against those who gather to peacefully protest, and the more these laws pop up on the books, the more that type of response is only going to worsen.

Militarized police armed with a “Blue Lives Matter” law will be the ultimate weapon used against voices of dissent.

"Chancler Encalade, 20, pleaded guilty today to assaulting a man because of the victim’s sexual orientation, the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Eastern District of Texas, and U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ Dallas Division announced.

According to the plea agreement, Encalade admitted that he, Nigel Garrett, and Anthony Shelton used Grindr, a social media dating platform for gay men, to arrange to meet the victim at the victim’s home. Upon entering the victim’s home, the defendants restrained the victim with tape, physically assaulted the victim, and made derogatory statements to the victim for being gay. The defendants brandished a firearm during the home invasion, and they stole the victim’s property, including his motor vehicle.

A federal grand jury previously had returned an eighteen-count superseding indictment, against Encalade and three other men, which included charges for hate crimes, kidnappings, carjackings, and the use of firearms to commit violent crimes. The indictment also charged the defendants with conspiring to cause bodily injury because of the victims’ sexual orientation during four home invasions in Plano, Frisco, and Aubrey, Texas, from January 17 to February 7, 2017. Nigel Garrett and Cameron Ajiduah subsequently pleaded guilty to hate crime charges from this indictment, and both await sentencing.

“The Justice Department will not tolerate hate crimes against any individual, for any reason, including sexual orientation,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore. “Hate crimes are violent crimes and they attack the fundamental principles of the United States. The Justice Department will continue to aggressively investigate and prosecute hate crimes.”

“Crimes of violence are an investigative priority for the U.S. Attorney’s Office,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Brit Featherston. “An assault perpetrated because of one’s race, ethnicity, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, or among other prohibited factors, is an attack on American values. We will leave no stone un-turned to prosecute hate crimes.”

Encalade faces a maximum statutory penalty of life in prison and a $250,000 fine for his guilty plea to the hate crime charge under federal statutes, the defendant faces up to life in federal prison at sentencing. The maximum statutory sentence prescribed by Congress is provided here for information purposes, as the sentencing will be determined by the court based on the advisory sentencing guidelines and other statutory factors. A sentencing hearing will be scheduled after the completion of a presentence investigation by the U.S. Probation Office.

The investigation is being conducted by the ATF, the Plano Police Department, and the Frisco Police Department. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Tracey Batson of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Texas and Trial Attorney Saeed Mody of the Civil Rights Division.",1
"Before the homecoming festivities began at last weekend, students received a sobering reminder about the deadly consequences of making bad choices in their celebrations. An unusually subdued crowd of purple-and-gold-clad students watched as five of their classmates participated in a demonstration of the aftermath of a drunk driving accident. Emergency personnel from the Brentwood and also participated in the mock crash, creating an extremely realistic tableau for the audience of teenagers. Homecoming is a big time of celebration, said Wendy DuCassé, social worker for the Brentwood School District. We just want to bring awareness of alcohol, making good choices, drunk driving, things like that, because we know that the biggest cause of death in this age group is preventable accidents. Creating the 30-minute demonstration took months of work and collaboration between school officials, students, local emergency services and local business Terrys Towing, which provided the two damaged cars. Detective Paul Clayton, the school districts resource officer, helped to coordinate the logistics of the days event by advising the participating students on how to act out their parts. He said he was floored by the quality of the perfomances of the high school actors, expressing special admiration for senior Marion Richter, who portrayed the drunk driver in the accident. She was outstanding, he said, She behaved in exactly the ways that you would see from an intoxicated person. DuCassé said that she hoped that the personal and immediate nature of the demonstration would make it more memorable for Brentwood students as they began their homecoming celebrations. If we can do a scenario like this, where it makes somebody think twice before making a bad choice, then weve done our job, Clayton said. Download the movie",0
"In this week’s roundup: The mountain of studies that obliterate the link between immigrants and crime, hate attacks at Pride events, how white supremacy may dissolve a town’s government and more.

Donald Trump began his presidential campaign by calling Mexican immigrants drug dealers and rapists.

He’s doubled down since becoming president, using the specter of criminality to justify separating families at the border and other immigration crackdowns.

It’s a sentiment many Americans share. A 2017 Gallup survey found 45 percent of respondents believed immigrants are making the crime situation in America worse.

That’s not true. Scores of academic studies have disproved the racist theory that immigrants, especially nonwhite ones, pose an elevated threat of criminality.

As immigration goes up, crime goes down, according to a 2018 study from the University of Wisconsin and Purdue University.

Increased immigration likely caused crime to decrease in most metro areas, a massive study led by a researcher at State University of New York Buffalo found.

First-generation immigrants are far less likely to commit crime than native-born Americans, according to a Pew study .

“Criminal conviction and arrest rates for immigrants were well below those of native-born Americans,” which holds true for both legal and undocumented immigrants, according to a Cato Institute analysis of data from the Texas Department of Public Safety.

“Undocumented immigrants may be less likely to engage in serious criminal offending behavior (than U.S. natives),” a researcher at Texas A&M International University found. The report added that immigrants are, if anything, more likely to be victims of crime than native-born Americans.

“Foreign-born individuals exhibit remarkably low levels of involvement in crime across their life course” and second-generation immigrants offend at roughly the same rate as all native-born Americans, reads a study out of University of Massachusetts Boston.

“U.S.-born adult men are incarcerated at a rate over two-and-a-half times greater than that of foreign-born men,” a study by the Public Policy Institute of California discovered, using data from California prisons.

“Compared to documented immigrants and US-born peers, undocumented immigrants report engaging in less crime prior to and following their first arrest,” a paper published in the journal Migration Letters found.

Immigrants are incarcerated at one-fifth the rate of native-born Americans, a 2007 study looking at data back to 1980 found. The study’s authors conclude: “The process of migration selects individuals who either have lower criminal propensities or are more responsive to deterrent effects than the average native.”

Finding that immigrants are “much less likely than natives to commit crimes,” a 2015 report by the National Academy of Sciences blames the perception of a link between immigrants and crime on, “ ‘issue entrepreneurs’ who promote the immigrant-crime connection in order to drive restrictionist immigration policy … and media portrayals of non-whites and immigrants as prone to violence and crime.”

“Undocumented immigration has not increased the prevalence of drug or alcohol problems,” notes a study looking at data stretching between 1990 and 2014.

Hate strikes Pride events

LGBTQ Pride Month is the commemoration of a community standing up against hate.

In June 1969, New York Police Department officers raided Stonewall Inn, a bar in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village that effectively functioned as community center for the city’s marginalized LGBTQ community. During the raid, police violently dragged patrons out of the bar, firing off homophobic insults in the process. The raid sparked massive demonstrations. Police turned fire hoses on protesters and the bar was hit with a firebomb. The first Pride marches were around the raid’s one-year anniversary.

The LGBTQ community has won civil rights victories in the decades since. But violence remains.

This year, Pride celebrations around the country were marred by shocking incidents of hate-fueled violence, much of it in direct reaction to progress made by the movement.

Here are some examples of hate at Pride we found this month:

• Kynan Dutton was arrested at the Knox Pridefest in Knoxville, Tennessee, for allegedly throwing a man to the ground. Dutton, a leader in the neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement, was there to demonstrate against the event. “There’s pro-white organizations out here for the protesting of this act of sexual deviance and degeneracy that is being promoted upon our youth,” Dutton told Knox News.

• A Massachusetts woman yelled homophobic slurs at a man carrying a rainbow flag on the subway following the Boston Pride Parade. She later pulled a knife on a bystander who intervened on the victim’s behalf.

• Four gay men were reportedly chased by a mob shouting anti-gay harassment during a Pride event in Salt Lake City. The victims ran into a local dessert shop. The shopkeeper, Terrance Mannery, fought off the mob until a security guard entered the fray and the dispersed the mob. “The way that I was raised was to stand up for yourself, stand up against bullies, and try to do unto others as you want done to yourself,” Mannery told the Salt Lake City Tribune.

* In the hours after a Pride event in Jackson Heights, Queens, a 25-year-old man was assaulted by two suspects who yelled anti-gay epithets while attacking him from behind.

• A brother and sister were assaulted by a man as they were making their way home from a Pride event in Portland, Oregon. “During the attack he was using the word ‘faggot,’ ” Katelin Durnal told KGW8. “After he punched (my brother) Greg he told us to have a gay day.”

• In April, four men were charged with beating up a gay couple following a Pride event in Miami Beach, Florida. Prosecutors charged the suspects with anti-gay hate crimes. However, the father of one of the suspects recently defended his son against accusations of homophobia, saying that he himself is gay and raised his son with his same-sex partner.

“Pride is a time of increased political visibility as well as a public celebration of who we are as LGBTQ people – and that visibility has frequently been met with violent backlash,” GLAAD Communications Director Sue Yacka-Bible told us.

Alleged white supremacist takeover could mean the end of a North Dakota town

The residents of a tiny North Dakota town are now faced with the potential of having white supremacists on their City Council.

As a result of the recent election, the mayor would prefer to just shut it down. Leith, North Dakota, Mayor Ryan Schock has collected signatures from 12 of his 18 constituents calling for the abolition of the city’s government, ceding control to the county.

In 2013, a white supremacist named Craig Cobb purchased a score of properties around town with the intention of turning into a haven of white nationalism. The town’s residents rallied together and blocked Cobb’s efforts. Cobb received four years’ probation for terrorizing local residents by parading through Leith openly carrying weapons.

You may remember the name Kynan Dutton from earlier in this Hate Report. He was arrested with Cobb during his first attempt to take over Leith, as the man charged with a hate crime for assaulting someone at this year’s Knoxville Pride festival.



After his sentencing, Cobb vowed to retire from white nationalism. However, two people who moved to town during Cobb’s takeover attempt, and bought property their property from him, just won seats on the council.

“We have to dissolve the town because that idiot (Cobb) showed up,” Schock told the Bismarck Tribune. “He wanted control of it, and now he can’t have it.”

The new council members pushed back assertions that they’re connected with hate.

“We were plain people when we lived in Wisconsin and we’re plain workers here. There’s nothing special about us, we don’t belong to any clubs, any organizations,” one of the new council members told local news station KFYR. “Not a political party, not so here. We’re just trying to help the city,” added the other.

A vote for whether or not to dissolve the town is scheduled for July 23.

The SPLC says sorry

Earlier this year, the Southern Poverty Law Center published a report it called a “Field Guide to Anti-Muslim Extremists.” In that guide, it included Quilliam Foundation and its founder Maajid Nawaz, a move the organization now admits was a mistake.

The SPLC has pulled the guide from its site, apologized to both Nawaz and Quilliam, and agreed to pay out over $3 million in a settlement. The Daily Beast reports that the original version of the guide accused Nawaz of causing “hate-based violence” and giving a list of radical Muslims to the London Metropolitan Police, a claim Nawaz denies.

“(Nawaz) thinks the SPLC authors may have been led astray by their sources,” the Daily Beast reports. “He suggested they were unfamiliar with the political and social terrain in Britain and relied on ‘community groups’ with their own Islamist political agendas.”

As a teen, Nawaz was a member of the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir, but renounced the ideology after a stint in an Egyptian prison. He founded Quilliam to advocate against Islamist fundamentalism.

“Since we published the Field Guide, we have taken the time to do more research and have consulted with human rights advocates we respect,” the SPLC wrote in a statement. “We’ve found that Mr. Nawaz and Quilliam have made valuable and important contributions to public discourse, including by promoting pluralism and condemning both anti-Muslim bigotry and Islamist extremism.”

“Although we may have our differences with some of the positions that Mr. Nawaz and Quilliam have taken, they are most certainly not anti-Muslim extremists,” the statement continued.

Other entities the SPLC has accused of trafficking in hate jumped on the opportunity to pile onto the civil rights group. In a joint statement released last week, a coalition of 47 groups, including Center for Security Policy and former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, urged the public to stop relying on the SPLC for information about hate groups.

The letter read:

Editors, CEOs, shareholders and consumers alike are on notice: anyone relying upon and repeating its misrepresentations is complicit in the SPLC’s harmful defamation of large numbers of American citizens who, like the undersigned, have been vilified simply for working to protect our country and freedoms.

Congressman who retweeted neo-Nazi doesn’t say sorry

Republican Iowa Congressman Steve King recently retweeted a tweet by Mark Collett, a British neo-Nazi, criticizing nonwhite immigration into European countries.

King’s tweet drew widespread criticism, even drawing a mild rebuke from the office of House Speaker Paul Ryan. However, King, who frequently promotes white nationalism, has refused to back down.

In an interview with CNN, King insisted he wasn’t aware of Collett’s white supremacist background, but said he had no regrets about sharing the message. “Because then it’d be like I’m admitting that I did something, now I’m sorry about it. I’m not sorry. I’m human,” King said.

During the interview, he repeated sentiments that wouldn’t be out of place on white supremacist forums like Stormfront. “I want to see the American civilization strengthened,” King said. “That means we are a Judeo-Christian country, and we could not have succeeded without our Founding Fathers’ (knowing) that,” he said.

"Two female juveniles kept the loss prevention officers at Kohls on Route 9 very busy recently. One of the girls, 17, was charged with shoplifting 27 items valued at $813.64. The other, 15, was charged with shoplifting 20 items valued at $813.20, Police Chief David A. Paprota said. Officer Jesse Dalziel and Charles May responded to Kohls at 304 Route 9 North in Forked River at 5:35 p.m. on Feb. 29 on a shoplifting report. The loss prevention employee told police that the two juveniles took 47 items from the cosmetics and jewelry section of the store and went into a dressing room, the chief said. The merchandise was no longer visible when the girls left the dressing room. The loss prevention employee found empty merchandise packaging when he checked the dressing room. The juveniles were stopped when they tried to leave the store without paying for the concealed items, Paprota said. The juveniles were taken to Lacey Township police headquarters where they were processed and charged. They were turned over to the custody of their parents, the chief said.",0
"REDWOOD CITY, CA -- A man accused of going on a random drive-by shooting spree starting with an apparent road rage incident last month in East Palo Alto pleaded not guilty to all charges Tuesday, San Mateo County prosecutors said. Oscar Alfredo Tapia-Carmona, a 30-year-old resident of East Palo Alto whos already on felony probation, was stopped at a red light at the intersection of West Bayshore and Capitol Expressway when he got angry with a stranger in an adjacent vehicle, then allegedly took out a handgun and fired a shot that went through the victims open window. Tapia-Carmona allegedly sped off, but was followed by the victim, who tried to take a picture of his license plate. After that the defendant stopped at the intersection of Newell and Woodland, then allegedly fired two shots at a 65-year-old woman carrying her groceries home. The victim was struck in the arm. The force of the gunshot knocked her down and the bullet shattered at least one of the bones. Tapia-Carmona once again allegedly fled the scene, driving into Palo Alto and allegedly striking a bicyclist, who wasnt injured - before going to work. He allegedly told his coworkers that he had been chased by several people on his way to work. The police were notified and Tapia-Carmona was arrested. Investigators said they found a Beretta handgun in his possession. District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe called it odd to see crimes like this with no apparent motive. The conduct itself, the lack of motivation for this dangerous conduct and the lack of explanation, makes one wonder if he has a mental illness, Wagstaffe said. Tapia-Carmona remains in custody on no-bail status, and is scheduled to return to court April 23 to set a date for his preliminary hearing. If convicted and sentenced, he could face life in prison, according to Wagstaffe. Defense attorney Savas Loukedis did not immediately respond to a request for comment on his clients behalf. --Bay City News/Photo via Shutterstock",0
"San Diego, CA — The identity of a transient man whose body was found Tuesday at a homeless encampment near Mission Hills has been released by authorities.

A man who repeatedly beat a woman with a hammer in Koreatown has been charged with attempted murder and a hate crime enhancement, authorities said Thursday.

The 24-year-old woman was attacked at about 6 p.m. Friday outside a business in the 1000 block of South Vermont Avenue, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.

A security guard saw what was happening and stopped the attack, which was captured on surveillance video, and, along with a witness, held the suspect until police arrived and arrested him, LAPD Capt. David Kowalski said.

The woman suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital, where she received treatment and was released, Kowalski said.

The suspect, identified as Jae Won Yang, 22, who is a Korean national, targeted the woman because she was female and Korean, the captain said. Police said he asked her if she was Korean and set upon her after she answered yes.

Yang was charged on Tuesday and pleaded not guilty to one count of attempted murder with allegations that he inflicted great bodily injury, that he used a hammer as a deadly and dangerous weapon and a hate crime allegation, according to Ricardo Santiago of the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office.

He is due back in court on March 27 for the setting of a preliminary hearing to determine if there is enough evidence for him to stand trial, Santiago said.

Yang is being held at the Twin Towers Correctional Facility in downtown Los Angeles in lieu of $1.075 million bail.

"New Haven police investigate assault on gay man with possible hate crime elements Assault victim believes his sexual orientation was targeted

NEW HAVEN >> The 26-year-old man said the first clenched fist struck the back of his head. The second one struck his jaw.

The Hartford resident was on Kensington Street Tuesday when he said he was attacked by at least three individuals, who struck him until he fell to the ground. The victim said the individuals kicked him while he lie on the ground. The entire attack took several minutes, though he said it felt like years.

The Register is not using the man’s name at his request.

“It felt like 10 years, but it had to be around seven minutes max,” he said. “It happens so fast. I thought I was going to die.”

The individuals used gay slurs while attacking the man, who is gay and said he believes his sexual orientation played a role in the attack. He also believes the three attackers may have thought he was a sex worker.

“I do feel like my sexual orientation (was) a part of this crime,” he said, adding: “That’s what you think of me? That’s what you think of my people? You think that we all want to be sex workers.”

New Haven police spokesman Officer David Hartman confirmed Thursday police are investigating the assault and also are exploring whether the alleged crime has elements of a hate crime. Hartman said the victim told police he was meeting someone contacted through an online dating app near Kensington Street and Chapel Street. The victim described at least two attackers, including one male and one female.

The alleged attack came a day before U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal spoke at a press conference in Hartford addressing three recent LGBTQ teen suicides and bullying of LGBTQ youth. The aim is more public opposition to what is seen as an increase in hate incidents against youth based on their sexual orientation and gender identification.

Both Blumenthal and Robin P. McHaelen, executive director of True Colors Inc., alleged that President Donald Trump’s rhetoric is promoting negative bias. McHaelen’s organization provides services for LGBTQ youth and their families. McHaelen joined Hartman last week in a discussion about the relationship between the LGBTQ community and law enforcement.

The attackers stole the victim’s cellphone, his driver’s license, a credit card and his Social Security card. The victim said he had trouble getting help following the attack, with at least three people refusing to help him by calling police. One even thought he was panhandling, he said.

At that point, the victim said he had blood running down his arms, which were scraped. He was still finding new cuts on Thursday while recalling the attack. His head struck the ground during the attack, which prompted a scan at a local hospital hours later that ruled out a concussion.

In some ways, the attack hasn’t stopped, he said. The victim said he believes the alleged attackers have created Facebook accounts to harass him on the social media website. The account has been posting remarks on the Facebook updates and made specific references to the attack.

After informing New Haven police, the victim said he was advised to notify Hartford police about the online harassment. He said the Facebook page is treating the attack as a joke.

“I’m being harassed at home,” the victim said. “This is concerning cyber-bullying.”

The victim said the New Haven police officer who assisted him following the attack tried to calm him down. He took down information and asked whether he needed additional medical attention, eventually calling for an ambulance. While they waited, the victim said he sat in the cruiser’s backseat.

“I wasn’t happy about it but I felt a little bit safer because I am in this cop car and I knew nothing can happen to me here,” he said.

"WAVERLY, TN -- Humphreys County sheriffs deputies executed search warrants Friday on two homes connected to missing Nashville firefighter Jesse Reed, as efforts to locate the 32-year-old who drove into the Tennessee River Monday continue.

Reed had lived at both homes, according to Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis.

"× More details released in murder of mutilated transgender teen; some wonder why suspects aren’t facing hate crime charges

CABOOL, Mo. – The gruesome murder of a transgender teen in Missouri has some wondering why the three main suspects arrested aren’t facing hate crime charges.

Texas County authorities have charged Andrew Vrba, Isis Schauer and Briana Calderas with the first-degree murder of 17-year-old Ally Lee Steinfeld, whose family had reported her missing earlier this month.

According to police reports, Vrba, 18, admitted to killing Steinfeld and burning her body.

Schauer and Calderas allegedly helped Vrba hide Steinfeld’s body. Schauer and Calderas told police Vrba claimed he stabbed the victim’s genitals multiple times and gouged her eyes out.

All three are being held in jail without bond and have yet to be arraigned. Their lawyers did not immediately respond to CNN’s requests for comment.

The grisly details of Steinfeld’s death have prompted some to call for the suspects to face hate crime charges.

“There couldn’t be a more vivid example of someone being targeted because of their gender identity than being stabbed in their genitals,” said Dru Levasseur, director of the Transgender Rights Project for Lambda Legal, a nonprofit working organization for the civil rights of the LGBTQ community.

“I’ve heard complete outrage from trans people about how they (authorities) could not prosecute this” as a hate crime, Levasseur told CNN.

According to the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), which tracks violence against transgender people, Steinfeld is the 21st transgender person who has been killed in the United States in 2017.

“HRC is also deeply concerned about the investigation into her death,” said HRC legal director Sarah Warbelow in a statement to CNN.

“As details of her brutal murder are confirmed, it seems likely that anti-transgender animus played a role,” Warbelow said. “This broader epidemic of violence against the transgender community, often motivated by hatred, must come to an end.”

Police have not released a motive for Steinfeld’s murder, and the prosecution is not pursuing hate crime charges.

Murder followed ‘physical altercation’

Steinfeld’s family filed a missing person’s report on September 14, though they hadn’t heard from the teen since “approximately September 1,” according to police reports obtained by CNN.

Police went to the Cabool, Missouri, trailer home of 24 -year-old Calderas after Steinfeld’s family said Calderas, Vrba and Schauer, both 18, were the last people to be with the teen. The family had contacted the trio, the report says, but believed they were being lied to about Steinfeld’s whereabouts.

Steinfeld’s family, police and the suspects still refer to her by her name given at birth and use male pronouns, but her family says she referred to herself using female pronouns.

In an interview with detectives, Schauer denied knowing where Steinfeld was located, but said Steinfeld “had been in a physical altercation with Vrba on September 3, 2017.” After the altercation, Schauer said, Steinfeld left and no one had seen her since.

But when police interviewed Vrba, he confessed to murdering the victim. “Vrba stated that he had to kill Steinfeld,” the police report says, “and he planned to do so by poisoning him, but Steinfeld would not drink the poison so he used a knife instead.”

While the details were left out of the police report, a Texas County deputy said Vrba described for police how he stabbed Steinfeld in the living room of Calderas’ trailer, and told them that he, Schauer and Calderas took the body outside to burn it.

When investigators searched the property, the report says, they found human remains in a burn pile and a garbage bag by the chicken coop that contained “numerous human bones and burnt trash.”

Calderas confessed to police she tried to help hide the body and told them where the murder weapon could be found.

Calderas and Schauer both told police Vrba had told them about gouging out Steinfeld’s eyes and stabbing her in the genitals “multiple times, and that he had bragged about the murder and went into detail on how the murder took place.”

All three are facing first degree murder charges, armed criminal action, and abandonment of a corpse. A fourth suspect, 25-year-old James Grigsby, is facing lesser charges for helping the others hide Steinfeld’s body. His attorney also did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.

Hate crime charge can’t apply to first-degree murder

In a statement, Texas County prosecutor Parke Stevens Jr, defended the decision to not pursue hate crime charges by pointing out a first-degree murder charge carries the “highest and most severe form of punishment available in the State of Missouri.”

In Missouri, hate crime charges cannot be added to a first-degree murder charge, only lesser charges like assault, harassment or property damage.

“First-degree murder is punishable by death,” said CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson. “The hate crime law operates to ‘enhance’ punishments regarding certain crimes — upon a showing of hateful motivation.”

Since a first-degree murder charge is punishable by either death or life imprisonment, Jackson said, a hate crime charge cannot apply to a murder.

Additionally, it could complicate the job of prosecutors trying to convict defendants.

“A prosecutor generally does not have to prove motive,” he said. “In hate crimes, you must. Therefore, they make the job harder of a prosecutor.”

Jackson said of the prosecutor’s decision, “It’s the right call — and only call, under the law.”

But it shouldn’t matter whether the hate crime charge wouldn’t enhance the sentencing, Levasseur said. “Regardless of whether the choices are life in jail or execution, having a hate crime prosecution matters.”

To him, it’s about addressing the bigger question of why transgender people are so often targeted and the victims of violence.

“There’s not enough attention being paid to this issue,” Levasseur said.

“Its an opportunity for the state of Missouri to take a stand and say, ‘Even though it wouldn’t make a difference in terms of sentencing, we are going to implement this (hate crime) law because we recognize this is horrific and that transgender people exist,” he said. “We need to be working on looking at the larger picture.”",1

San Diego Police and paramedics responded shortly after 7:30 p.m. Saturday to the alley in the 2200 block of Imperial Avenue, where the victim was beaten in a random attack, according to Officer Robert Heims.

The 56-year-old victim, an African American, was standing in the alley when a Latino suspect walked up and began hitting him, in what police called an unprovoked attack. The attacker knocked the victim to the ground, then kicked him several times.

While pummeling and kicking the man, the attacker used racial epithets to express his dislike of African-Americans, Heims said. The suspect left the area but returned a short time later.

“The victim was still trying to recover when the suspect started hitting him again,” Heims said. “This time he was hitting him with a bamboo stick in the head and body.”

The victim was hospitalized with several injuries, which were not considered to be life-threatening. The suspect was described as a Hispanic man, five-foot, five-inches to five-foot, eight-inches tall, clean shaven, wearing a blue hat, blue t-shirt, blue shorts and low top shoes. He had two tattoos on both calves, possibly an “S” and “D.”

He was wanted on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and committing a hate crime, Heims said.

"The Denver District Attorney has charged two women suspected of attacking a black RTD bus driver with a hate crime, and leveled assault and other charges against a man who allegedly participated in the beating.

Deanne Y. Sandoval, 45, and Destiny Sandoval, 25, allegedly refused to pay the fare when they boarded the Regional Transportation District Route 30 bus at the intersection of South Federal Boulevard and West Mississippi Avenue on the evening of Feb. 23.

The driver told them to leave the bus and they refused, according to a Denver Police probable cause statement.

“Destiny spit on the driver, and the driver pushed her out of the front door of the bus. Deanne then jumped on the victim and began assaulting him,” the statement said.

The driver tried to block the blows, and push the women away.

"A Lakeville couple who left their German shepherd at a kennel in Rosemount for a weekend in October and returned to find that the dog had been hit by a motorcycle and had to be destroyed have filed a claim against the kennel and its owner. Peter and Patricia Fahnlander filed the claim in Dakota County Conciliation Court against theLazy Leash in Rosemount and its owner, Jo Hall, alleging that Hall or someone who works for her negligently allowed their dog Sheba to run into traffic. David Hellmuth, an Edina attorney who is advising the Fahnlanders in the case, said he volunteered to help when he heard their story. Its just so wrong, said Hellmuth, who is a business partner of Peter Fahnlander. This is a very personal and sad, tragic situation. The dog was part of their family. Hellmuth said the Fahnlanders visited the Lazy Leash a few weeks before their planned trip to make sure it had appropriate accommodations for their dog. They dropped off Sheba on Oct. 12, a Friday, and went to northern Minnesota for the weekend. When they returned home on Sunday evening, they went to the kennel to collect Sheba. Jos boyfriend was there, and basically apologized to Peter, Hellmuth said. He said, Yep, you know what, I screwed up. I tied the dog up rather than putting her in the fenced area. The dog must have chewed the leash, and the dog ran away. A stunned Fahnlander asked when Sheba had escaped, and the man at the kennel told him that it happened two days earlier – the day they dropped her off. Fahnlander asked why nobody had called him, and said he would have returned to the Twin Cities immediately to look for the dog, according to Hellmuth. The man at the kennel told Fahnlander that someone had called Rosemount police on Friday to report the dog missing. So Fahnlander began calling around to local police departments. When he spoke to Rosemount police, he discovered that Sheba had run into traffic and had been hit by a motorcycle. Her injuries were so serious that she had to be destroyed. When Peter told me what happened, I told him Id write the woman a letter, Hellmuth said. I love animals, and this is a ridiculous situation. Hellmuth sent Hall a demand letter, asking her to pay compensation to the Fahnlanders. When he called her to follow up, she claimed not to know what he was talking about, telling him that she had no paperwork proving that the dog was at her kennel. At that point, Hellmuth prepared a conciliation court action for the Fahnlanders. The law is such that a dog is considered personal property, he said. You cant get emotional distress damages, or wrongful death damages. But I could do this much for them. Halls legal woes might not end with the conciliation court action. After Hellmuth filed the action on the Fahnlanders behalf, he got a call from Lakeville attorney Art Kosieradzki, who is representing the motorcyclist who hit Sheba and was injured in the crash. My client was just minding his business, driving down the road, when this dog ran out in front of him, Kosieradzki said. Its lucky the dog didnt kill him. Hall, contacted by phone, she didnt know anything about the conciliation court action, and continued to deny that Sheba had ever been at her kennel. If theres no paperwork, the dog was not here, Hall said. There was no dog, no paperwork, no nothing. Hellmuth called Halls attitude unconscionable, and Kosieradzki agreed. Shes got this goofy story that the dog wasnt there, he said. We will ultimately get to the bottom of it, Ill tell you that. I dont know where she thinks shes going to get by saying the dog wasnt there. The Fahnlanders conciliation court claim is for $2,643, which includes court costs and the cost to have Shebas remains cremated. According to court documents, Sheba was valued at $2,450. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Dec. 11 in Apple Valley.",0
"President Donald Trump seemed to revert back to blaming both sides for the deadly Charlottesville white nationalists rally on Saturday reports the Associated Press.

Today he said from Trump Tower in New York, the groups protesting against the white supremacists were, “also very violent.”

He goes on to label the counter-protestors as “alt-left reports AP.

Trump was criticized on Saturday for his lack of denouncement of neo-Nazis and white supremacists saying both sides were to blame, even after a car slammed into a counter protest crowd killing one person and injuring several others.

He somewhat amended that stance on Monday, saying, Racism is evil -- and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans,

But today he appeared to double-down on his original statement with blame falling toward counter protestors too, “nobody wants to say that,” he added.

Former KKK leader David Duke applauded the presidents statement in a Twitter post:

Thank you President Trump for your honesty & courage to tell the truth about #Charlottesville & condemn the leftist terrorists in BLM/Antifa.",1

Prosecutors say Majors fatally shot Jabara after bombarding him and his family for years with racial epithets, including filthy Lebanese and Moo-slems. The Jabaras are Christian.

Majors defense attorney, assistant public defender Travis Smith, told jurors that Majors had untreated schizophrenia. Defense attorneys have indicated they will present a defense based on Majors mental health, although Majors was previously found competent to stand trial.

"The fiery destruction of a Pageland building Friday is a hate crime, allege the owners.

DON WORTHINGTON/Editor A Friday fire destroyed an outbuilding owned by Tim and Neil Griffin on West McGregor Street, and Tim’s car as well. Buy this photo DON WORTHINGTON/Editor Tim Griffin Buy this photo DON WORTHINGTON/Editor An Oct. 13 fire consumed a one-story building that Tim and Neil Griffin built as a clubhouse for their Miss Pageland Pageant girls. More than 1,000 gowns burned in the fire. Buy this photo

The 2 a.m. fire destroyed a building in the backyard of 808 W. McGregor St.

Property owners Tim and Neil Griffin say their openly gay lifestyle is the reason for the fire. The two said they have been a couple for about 15 years and married for three.

The S.C. Law Enforcement Division is investigating the fire. Pageland Police Chief Craig Greenlee requested SLED because the fire was suspicious.

No cause or estimated damage has been released.

“We’re done,” Tim Griffin said Friday. “We fear for our lives and we fear for the safety of the pageant girls.”

The Griffins said they will leave Pageland and shut down the Miss Pageland pageant, which they operate through the Griffin Scholarship Foundation.

The destroyed building was to have been a “clubhouse” for the pageant girls. Tim Griffin said there were about 1,000 gowns in the building, which the couple lent to pageant contestants. The one-story building had recently been finished, Tim Griffin said.

The Griffins will honor their commitments to their pageant girls through the state competition in January, Tim Griffin said Monday. He said the pageant organization will likely shut down in March.

Tim Griffin said he awoke Neil when he smelled smoke about 2 a.m. Friday.

Initially they thought the fire was coming from a window air conditioner. When they opened the curtains they saw their backyard building in flames.

At the same time, a passer-by was knocking at their door to alert them about the fire.

Pageland police and fire department personnel responded within minutes.

“By the time they got here, the building was 90 percent gone,” Neil Griffin said.

The fire also destroyed a BMW automobile and slightly damaged a pick-up truck. The vehicles were parked next to a brick garage. The fire had reached the garage when firefighters arrived.

Tim and Neil Griffin said they believe the fire was a hate crime because of escalating social media posts about them.",1
"TEXAS COUNTY, Missouri - After the murder of a transgender teen in Missouri, prosecutors said the three main suspects arrested will not face hate crime charges.

Texas County authorities have charged Andrew Vrba, Isis Schauer, both 18, and Briana Calderas, 24, with the first-degree murder of 17-year-old Ally Lee Steinfeld after she was reported missing on Sept. 14.

Steinfeld, who was born as Joseph Matthew Steinfeld, was missing for a month before police found her badly burned remains in a bag dumped in a chicken coop near the mobile home where the teen lived in with the suspects, reports said.

Calderas and Schauer allegedly said Vrba had repeatedly stabbed the victim’s genitals inside the residence’s living room, gouged her eyes out and later bragged about the killing, according to court records.

The teens allegedly burned and disposed of the body after the killing, reports said.

After the suspects arrests, Calderas allegedly confessed to police she tried to help hide the body and told them where the murder weapon could be found, according to reports.

The details of Steinfeld’s murder have caused LGBTQ advocates to call for the suspects to face hate crime charges.

There couldnt be a more vivid example of someone being targeted because of their gender identity than being stabbed in their genitals, Dru Levasseur, director of the Transgender Rights Project for Lambda Legal, told CNN. Ive heard complete outrage from trans people about how they (authorities) could not prosecute this as a hate crime.”

Authorities said, however, that they do not believe the murders were motivated by the teen’s sexuality.

I would say murder in the first-degree is all that matters. That is a hate crime in itself,” Prosecutor Parke Stevens Jr told the Associated Press.

In Missouri, hate-crime charges can not be added onto a first-degree murder charge.

Human Rights Campaign spokesman Chris Sgro said Steinfeld’s death marks the 21st transgender person to be killed in the U.S. this year.

This violence, often motivated by hatred, must come to an end. We will continue to mourn Ally and fight back against transphobia and anti-trans violence,” Sgro told the AP.

All three teens are also charged with armed criminal action and abandonment of a corpse. They are being held without bond.

It is not clear if they have attorneys.

"Kevin Janson Neal, who on Tuesday went on a killing spree that left four people dead and 10 injured in northern California, also shot and killed his wife the prior night, officials say.

Neal, 44, fatally shot his wife late Monday, Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston said at a press conference Wednesday. The next day, he went on a shooting spree that included an attack on a local elementary school in Rancho Tehama Reserve, California. Police ultimately shot and killed him.

Authorities found the body of Neal’s wife, whose name has not been released, concealed in the floor at the shooter’s home.

“We’re confident that he murdered her ― shot her at some point late probably Monday, and literally put her body in the floor and covered her up,” Johnston told reporters.

The gunman’s killing of his wife fits a troubling pattern. A recent HuffPost investigation found that in 59 percent of mass shootings between 2015 and early November 2017, the perpetrator killed an intimate partner or family member during the massacre or had a history of domestic violence.

Following Tuesday’s shooting, neighbors told authorities they’d heard what sounded like a domestic violence situation on Monday, but had not called in a report to the sheriff’s office. Neighbors said they had heard yelling and gunshots on previous occasions.

Neal, who was out on bail for assault with a deadly weapon, called his mother late Monday.

“Mom it’s all over now,” he reportedly told his mother. “I have done everything I could do and I am fighting against everyone who lives in this area.”

One of his guns, a semiautomatic weapon that fired multi-round clips, was illegally manufactured by the shooter himself at his home, according to Johnston.

“He can get parts through a variety of sources, and they come together and they can build them in their shop or in their garage,” Johnston said.

The assistant sheriff also reported that the two handguns recovered were not owned under Neal’s name.

When asked if there’d been any attempts to recover guns from Neal’s home after his arrest and numerous complaints from neighbors, Johnston described Neal as “not law-enforcement friendly.”

“He would not come to the door,” Johnston said. “Actually, his house was arranged in a way that we couldn’t detect him being there, and on at least two occasions, officers put the house under surveillance hoping he would come back out.”

Authorities have no clear motive yet in the case.

“You have to understand, this individual was going down the street picking targets,” Johnston told reporters.

Neal’s attack on Rancho Tehama Elementary School did not kill any children, but did injure seven students with wounds ranging from minor to life-threatening. One child who was shot at the school is still in critical condition.

Johnston called the school’s lockdown “monumental” in saving lives, as the shooter was unable to get inside, became frustrated and left to find other targets.",1

In a horrifying hate crime, a gay couple in the Netherlands were attacked by a vicious group of men and youths with bolt cutters.

NL Times writes that Jasper Vernes-Sewratan and Ronnie Sewratan-Vernes were holding hands and walking home from a dance party in Arnhem early on Sunday. The couple claim they don’t usually hold hands in public, but they were alone and it was dark.

But as they were crossing the Nelson Mandela Bridge, the pair were accosted by a group of six to eight men.

Jasper told RTL Nieuws, “I think they were Moroccans. They began to shout: disgusting, dirty, homo, such things. We shouted something back and walked on, but all of a sudden they came after us.”

Tensions escalated into a shoving match, according to a post Jasper later wrote on Facebook.

Then, Jasper said, he saw a man pulling a pair of bolt cutters out of his jacket, and he heard his partner screaming that his teeth had been knocked out.

The couple managed to call an ambulance and were taken to the hospital, where doctors reattached Ronnie’s lip.

Jasper later posted about the event on Facebook:

He wrote:

[Ronnie’s] upper lip has one laceration, and he has lost 4 front teeth and partly a 5th tooth from the cutters, the lip is now in the hospital but the teeth are a bigger problem and need to be reset. What a nice date night was has become a nightmare. That this can still happen in 2017 is incomprehensible and hard to understand because in the end, we are just Dutch in our own country, but it can’t be like that, apparently, because of homosexuality.

Dutch police have arrested a 20 year-old man and a 14 year-old boy in connection with the incident, but the other attackers are still at large.

The hooks can penetrate heavy jackets and jeans and suspects ride the volt for an excruciating 5 seconds per hit. The bigger they are, the more effective the charge. Tasers are used to restrain criminal suspects and can stop them from fleeing police custody – the darts shoot out on wires that run 25 feet. Every officer on the force carries one, except parking control. Houselog showed a Powerpoint demonstration on tasers (complete with clips from the Hangover) that sparked giggles around the classroom. Then, it was time for the live demonstration. Sumner Sgt. Jeff Engle had never been tased, so he wanted to experience it before he retires, he said. He wore a white SUMNER COPS T-shirt to show off the blood he expected to spurt from his back and stood on a wrestling mat -- just in case. Then, the shot. To be honest, I dont know what Jeff said when he fell. I played it back 100 times and still cant figure it out. So, I leave it up to you to interpret. Please watch responsibly. Download the movie",0
"‘Harmless and exempt from’ FERPA

A public university in Maryland is refusing to provide any information about two students investigated for allegedly harassing and assaulting Jewish fraternity members, claiming it would violate federal law.

The fraternity itself refuses to say anything about the alleged assailants, suggesting that they do not fit the stereotype of white nationalists or neo-Nazis.

In contrast to the University of Maryland’s reaction to the murder of a black student – including the creation of a “rapid-response team” to respond to bias reports – Towson University (below) is eager to downplay the Alpha Epsilon Pi incident as isolated.

A media lawyer questioned Towson’s excuse for silence, telling The College Fix that “basic demographic information is recognized as being harmless and exempt from” the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.

‘Deplorable but isolated incident’

Two AEPi members were walking to the fraternity house near campus April 29 when they were reportedly harassed by two fellow students with profanity and racial slurs, including “fuck the Jews,” according to The Baltimore Sun. They were followed to their house, where one member was reportedly punched in the face.

Towson President Kim Schatzel released a statement regarding the “deplorable” assault, saying the university “does not tolerate acts of hatred” and that “any student found responsible for such conduct is subject to sanctions including suspension and expulsion from the university.”

Schatzel gave “my deepest assurances that these events will be treated with the utmost urgency by me and the Towson University administration.”

The university was put on the defensive by a Sun editorial that said Towson was “home to its own little corner of the white nationalist movement” – the White Student Union, which patrolled campus to report black-on-white crime several years ago – and suggested the AEPi attack could represent “a pattern of hate.”

In a joint statement in response, Schatzel and Baltimore Jewish Council Director Howard Libit said the attack “represents a deplorable but isolated incident” and they “do not believe a pattern of hate exists at TU.”

The AEPi incident is not listed on the university police’s crime log for April, all but two incidents of which are marked as “on campus.” One is marked “public property,” and the other, a fraudulent card transaction.

Towson’s Office for Inclusion and Institutional Equity defines “hate crime” as a “criminal offense committed against a person(s) or property which is motivated … by the offender’s bias towards the actual or perceived group member(s).”

For hate crimes, Towson students can “be punished with fines and/or imprisonment” after the crime is investigated by this office, police, residential staff, and the Office of Student Conduct and Civility Education. The equity office did not respond to requests from The Fix about whether it will release non-identifying information about the investigated students.

Fraternity won’t talk: Not its ‘right and responsibility’

Investigations by both Towson and the Baltimore County Police Department have now been closed, with neither revealing the identities of the alleged assailants. AEPi chose not to press charges against them.

AEPi spokesperson Jonathan Pierce told The Fix in an email the fraternity will neither identify the investigated students nor provide non-identifying information about them, because it does not “feel that that is our right and our responsibility to release.” Instead, the fraternity feels that it is for the “University and/or local authorities to release.”

When it announced the conclusion of the investigation, a spokesperson told the Sun that FERPA “restricts TU from disclosing the results of that investigation” but that both Towson “and the victims believe the process has yielded a fair result.”

Schatzel’s office did not respond to email inquiries from The Fix regarding the investigation or the decision not to share the alleged assailants’ identities or any other information about them.

Ray Feldmann, director of communications and media relations, also failed to return several phone calls and emails from The Fix seeking non-identifying demographic information about the assailants, such as their race, ethnicity or membership in particular groups or religious affiliations. Among Fix questions: whether such demographic information might inadvertently reveal the identity of the investigated students.

The Fix also requested public records from the Baltimore County Police Department media relations office on the hate-crime investigation and the alleged assailants, but has yet to receive the records.

‘All of that stuff should be publicly accessible regardless’

FERPA specifically allows colleges to give out “directory” information on students, and that includes demographics such as race and ethnicity, according to Frank LoMonte, former head of the Student Press Law Center and current head of the University of Florida’s Brechner Center for Freedom of Information.

The question in every FERPA judgment call is whether the situation, “including the identities of the students, [is] already so well-known beyond the students’ inner circle that the facts of the case cannot be released without unmistakably pointing to identifiable students,” LoMonte told The Fix in an email.

The “gray area” of student privacy law relates to the subjects of a “disciplinary investigation,” he said.

A school can confirm basic information about students if their names are already known. “[If] the suspects are Joe Jones and Tom Smith and you just say, ‘I’d like to know whether Joe and Tom are students here and what fraternity they belong to and what they’re majoring in,’” LoMonte said, “all of that stuff should be publicly accessible regardless of the existence of the disciplinary investigation.”

"During a speech delivered in Saudi Arabia on Sunday, President Donald Trump told Muslims to Drive out the terrorists. Drive out the extremists. Drive them out of your places of worship.

There is no question that terrorist groups representing a perverted form of Islam have caused mayhem and destruction. This weeks heinous bombing in Manchester, England, that killed 22 people is one glaring example — although its worth noting that most of the violence committed by ISIS and similar groups has been directed against their fellow Muslims. (Its not yet clear whether the Manchester perpetrator had any significant connection to militant groups in the Arab or Muslim world.)

But Trump and too many other Americans are often silent when it comes to the terrorists and extremists in their own country.

In the United States, right-wing domestic terrorists have killed hundreds of people since 2007. Moreover, federal law enforcement and other agencies have repeatedly warned that terrorism by right-wing extremists affiliated with the sovereign citizens movement, white supremacists and other hate groups poses a greater threat than violence by Islamic terrorists. Since Sept. 11, 2001, more people have been killed and injured in the United States by white right-wing domestic terrorists than Muslim extremists.

The Southern Poverty Law Center has also documented a record increase in hate crimes against Jews, Muslims and people of color that began with the start of Donald Trumps presidential campaign and has continued through the first months of his presidency.

Last Saturday Richard Collins III, a 23-year old African-American college student and newly commissioned U.S. Army lieutenant, was stabbed to death in an apparently random attack at the University of Maryland campus.

The accused killer is a white man named Sean Urbanski, who was apparently a member of an online white supremacist group called Alt Reich Nation. The university police chief, David Mitchell, described it this way: When I looked at the information that’s contained on that website, suffice to say that it’s despicable. It shows extreme bias against women, Latinos, members of the Jewish faith, and especially African-Americans. . . . Which brings up questions as to the motive in this case. Knowing that, we will continue to look for digital evidence, among other items of evidentiary value.”

As reported by The Daily Beast, BuzzFeed and other sources, Urbanski was apparently a Trump supporter who commented upon and upvoted racist, nativist and anti-Muslim posts and memes in various online forums.

Apparently, Trumps commands to drive out the terrorists and extremists apply in distant Muslim-majority nations of the Middle East but not to white people in the United States.

This act of probable racial terrorism occurred during a political moment when the safety and security of black and brown Americans is under threat from their own government.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions has actively worked to limit the voting and other civil rights of African-Americans and other people of color.

Trumps administration has removed white supremacist groups from the list of terrorist organizations tracked by the federal government under the Countering Violent Extremism program. His proposed 2018 federal budget totally eliminates this program, thus further freeing domestic terrorists to act without fear of consequences.

Trumps closest advisers and confidants include right-wing extremists such as Steve Bannon and Michael Anton, who appear to believe that the United States should be a white Christian country and that Muslims specifically and nonwhites more generally are alien outsiders who are a threat to Americas true values and identity.

As more details emerge about Urbanskis alleged killing of Collins, an obvious and tedious script will be followed by too many voices in the mainstream American news media and by white America as a whole.

There will be a focus on Urbanskis state of mind and how he was drunk or confused and perhaps suffered from a mental illness. He will, of course, be described as a lone wolf and a person whose behavior is not indicative of the centuries-long tradition of white-on-black racial violence in America. If they even dare to mention the murder of Richard Collins III, the right-wing propaganda machine will find some way to insist that Urbanski is actually a liberal or a progressive.

Because Sean Urbanski is a white man, certain questions will not be asked. Who radicalized him? What types of news media did he watch, read and listen to? Is there a moral leadership crisis in White America? What is going on in the homes and communities of the white people who join right-wing hate groups or who find themselves attracted to the white supremacist and white nationalist alt-right movement?

Trump and his administration will either choose to be silent on the killing of Richard Collins III or, as they have done in the past, will issue a mealymouthed and reluctant condemnation of such crimes. To do otherwise would risk alienating some of Trumps most enthusiastic supporters and closest advisers. Writing in The Nation, David Zirin located the murder of Collins within a broader national context, writing of his assailant:

He was not an interloper or an outsider. He is a homegrown terrorist who grew out of the soil of this college campus. The sooner that the administration and the student body reckon with that reality, the better. The UMD campus has seen racist chalkings, nooses, flyers, and threats since Donald Trump took office. And yes, one would have to be willingly obtuse to not see a direct line from having open white supremacists in the Oval Office to the emboldening of the perpetrators — not just at UMD but, according to NPR reporting, at campuses across the country.

Unfortunately, Richard Collins III will not be the last victim of violence, thuggery and murder at the hands of white hatemongers in Donald Trumps America. Trumps presidency has inaugurated a bloody season.

During the 2016 presidential campaign Donald Trump promised to “take care of our African-American people.” It would seem that his most racist white supporters are trying to follow through on Trumps thinly veiled and poorly disguised threat.

We should certainly mourn the victims of the horrific crime in Manchester, and we must remain vigilant about the particular dangers posed by Islamist violence. All Americans, however, must also be mindful and vigilant of the real and significant danger posed by white right-wing Christian domestic terrorists in the United States. Murder, hatred and intimidation are the common currency of all terrorists around the world, regardless of what God they claim to pray to or which political banner they fly.",1
"LOS ANGELES (CNS) - The operators of seven alleged sham pop-up medical clinics and a Glendale-based criminal defense attorney were among a dozen defendants arrested Thursday on federal drug trafficking charges that accuse them of diverting at least 2 million prescription pills -- including oxycodone and other addictive narcotics -- to the streets. Two indictments returned late last month by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles allege that members of the conspiracy profited from illicit prescriptions that were issued without any legitimate medical purpose through a series of clinics that periodically opened and closed in a pop-up style. The alleged fraudulent prescriptions allowed the conspirators to obtain bulk quantities of prescription drugs that were sold on the street, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office. Those arrested include Minas Matosyan, an Encino man also known as Maserati Mike, who is charged with leading the scheme and controlling six of the sham clinics. Matosyan allegedly hired corrupt doctors who allowed the conspirators to issue fraudulent prescriptions under their names in exchange for kickbacks. The two indictments charge 14 defendants who allegedly participated in an elaborate scheme they mistakenly hoped would conceal a high-volume drug trafficking operation, said acting U.S. Attorney Sandra R. Brown. In addition to generating illicit profits, this scheme helped drive the prescription drug epidemic that is causing so much harm across our nation. The indictments and search warrants describe how Matosyan would allegedly rent out recruited doctors to sham clinics in exchange for kickbacks derived from proceeds generated when the other bogus clinics created fraudulent prescriptions or submitted fraudulent bills to health care programs. In one example described in court documents, Matosyan allegedly provided a corrupt doctor to a clinic owner in exchange for $120,000. When the clinic failed to pay the money and suggested instead that Matosyan take back the corrupt doctor, Matosyan demanded his money and said, Doctors are like underwear to me. I dont take back used things, according to the document. In a recorded conversation also described in court papers, Matosyan allegedly discussed how one doctor was paid for sitting at home, while thousands of narcotic pills were prescribed in that physicians name and Medicare was billed more than $500,000 for purported patient care. The conspirators also allegedly stole the identities of doctors who refused to participate in the scheme. In an intercepted telephone conversation described in court documents, Matosyan allegedly offered a doctor a deal to sit home making $20,000 a month doing nothing. When the doctor refused the offer, the conspirators nevertheless created prescription pads in the doctors name and allegedly began selling fraudulent prescriptions for oxycodone without the doctors knowledge or consent. According to court documents, the conspirators also issued prescriptions and submitted bogus billings in the name of a doctor who at the time was hospitalized and later died. For the sake of mere profit, the operators of these medical clinics spewed deadly prescription drugs onto our streets, said Christian J. Schrank, special agent in charge for the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The opioid epidemic gripping this country is well documented and our communities in the Los Angeles area have been impacted, he said. Too often those ill-gotten gains came at the expense of innocent Americans. The indictment also charges Matosyan and others -- including defense attorney Fred Minassian -- with obstruction of justice for allegedly creating fraudulent medical records in an effort to deter the investigation. After a load of Vicodin was seized from one of the conspiracys major customers, Matosyan allegedly oversaw the creation of fake medical paperwork in an effort to make it appear the drugs had been legitimately prescribed. The indictment describes intercepted conversations in which the lawyer allegedly strategized on how to deceive law enforcement, which included a plan to bribe a doctor to lie to authorities. A woman who answered the telephone at Minassians office said nobody was immediately available to comment on the allegations against the lawyer. The 12 defendants arrested Thursday are: -- Matosyan, 36, of Encino, who is accused of leading the scheme by recruiting corrupt doctors, overseeing the theft of other doctors identities, and negotiating the sale of fraudulent prescriptions and narcotic pills; -- Armen Simonyan, 52, of Burbank, who allegedly managed the operations at some of the fraudulent clinics; -- Grisha Sayadyan, 66, of Burbank, who allegedly managed the operations at various clinics and sold oxycodone and Vicodin pills directly to black market customers; -- Sabrina Guberman, 45, of Encino, who, while working at the sham clinics, allegedly lied to pharmacies seeking to verify the fraudulent narcotic prescriptions, which included creating and sending fake medical paperwork; -- Frederick Manning Jr., 47, of Santa Ana, allegedly one of the major drug customers of the clinics, who is charged with agreeing to purchase as many as 1,000 pills per week of narcotics from Matosyan; -- Minassian, 50, of Glendale, the attorney who allegedly spearheaded the scheme to lie to law enforcement by making it falsely appear that Vicodin seized from Frederick Manning Jr. had been legitimately prescribed by a doctor; -- Ralph Manning, 49, of North Hills -- no relation to Frederick Manning Jr. -- who is charged with being one of the principal couriers Matosyan used to deliver fraudulent prescriptions and quantities of narcotic pills; -- Hayk Matosyan, 30, of Granada Hills, Matosyans brother, who allegedly filled fraudulent narcotic prescriptions at pharmacies and sold the resulting narcotics pills to black-market customers; -- Marisa Montenegro, 54, of West Hills, who allegedly filled fraudulent prescriptions; -- Elizabeth Gurumdzhyan, 25, of Hollywood, who allegedly filled fraudulent prescriptons; -- Anait Guyumzhyan, 27, of Hollywood, who allegedly filled prescriptions for oxycodone and returned the drugs to Matosyan-operated clinics in exchange for cash payment; and -- James Wilson, 54, of Venice, who alone is charged in the second indictment with illegally selling oxycodone prescriptions out of a Long Beach clinic that he controlled. The dozen defendants were expected to be arraigned on the indictment Thursday afternoon in Los Angeles federal court. Authorities are continuing to seek two named defendants: Gary Henderson, 62, of Lancaster, who allegedly purchased fraudulent oxycodone prescriptions from Matosyan; and an unidentified conspirator known only by the name Cindy. All of the defendants face significant terms in federal prison if they are convicted. For example, if convicted of the nine counts in which he is charged, Matosyan would face up to 165 years in prison, prosecutors noted. City News Service; Photo: Shutterstock",0

My Turn: Hate crimes are message crimes. Arizona can do more to send its own message against hate.

When hate comes out of the shadows, speak up. (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)

Hate crimes are a fact of life. This admission is a dreadful reality.

We read about them in newspapers and online. We hear about them on the radio or when talking with co-workers. Too frequently, these horrific crimes and incidents committed are anti-gay, anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim or anti-immigrant.

The sad fact is that today, one hate crime is committed in America every 90 minutes.

Theres a family behind every statistic

The conversation around hate crimes, whether it’s about an incident or pending legislation, is deeply personal.

Behind every statistic is a face, a family, a community. The damage done by hate crimes cannot be measured solely in terms of physical injury or dollars.

Hate crimes intimidate other members of the victims community, leaving them feeling isolated, vulnerable and unprotected by the law. These crimes merit a priority response because of their special impact on the victim and the victims community.

Just this Fourth of July, a Jewish family in Phoenix came home from a trip to find their mail box vandalized with a spray-painted swastika. A neighbor attempted to cover it. But there was no covering the intended message of hate.

Our ADL regional office in Arizona responded, as did the Phoenix Police Department. Equally importantly, the community responded by supporting this family and proving that love is greater than hate by joining them in painting messages of peace on the mail box.

Hate crimes are underreported

CLOSE Phoenix activists hosted a peace vigil in a show of solidarity against hate and racism at a white-nationalist event in Charlottesville, Va. Michael Chow/The Republic

Unfortunately, this is far from an isolated incident. According to the FBI’s hate crime statistics, Arizona reported a total of 276 hate crimes in 2015: 162 motivated by race, 57 by sexual orientation, 52 by religion and five by disability.

Although these numbers may seem shocking, it is important to realize that, historically, there is underreporting of hate crimes. It is likely that even this number does not represent the true scope of bias motivated crimes in Arizona.

MORE: Are you a victim of a hate crime? Fill out this form

For more than three decades, ADL has spearheaded the drafting, enactment and implementation of hate crime laws, working in partnership with other civil rights and religious organizations, law enforcement groups, civic agencies and business leaders.

Today, the federal government and 45 states and the District of Columbia have their own hate crime laws. We have had considerable success, but we need to do more.

The shooting in Charleston, S.C. – a state without a hate crime law – prompted ADL to rally partners in a renewed push to strengthen hate crime laws around the country. We call it the 50 States Against Hate campaign.

The campaign will help ensure that everyone in America will benefit from the legal protections of hate crime laws – and expect law enforcement and community support if they are the victims of hate-inspired violence.

Arizona should strengthen its law

Now we need to work together to enhance training for law enforcement on hate crime identification, response and reporting; to improve data collection and reporting; to educate communities about effective responses to hate violence to help build trust and advance police-community relations; and to raise awareness about the very serious issue of hate crime.

Unfortunately, there are no quick, complete solutions to these problems. State and local governments have an indispensable role to play in confronting bias motivated crimes. Effective and timely responses to hate violence by public officials and law enforcement authorities can play an essential role in deterring and preventing these crimes.

Currently, Arizona does not have a standalone criminal violation for hate crimes.

We should change that – and fortify existing state law to be more inclusive and comprehensive covering hate crimes based on race, religion, ethnicity/ national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and disability.

Hate crimes are message crimes. Arizona can send its own message: there’s no place for hate.

"UPDATED with correct number of the value of heroin: Authorities seized more than $14,500 in heroin during a Northport traffic stop and arrested a local heroin dealer during two separate drug busts this month, Northport Police say. A traffic stop in Northport led to the discovery of a large amount of heroin in a Middle Island mans car Saturday afternoon, police say. According to authorities, a Northport officer pulled over a 2015 Nissan for a traffic violation on Scudder Avenue at 2:35 p.m. when the officer noticed powder on the floor by the drivers feet and drug packaging materials throughout the car. It was also determined the license of the driver, identified as 26-year-old John Talavera, was suspended, police say. A subsequent investigation allegedly recovered 730 decks of heroin packaged for sale, 36 grams of loose heroin in a bag, $2,450 in cash, a hypodermic needle and assorted drug packing supplies. Police Officer Gregory Cerar conducted the traffic stop. Earlier this month, an East Northport man was arrested following the discovery of heroin, cash and drug paraphernalia inside his home during the execution of a search warrant, police say. Authorities were tipped off that Michael Larosa, 36, of Meadow Haven Lane, was allegedly selling heroin from his home, which spurred an investigation over a several-month period. Police say they observed Larosa participate in numerous drug transactions at his home and officers bought heroin from him on two occasions at the same location. A search warrant was executed at Larosas home on Tuesday, Aug. 10 at 6 a.m., and authorities allegedly seized: Larosa was arrested that same day and was charged with two counts of third-degree criminal sale of a controlled substance, third-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance (intent to sell), fourth-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance, seventh-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance and two counts of second-degree criminally using drug paraphernalia. Larosa was arraigned in First District Court in Central Islip and posted $15,000 bail. Talavera was charged with first-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance, third-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance (intent to sell), third-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance, criminal possession of a hypodermic instrument, second-degree criminally using drug paraphernalia, third-degree aggravated unlicensed operation, disobey stop sign, failed to signal a turn, uninspected vehicle and uninsured vehicle. Talavera was arraigned in Northport Village Justice Court. Bail was set at $39,300 bond or $19,650 cash, and he is being held at the Suffolk County Jail in Riverhead.

"Hate marches that took place across the U.S. drew violence between white supremacists and counterprotesters on Saturday, leading to several arrests.

The “March Against Sharia” took place in cities including St. Paul, Minnesota, Seattle, Washington, and New York City. The marches attracted Islamophobic hate group members, neo-Nazis and white supremacists ― all to rally against the completely nonexistent threat of Sharia law in the U.S.

The rallies were spearheaded by Act for America, described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as an anti-Muslim hate group.

In Seattle, fights broke out between hate group members and anti-fascists ― or Antifa ― supporters.

Former teacher Derek Weimer has said Fields was fascinated in high school with Nazism, idolized Adolf Hitler and had been singled out by officials at his Union, Kentucky, school for deeply held radical convictions on race.

"By Gregory Kyriakakis State officials are seeking to revoke an area physicians ability to prescribe drugs after he pleaded guilty in New York to conspiring to sell steroids. The state Attorney Generals Office announced Monday that it is taking action against five New Jersey doctors, including Richard Lucente who practiced in Middletown and Staten Island. Lucente entered a guilty plea in 2010 after authorities charged he conspired to illegally sell anabolic steroids and testosterone to patients in New York, taking kickbacks from a Brooklyn pharmacy when the prescriptions were filled there, according to the Attorney Generals Office. Doctors who make the decision to sell [controlled dangerous substance] prescriptions are a disgrace [to] their profession and their violated oath to do no harm, Acting Attorney General John J. Hoffman said in a statement. Authorities said this activity occurred between December 2004 and September 2007. Lucente was sentenced to five years probation and 200 hours of community service. The New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners revoked Lucentes license to practice in 2010, two months after his guilty plea. One patient, a New York bodybuilder, was given steroids and growth hormone despite having undergone a heart transplant, according to NJ.com. That man later died of heart failure following surgery, and New York medical officials said the drugs likely played a role. New Jersey is fighting back against prescribers who contribute to Americas drug epidemic, and working to protect the public should they ever again be reinstated to practice medicine in our state, Hoffman said. The revocation of a CDS registration is an extra layer of protection to the public, according to the Attorney Generals Office, since a doctor who has a license to practice restored still must ask the state Board of Medical Examiners to reinstate the registration. Lucente and the other doctors have been issued Orders to Show Cause why their CDS registrations should not be revoked, with hearing dates in about 45 days from now, according to the Attorney Generals Office. Prior to that, the doctors must explain in writing why they should be able to keep that privilege.",0

‘Hate crime’ charge against Spanish archbishop dismissed

August 09, 2017

A Spanish court has dismissed a complaint against Archbishop Francisco Javier Martinez of Granada, who had been accused of “hate crime” after he delivered a sermon against gender theory.

A local prosecutor said that he did not find reason to prosecute the archbishop, turning down a complaint by gender activists that the prelate had “promoted hate” in his homily.

New Legislation Would Classify Inciting to Riot and Rioting That Targets Protected Classes as Offenses to the States Hate Crimes Law.

Albany, NY - August 15, 2017 - In the aftermath of the violent and deadly events in Charlottesville this past weekend, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced he will be advancing legislation to add the crimes of inciting to riot and rioting that targets protected classes to the list of specified offenses under the states hate crimes law. These legislative changes, known as the Charlottesville provisions, will reaffirm that while peaceful demonstrations are allowed, New York will never tolerate advocacy or the incitement of imminent violence against protected classes within our communities.

The ugly events that took place in Charlottesville must never be repeated, and in New York were going to stand united against hate in all of its forms, Governor Cuomo said. Our diversity is our strength and this legislation will help protect New Yorkers and send a clear signal that violence and discrimination have no place in our society. New York is one community and one family, and we will never stop fighting to ensure the safety and equal treatment of all New Yorkers.

Additionally, the Governor once again called for an expansion of the states Human Rights Law to protect all students statewide. Under current law, only private school students are protected by the Human Rights law, meaning that if a public school student is discriminated against in school, that student has no claim.

The Charlottesville Provisions

Under state law, a person commits a hate crime when one of a specified set of offenses is committed targeting victims because of a perception or belief about their race, color, national origin, ancestry, gender, religion, religious practice, age, disability or sexual orientation, or when such an act is committed as a result of that type of perception or belief. Hate crimes can be perpetrated against an individual, a group of individuals or against public or private property. Under the Governors proposal, the Hate Crimes Law would be amended to add inciting to riot and rioting, when directed at a protected class, to the list of specified offenses punishable as a hate crime. The penalties for engaging in rioting would be increased from an E felony to a D felony and inciting to riot would be increased from an A misdemeanor to an E felony.

Expanding the Human Rights Law

In addition to amending the Hate Crimes statute, the Governor is also calling on legislative action to amend the Human Rights Law to protect all public school students and institutions from discrimination. Following a 2012 decision by the New York State Court of Appeals that found public schools did not fit the definition of an education corporation or association, the State Division of Human Rights lost its ability to investigate reports of bullying, harassment, or other discrimination being made by public school students. This decision was made despite the fact that the Division had asserted jurisdiction over public schools for nearly three decades and was forced to dismiss over 70 open complaints filed against public schools at the time.

Governor Cuomo yesterday also signed legislation giving prosecutors more tools to combat hate by allowing prosecutors to increase penalties against those who make bomb threats against community centers.

In November 2016, Governor Cuomo announced during an address at Abyssinian Baptist Church several actions to protect civil rights and combat hate crimes in New York, including the creation of a State Police unit to investigate reports of hate crimes, an expansion of the states human rights law to protect all students, and the establishment of a new emergency legal defense fund for immigrants. The State Police have created a new hate crimes unit and Governor Cuomo launched the nations first public-private immigrant legal defense initiative called the Liberty Defense Project, but the State legislature has not yet passed legislation expanding the Human Rights Law.

Protecting Civil Rights and Combatting Hate Crimes

New Yorkers who have experienced bias or discrimination are encouraged to call DHRs toll-free hotline at (888) 392-3644 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday - Friday. If you want to report a crime or fear for your safety, call 911 immediately.

"MIAMI - The state has upgraded charges against four men accused of attacking a gay couple last month on South Beach following the Miami Beach Gay Pride Parade.

Under Floridas hate-crime enhancement law, the state charged each man Thursday with aggravated battery committed with prejudice.

Juan C. Lopez, Adonis Diaz, Pablo Romo-Figueroa, all 21, and Luis Alonso-Piovet, 20, each face up to 30 years in prison if they are convicted.

The victims, Dimitri Lugonov and Rene Chalarca, attended Thursdays hearing.

Dimitri Lugonov and Rene Chalarca attend a court hearing May 10 for the suspects accused of attacking them in South Beach.

The couple told police they were attacked by the group of men April 8 after they shared a hug while waiting to use a restroom at Lumus Park in the 500 block of Ocean Drive.

Chalarca and Lugonov said one of their attackers yelled an offensive Spanish word for homosexuals before hitting them several times.

I fell on the ground and somebody started beating me up. I didnt even see the faces, Logunov told Local 10 last month. It was that quick. He tried to protect me.

He hit him, and then I grabbed the guy, and he was already on the floor, and the other people came and started hitting him, Chalarca said.

According to a police report, a bystander who saw the attack and tried to intervene was pushed to the ground and suffered a cut to the back of his head.

We confronted the guys and asked them, What the hell? Why did you guys do that? Thats unfair. And thats all I remember, Helmut Estrada said.

Police said Chalarca and Lugonov had cuts and bruises on their faces and were treated by paramedics at the scene. Estrada was taken to Mount Sinai Medical Center for treatment.

"Two women allegedly vandalized a mosque in Tempe, Arizona while making disparaging remarks towards Muslims. Even worse, they had children with them. Oh yeah, and one of the women allegedly posted a video documentation of the incident to her Facebook page.

Tahnee Gonzales (whose profile picture is at the top of this story) and Elizabeth Dauenhauer were arrested on Thursday afternoon. Both women face felony burglary charges, according to Arizona Central, a local USA Today paper.

A video on Gonzales Facebook page on March 4 appears to show the women, in addition to three children, at the Islamic Community Center of Tempe. They allegedly steal pamphlets and brochures and encourage the kids to help them.

“Look at this mosque, this ugly mosque here,” a female voice says in the video. The same voice goes on to call Muslims “Satan-worshippers.” One of the children can be heard chiming in saying, “they smell goat.”

Before arriving at the mosque, the same woman can be heard saying look at this group of infidels. Then, cheering.

In the footage, the women claim they want to halt the infiltration of the Arabic Muslim coming in and destroying America.”

That video has since been taken down. In another video on Gonzales’s page from the same day, the children are in the back of the car holding up and waving American flags while a song blasts, “Build a wall.”

It is unclear if the women have lawyers who can speak on their behalf.

Based on the details of the crime, an enhancement of hate crime will be considered for sentencing, Detective Lily Duran, a Tempe Police Department spokeswoman told Arizona Central.

The Anti-Defamation League put out a statement about the incident, which reads in part: “Watching these videos is extremely disturbing and ugly on so many levels. It’s bad enough that these individuals felt emboldened to go to this mosque and threaten the security of those peacefully practicing their religion. But to involve young children and to indoctrinate them with their hate is abhorrent.

Sadly, the behavior we see in the videos is consistent with the growth in hate crimes, rise in attacks on Muslims, and the surge in anti-Muslim bigotry and anti-Semitism we have seen the last couple of years.”

PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) – A former Marine will spend the next 5 years on formal probation after being caught on camera during a disturbance inside a northeast Portland Iraqi restaurant.

On Friday, Damien Rodriguez pled guilty to attempted second-degree assault and second-degree intimidation. Under Oregon law, second-degree intimidation is considered a hate crime.

The owners of DarSalam told KOIN 6 News in April 2017 that they believed they were targeted simply because they have a Middle Eastern restaurant.

During the altercation, racial statements were made and Rodriguez picked up a chair and threw it toward staff, according to police.

Video from the incident shows other people attempting to restrain Rodriguez.

If Rodriguez violates any part of his formal probation, he could receive a 56-60 month prison sentence.

It is likely that Rodriguez will move down to California where he will pick up work and continue treatment for his mental health and post-traumatic stress disorder.

According to Multnomah County senior deputy district attorney Amity Girt, Rodriguez will have to pay a total of $21,000 in fines to the two victims. The fines break down to $11,000 and $10,000 respectively.

Rodriguez read an apology note in court. KOIN 6 News will include the full copy of the text once it is released.

Employees from DarSalam were not in court for Friday’s sentencing; however, they support the plea agreement.

Hate crime victims can use new free web application to get help

A screenshot of hatecrimehelp.com from CuroLegal.

CuroLegal has launched a free web application that helps victims and witnesses of hate crimes find help.

Hatecrimehelp.com was built in collaboration with Cisco Systems and the American Bar Association’s Center for Innovation, according to a press release.

Someone who believes they are the victim of a hate crime answers several questions, including the type of incident experienced and the location, even if it happens online. Based on the answers, the app generates information on how to contact local law enforcement and other government resources and nonprofits that may offer help. The app also offers comparisons between state and federal hate crime laws.

“In light of the increased reports of hate crimes in this country in recent months, our goal is to provide clarity on the law and available resources, and to appropriately set expectations for what help is available from those resources,” Nicole Bradick, CuroLegal’s chief strategy officer, said in a press release.

The application was inspired at a March design event at Suffolk University Law School, where the theme was responding to hate crimes through technology.

“At that event, we were able to do some rapid discovery and learning from all of the players that were assembled, and sketched out the critical path for the application,” Bradick said in an email. “The actual site design and development came from our team after the event.”",1

In the world of politics, what legislation is called unfortunately may matter more than what it’s intended to do.

Consider, for example, health care. Everyone wants health care to be affordable. So name a bill the “Affordable Health Care Act,” and some will immediately be on board. After all, who wants to be against affordable health care?

So it is with hate crimes. On its surface, the term “hate crimes” suggests that it is criminal to hate — and therefore what right-thinking person would oppose a bill targeting hate? In fact, anyone opposed to any bill called “hate crimes” should prepare to be accused of bigotry, racism and the like.

However, I believe Hoosiers will dig beyond the surface of what a bill is called and focus on what a bill is intended to fix.

As Shakespeare said, “What’s in a name?” No matter what you call it, “hate” is a horrible thing. Unquestionably, we need less of it. But is it something we should legislate?

“Hate” is an emotion, a belief, a thought. Although we can agree that hate is wrong and should be roundly discouraged, it has not been our nation’s practice to criminalize thought.

Our U.S. Constitution protects everyone’s right to think, believe and generally speak without fear of prosecution. We are even — or perhaps especially – free to share thoughts that may be unpopular or disagreeable.

Criminal statutes are designed to address wrongful conduct — actions taken by one person against another that infringe upon the other’s freedom. Our laws prohibit doing something bad. They do not prohibit thinking something bad.

So hate-crimes legislation that focuses on criminalizing hateful belief, speech or thought — while well intended — would be inconsistent with our existing standards for establishing criminal behavior.

But what of the hate that leads to or inspires harmful behavior? What of wrongful conduct that is the manifestation of hate?

Burning a cross is not just trespass or mischief. Spray-painting racial epithets is not just vandalism or defacing property. These acts are the very manifestation of hate. They are symbols, historically used, to send a broader message. That message? Violence is on the way! It is a message designed to strike panic and fear. It is a purposeful message to intimidate and terrorize its target.

Manifestations of hate that amount to wrongful actions deserve to be prohibited by law.

Hate can often ignite into nasty conduct. When it does, victims of this conduct often suffer both physically and emotionally. Certainly, it is worth considering the law’s place in guarding against conduct borne of hate.

But should some groups receive greater protection from hateful conduct than others? Designating specific groups to be “protected” necessarily implies the existence of other groups that are not. Although one might argue that certain groups merit protection over others, this argument oddly contradicts the very essence of equality that such protection is intended to ensure.

The protected class of race was established to guard against discriminatory practices that historically impacted blacks. But discriminating against someone solely because they are white is just as much a violation of the protected class of race – regardless that whites have not been determined to be the victims of long-term patterns of discrimination.

In Indiana, policymakers have extended protected-class status to groups such as felons and smokers — suggesting that the list of groups to single out could be limitless. Worse yet is that somebody gets to pick who it’s OK to hate and who it’s not.

Any group with an identifiable characteristic should qualify for protection. Blacks, whites, Asians, men, women, children, gays, lesbians, transgenders, heterosexuals — as well as police, military, Jews, Catholics, Muslims, blondes, redheads, men with freckles and so on.

In fact, we should stop making lists altogether. If it is appropriate to prohibit hateful conduct aimed at any group, then it is appropriate to prohibit hateful conduct aimed at all groups.

If we are to criminalize hateful conduct, then we cannot condemn hateful conduct against some and ignore hateful conduct against others.

Our laws may never be able to prevent people from harboring within their hearts hatred for other human beings, but our laws always can and should offer equal protection to all people — from injury, intimidation, threats and property crimes committed by any who would wish to do them harm.

"FAIRFIELD (CBS13) – A man is suspected of starting three small fires in Fairfield, including one right in front of the police department.

The incidents started late Thursday night. Fairfield police say a small propane canister was lit on fire and exploded in front of the police department’s windows.

Investigators believe the man also tried to do the same thing at an apartment complex along North Texas Street. He’s also suspected of trying to light a car on fire, police say.

Police say someone threw an incendiary device through and window and into an apartment around 10 p.m. Thursday. Two people were inside the apartment at the time.

Crews managed put out the fire and no one was hurt in the incident.

Later that night, authorities responded to a car fire on Thames Court.

Then, early Friday morning, the Fairfield Police Department’s lobby was hit.

The man, identified as 39-year-old Fairfield resident Matthew Scott Jones, was arrested near the original crime scene and is now booked at Solano County Jail.

Investigators say Jones had allegedly been acting erratically over the past month and had been hurling racial epithets at the two people who lived in the apartment where the first incendiary device was thrown.

"Package bombings that killed 2 seen as possible hate crimes, experts say

AUSTIN, Tx. - Three package bombings that killed two people and injured two others, all of them African-American or Hispanic, in Austin, Texas, may have been motivated by hate, authorities said.

Killed were a 17-year-old boy, an orchestral musician and essay contest winner, and a 39-year-old father, both of them African-American. A 75-year-old Hispanic woman was critically injured and an African-American woman in her 40s was also wounded in the explosions.

[RELATED: Friends remember victims of Austin package bombings]

“We are not ruling out hate,” Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said in a press conference this week of the bombings that occurred in an 11-day span this month. In an interview with ABC News, Manley speculated on possible motivations for the crimes: “Is this driven by an ideology? A philosophy? Is it driven by hate?”

If whoever planted the exploding packages is found to have been motivated by hate, the bombings will be part of a larger trend of an increase in hate crimes in the Texas capital. But experts suspect hate crimes overall are underreported in Texas, and federal and state data obtained by ABC News show very few suspects are ever convicted of hate crimes in the state.

TRENDING STORIES:

We don’t know for sure what the motivation is, not until the suspect is caught, questioned and prosecuted will we know that, cautioned Ryan Lenz, an investigative writer for the Southern Poverty Law Center, an anti-bigotry organization.

But he noted that with all of the package bombings apparently aimed at minority residents, There is the commonality of target.

Hate crimes in Texas appear underreported

Reports of hate crimes in Austin rose by 46 percent in 2016, but that is against the relatively small totals of 13 in 2015 and 19 in 2016, according to the FBI’s annual report on hate crimes. The city has Austin police have identified the people killed in two separate package explosions as Draylen Mason, left, and Anthony House. Mason died in a bombing Monday morning. House died after an explosion March 2. Kylie Phillips and Norrell Waynewood nearly 950,000 residents.

Statewide in Texas -- the nation’s second-most populous state with about 26.9 million residents -- the total number of reported hate crimes in 2016 was just 178, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety’s Texas Crime Report.

That fits the trend of roughly 200 hate crimes getting reported each year to law enforcement agencies in Texas, according to publicly-available Texas Crime Reports analyzed by ABC News.

But those numbers strike hate-crimes expert Brian Levin as suspiciously low for such a big state.

“Relative to its population, Texas reports fewer hate crimes than other big states,” said Levin, a criminologist and attorney who directs the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.

He noted that California -- which with 38.8 million residents is the only state bigger than Texas -- reported 931 hate crimes in 2016. New York, the nation’s fourth-most populous state with a population of 19.4 million reported 595 such crimes.

“Something is wrong when Texas, as a state, has fewer hate crimes than some of the major cities in the U.S.,” Levin said.

Texas had a rate of 0.7 hate crimes reported for every 100,000 residents, far lower than the rate of 3.1 for every 100,000 residents in New York and 2.4 for every 100,000 in California, using 2017 Census population figures.

It’s not just Texas.

Levin said law enforcement in Texas could do more to ensure officers recognize and investigate potential hate crimes.

Indeed, Texas does not mandate training for police officers on how to investigate potential hate crimes. Gretchen Gribsby with the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement confirmed.

In addition, Texas’ geography with its high numbers of people living in rural areas may partially explain why there are relatively few reports of hate crimes in the state, said Lenz of the Southern Poverty Law Center.

“Less densely populated areas tend to report fewer hate crimes,” Lenz said.

But he said Texas isnt alone in what he said is a general underreporting of such crimes.

”Hate crimes are wildly underreported, I mean, horrifically underreported,” Lenz said.

One reason may be that victims of hate crimes may be reluctant to report what happened, he said.

“Hate crimes likely aren’t being reported because victims fear law enforcement may not believe them or they may be embarrassed and not report to police at all for fear of putting a target on their home,” Lenz said.

Of the hate crimes reported in Texas, a small number go to court

Even among the relatively small number of incidents reported to police as hate crimes in Texas, a yet smaller number results in cases brought to court.

Since 2001, when Texas enacted its current hate-crime law, only in 26 instances was a hate-crime finding requested of the courts, according to the Texas Office of Court Administration.

And in only 23 of those instances did a judge or jury confirm them as hate crimes, according to Megan LaVoie of the Texas Office of Court Administration said.

So, while roughly 200 hate crimes are reported by Texas law enforcement agencies each year, over a 17-year period only 23 were confirmed by the courts as alleged hate crimes.

Experts believe that may be because the states hate-crime law -- called the Byrd Statute after James Byrd Jr., an African-American man who was dragged to his death behind a pickup truck by white supremacists in 1998 -- has strict limits.

The law, for example, doesnt allow for perpetrators to be found guilty of a hate crime on top of any other crime they committed. It also only allows judges or juries to impose harsher sentences for the hate crime if a prosecutor can prove a suspect was motivated by hate.

Proving motivation can be nearly impossible, Lenz said.

“Knowing the motivation of an assailant and being able to convince a jury that that motivation was the primary motivation in committing that crime is a pretty high hurdle for prosecutors,” Lenz said.

A criminal law professor in Texas agreed.

“It’s hard enough to prove some crimes beyond a reasonable doubt without adding another element like motive,” said Brian Serr, professor of criminal law and procedure at Baylor University. “Prosecutors have to decide, ‘Should I take on trying to prove this suspect committed a hate crime when I’m already putting a bad guy in jail for the actual crime committed?’”

Experts interviewed by ABC News also said few hate crimes may be tried in court simply because prosecutors may not want to try to prove hate was the suspect’s motive when it is easier to show simply that the suspect is guilty of the crime committed, as Lenz said.

That doesn’t mean perpetrators of hate crimes are walking free in Texas, Serr said.

“It’s not like a hate criminal is going to get off the hook if they aren’t prosecuted for a hate crime,” he said. “He’s getting the punishment he deserves without prosecutors having to go thru the process of proving motive.”

Exploding packages

The first package explosion occurred March 2, killing Anthony Stephan House, a 39-year-old father. Then two other packages blew up on March 12, one of them killing 17-year old Draylen Mason, a talented bass player who was set to enroll at the Butler School of Music at the University of Texas for the next year.

Investigators believe that the trio of bombs displayed a level of sophistication, indicating that the bomb-maker or bomb-makers were highly skilled.

The devices were set up to be detonated by motion like shaking or jostling, which is why they exploded when they were picked up. They also had some sort of safety switch, which enabled the bomber to move the devices without blowing themselves up, the sources briefed on the investigation told ABC News.",1
"CHICAGO (AP) — Authorities have charged a 45-year-old suburban Chicago man with a hate crime after prosecutors say he called a Muslim civil rights advocate and left a threatening message.

Prosecutors say Marvin Meyer of Oak Forest admitted calling the Council on American-Islamic Relations Chicago office and leaving a message for deputy director Sufyan Sohel. The message told the American-born attorney he wasnt welcome in the U.S. and made a death threat, among other things.

The Chicago Tribune reports (http://trib.in/2tgELxD) Meyer was charged with a felony count of a hate crime and a misdemeanor count of a telephone threat. Meyer has been ordered held on $75,000 bail and is required to wear an electronic monitoring device once released. A listed number for Meyer couldnt be located Sunday.

"A neo-Nazi site has come to the defense of the man police believe fatally stabbed two train passengers in Portland, Oregon, Friday.

Jeremy Joseph Christian, a 35-year-old who is known to local authorities as a white supremacist, has been charged with two counts of aggravated murder, along with other offenses, over the incident. Police say he shouted racial and religious insults at two women on the train, one of whom was wearing a hijab. When bystanders tried to intervene, Christian allegedly stabbed three of them. Two died, and the third victim is expected to survive.

But according to the founder of the Daily Stormer, which actively promotes anti-Semitic and racist viewpoints, Christian was probably “defending himself against attackers.” Andrew Anglin suggested that the victims assaulted Christian, though Portland police have said that at least two of the men attempted to calm him before he started slashing.

Anglin concluded his take by saying the women Christian was allegedly targeting shouldn’t have been in the country in the first place.

“Again, it has to be said: when our people attack their people (if that indeed is what happened), the reason is the same as when the opposite happens: it is because they are in our countries in the first place,” he wrote.

Handout . / Reuters Jeremy Joseph Christian, 35, of North Portland, Oregon.

The Southern Poverty Law Center sued Anglin last month for allegedly orchestrating an anti-Semitic campaign against Jewish residents of Whitefish, Montana. Anglin published the phone numbers and email addresses of multiple Jewish people in the area and encouraged readers “take action,” which prompted a torrent of threatening messages. He targeted the residents after learning that Sherry Spencer, the mother of alt-right figure Richard Spencer and a Whitefish business owner, was facing criticism over her son’s politics.

Anglin did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment.

Other right-wing sites and groups have offered their own takes on the attack. Conservative outlet The Daily Caller described Christian as “an anti-circumcision, Bernie Sanders supporter” based on comments on his Facebook page.

Christian indeed voiced support for Sanders and 2016 Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein. Those comments were interspersed with others espousing white supremacist views and praise for Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, as well as a frequent complaints about circumcision, according to Buzzfeed.

Jihad Watch’s Robert Spencer, whom the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as one of “America’s most prolific and vociferous anti-Muslim propagandists,” disagreed that Christian was distinctly anti-Muslim. The alleged attacker had disparaged Jews and Christians as well as Muslims aboard a different train the night before the stabbings, according to KOIN.

Portland killer ranted against Jews, Christians, and Muslims, media reported him as “Islamophobe” https://t.co/rnHi3tW9ju — Robert Spencer (@jihadwatchRS) May 29, 2017

FBI crime statistics show that hate crimes against Muslims rose 67 percent from 2014 to 2015, while hate crimes overall were up 6.7 percent during that timeframe. Muslims continued to be targeted during the 2016 election as well. During his campaign, Donald Trump called for a national Muslim database and suggested the mother of a fallen soldier was not allowed to speak because of her religion. After winning the presidency, he quickly tried to ban people from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.

In a message to HuffPost, Spencer denied that Islamophobia is a legitimate problem in the U.S.

”From his words he was clearly an equal opportunity hater. He harassed the Muslim women because they were there,” Spencer wrote of Christian. “You are emailing me because you want to shore up the fiction that Muslims are frequently the victims of hate crimes in the U.S.”

Ryan Mauro of the Clarion Project, which the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as “peddling anti-Muslim conspiracy theories,” gave his organization credit for denouncing Christian.

“We did our part at Clarion Project by covering the story, because we believe Islamist extremism and anti-Muslim extremist must both be tackled,” Mauro wrote to HuffPost. “Christian saw himself as a valiant warrior against jihadists, but he is a gift to jihadists.”

The Clarion Project’s article on the attack only alluded to anti-Muslim sentiment by mentioning that Christian had insulted a woman wearing a hijab. Like Spencer, Mauro focused on the alleged attacker’s wide range of bigoted comments.

“He was motivated by a stew of multiple hatreds and it would be wrong for the media and politicians to assign responsibility for this bloodshed to either party,” he wrote.

Ricky John Best and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, the two men who died in the stabbing, have been hailed as heroes who stood up to hate. “They were attacked because they did the right thing,” Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said Saturday.",1

"AUGUSTA — Maine’s high court last week ordered a lower court to explain why potential jail time for any future hate crimes he might commit would be justified for a Turner man convicted of twice ramming into the car of a man he believed was gay.

The Maine Supreme Judicial Court on Tuesday ordered Androscoggin County Superior Court to provide clear reasoning for issuing the “very broad and permanent injunction” against Ronald Champagne.

According to a court order filed in January, authorities say that Champagne yelled a gay slur at a man at a boat launch on Lake Auburn in March 2012. He then told the man he would ram his car into the lake before twice driving into the back of the man’s Subaru.

Last year, Champagne pleaded no contest to reckless conduct with a dangerous weapon and was sentenced to 18 months in prison with all but 14 days suspended, and a year of probation, the Bangor Daily News reported.

The Maine Attorney General’s Office also brought a civil rights case against Champagne under the state’s civil rights act. The office has argued for a court order warning that Champagne could face up to one year in jail if he commits future hate crimes against any group protected under Maine’s hate crimes law.

But Champagne’s attorney, Donald Hornblower, said the court’s order should limit Champagne only from threatening or using violence against individuals because of their sexual orientation.

“I pointed out it was overbroad and there was no evidence supporting” the order, Hornblower said. “A lifetime injunction against all these classes, it’s a very severe thing.”

In the opinion Tuesday, the supreme court justices said that such a comprehensive ban must be based on factual findings and evidence.

“Because the court did not make the required factual findings providing the basis for its injunction, we do not have a sufficient record for appellate review,” the justices said.

The justices said without such details, they can’t decide whether the court abused its discretion.

The Attorney General’s Office didn’t respond to a request for comment Friday.

"One of the vigils held in Portland on Saturday.

Two men were fatally stabbed and another wounded after being attacked by a man whom they confronted once he began yelling racist comments at two teenagers on a light-rail train in Portland, Oregon, on Friday. One of the teenagers was Muslim and wearing a hijab, while the other was black. Fifty-three-year-old Army veteran Ricky John Best, a father of four, died at the scene, while 23-year-old Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, a recent college graduate, died after being transported to a local hospital. A third man, 21-year-old Micah David-Cole Fletcher is recovering from serious wounds he received during the attack. All three men are being hailed as heroes.

The attacker, 35-year-old Jeremy Joseph Christian, fled the scene but was later arrested and is currently being held without bail on counts of aggravated murder, attempted murder, and other charges. Christian has previous convictions for felony robbery and felony kidnapping and seems to have been a white supremacist. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Christian’s social-media profile suggests he was “all over the political spectrum but indicates that he holds some racist and other extremist beliefs.” Christian was also recently seen using the N-word, shouting “Die Muslims!”, and giving Nazi salutes at a free-speech rally in Portland late last month.

Christian may now face federal hate-crime charges, though FBI special agent Renn Cannon told reporters on Saturday that it was “too early to say” whether the attack “was an act of domestic terrorism or a federal hate crime.”

Portland authorities and witnesses say that Christian “had been acting up the whole ride” while on a MAX light-rail train late Friday afternoon. Apparently, when Christian saw the two teenage girls, he approached them and launched into a diatribe of what “would best be characterized as hate speech toward a variety of ethnicities and religions” at the girls and others, according to police. The mother of one of the teenagers told reporters that one of the comments Christian made was that Muslims should die.

The three samaritans, Best, Namkai-Meche, and Fletcher, then tried to intervene in defense of the teens and calm Christian down, but he responded by attacking the men with a large knife, slashing their throats. Christian fled following the attack, and when confronted by police, tried to convince them to shoot him. He was taken into custody instead.

The two teenage girls, along with other passengers, ran from the train during the attack but were later identified and gave statements to police. The attack happened hours before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan began in the city, and Portland police have contacted Muslim leaders in the area to let them know there would be extra patrols to ensure they are protected. The local Muslim community has already raised nearly $200,000 to support the families of the victims, and additional online fundraising efforts are also underway.

Rick Best, 53, was a 23-year Army veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and had been working as a technician for the Portland Bureau of Development Services following his retirement from the military. The Oregon native leaves behind a wife and four teenage children.

Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, 23, had decided to remain in Portland after earning an economics degree from Reed College last year and getting a job at a local consulting firm. His family said in a statement that his enthusiasm was “infectious” and he had “lived a joyous and full life”:

We lost him in a senseless act that brought close to home the insidious rift of prejudice and intolerance that is too familiar, too common. He was resolute in his conduct (and) respect of all people. In his final act of bravery, he held true to what he believed is the way forward.

While in high school, 21-year-old Micah David-Cole Fletcher, whose injuries are not life threatening, won a poetry slam in 2013 in which he recited a poem speaking out against prejudice toward Muslims in America. Fletcher, who was traveling in between work and college classes at the time of the attack, has become a committed activist. “I was shocked it was him, but I wasn’t surprised it was him — I can’t see him not standing up,” a friend told Buzzfeed News regarding Fletcher’s involvement in the intervention.

"“To those white people that are seeing this, use this as an opportunity and wake up call to confront the privilege in your own life, wrote Jenny Lundt.

Sadly, we live in times where police officers can routinely discriminate against people of color and use excessive, sometimes even lethal, force yet manage to get away scot free, whereas an African American student who someone assumed was holding a weapon could shut down an entire university, leaving thousands scared for their lives.

In yet another display of systemic racism, a black student at Colgate University, a private liberal arts college in Hamilton, New York, induced panic among his peers and faculty by carrying a hot glue gun on campus. The administration immediately asked its students to take shelter and word spread there were two gunmen on campus, and one had committed suicide.

None of it turned out to be true.

The entire ordeal must have been traumatic for many, particularly the minority students, which is why the incident prompted a sophomore to share a social media post demonstrating her white privilege and how institutionalized racism continues to be a major problem.

In her now-viral Facebook post, Jenny Lundt not just talked about the phenomenon but actually went a step ahead and shared her own picture, which showed her carrying a sharp metal sword, to explain how racial profiling works.

This is me, only one year ago on this very campus, running around the academic quad with a f****** sharp metal sword,” she began. “People thought it was funny. People laughed — oh look at that harmless, silly white girl with a giant sword!”

Lundt then talked about how “limited information” didnt just shut down her college for over four hours, it also put “all black men on this campus in danger and at risk of being killed.”

“That is the reality of the institutionalized racism in the United States. If you think for even a second this wasnt profiling, ask yourself why this sword is still in my room and has not ONCE made anyone uncomfortable,” she continued. “No one has EVER called the police on me. Understand that there are larger forces at play than this one night, and this one instance of racism. This is engrained in our university and our larger society.”

Once her post started drawing attention, the student decided to use her internet fame to educate white people how they can take a stand against the plague of racial discrimination.

“To those white people that are seeing this, use this as an opportunity and wake up call to confront the privilege in your own life, she wrote. Have these conversations and find the own swords in your life... things you could get away with that your friends of color could not. There are many white people on this post trying to suppress the voices of others with comments such as all lives matter or white privilege doesnt exist. CHALLENGE THAT. fight back. And not just on this post, but in real life. Challenge racist jokes. Challenge stereotypes and hold your white friends accountable.”

It was a great effort on Lundt’s part and drew many positive reactions.

white people using their privilege to educate, a concept! pic.twitter.com/6ugbTtxSOH — con(no)r (@ctfuconnor) May 12, 2017

However, some not only disagreed with her statement but also challenged the existence of white privilege.

Some people of color were also — and rightfully so — upset that others only started responding to the issue of white privilege after a white person wrote about it.

Lundt later updated her post to share the words of a Sahil Gadhavi, who published an open letter addressed to her.

Where is this over-pouring of attention when black children are being shot by the police everyday, while your own white children are being raised in the ignorance afforded by their skin? he asked. Where is this praise when black activists march up and down the city squares all over the country screaming black lives matter and all they hear back is all lives matter?

According to a report published in American Journal of Public Health, police are nearly three times more likely to kill black men than their white counterparts.

"GLENDORA, CA — No matter where you are celebrating, its time to think ahead and make sure you get home safely. Kickoff on Americas favorite pastime is just about ready to start. For many football fans, when its time for Super Bowl LII, everyones a fan…and Fans Dont Let Fans Drive Drunk. The California Highway Patrol and Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department, Orange County Sheriffs Department and other local law enforcement agencies are huddling up with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for a special Fans Dont Let Fans Drive Drunk reminder to urge football fans across the nation not to drop the ball on this issue. In all states, drivers are considered alcohol-impaired if they have a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .08 or higher. Drunk driving can be deadly, and even small amounts of alcohol can impair judgement to make driving unsafe. In 2016, there were 10,497 fatalities in motor vehicle traffic crashes involving drunk drivers. Among the 10,497 alcohol-impaired-driving fatalities, 67 percent (7,052) were in crashes in which at least one driver had a BAC of .15, almost twice the legal limit. Be sure to have a game plan for the night so friends and family know who the designated driver is. We want to encourage folks to turn over their keys to a sober driver before they begin drinking, said OCSD Sgt. Brian Sims. Drunk driving can result in serious crashes, injuries or death. If you dont have someone designated to make sure folks get home safely, consider other ride options. There are many other ways to ensure a safe ride home besides relying on a friend. The options include using public transportation, calling a taxi, or using a rideshare program, such as Uber or Lyft. In addition, NHTSAs SaferRide Mobile App, available in the app store, is another resource to help fans who have been drinking find a sober ride home—by identifying their location and calling a taxi or a friend to pick them up. Sober designated drivers should be sure to carry the ball and refrain from drinking alcohol. Be sure your designated driver tweets @NHTSAgov during Super Bowl LII to be featured on NHTSAs National Wall of Fame. This Super Bowl weekend, be a team player and help keep impaired drivers from getting behind the wheel. Dont fumble! Designate your sober driver before the big game begins. And remember: Fans Dont Let Fans Drive Drunk. OCSD Photo",0
"A Mommouth County day trader was arrested after he sold more than 200 grams of cocaine to an undercover Bergen County detective, the Bergen County Prosecutors Office announced. William A. Berry Jr., 46, of Englishtown, was charged with distribution of cocaine, possession of cocaine, and possession of drug paraphernalia, said acting Bergen County Prosecutor Dennis Calo. An investigation by the Bergen County Prosecutors Office Narcotics Task Force revealed that Berry was distributing cocaine in Bergen County, Calo said in a news release. Berry distributed about 20 grams of cocaine to an undercover detective with the Bergen County Prosecutors Office in August, Calo said. Berry also distributed about 200 grams of cocaine to the detective on Sept. 4 and was subsequently arrested, Calo said. Berry was in possession of eight grams of cocaine and drug paraphernalia, including a digital scale and several unused plastic baggies, Calo said. Berry was released on his own recognizance pending a first appearance in Bergen County Central Judicial Processing court on Sept. 19, the acting prosecutor said.

"Hate crimes and incidents on the subway have spiked citywide in the first three months of 2017, while general crime is at an all-time low, city officials said Monday.

Hate crimes are up across the city with 144 incidents through April 2, compared to only 72 for the same period last year. Most of those are anti-Semitic crimes, said Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce, with an uptick in anti-black incidents as well.

Many of the hate crimes are not violent, Boyce said.

Crime in the subways were also up with 37 more transit crimes this year compared to the first three months last year. The NYPD is focusing on repeat offenders, Deputy Commissioner of Operations Dermot Shea said.

“We had a bit of a rocky patch, particularly in Brooklyn and in the Bronx, grand larceny related in transit,” Shea said. “And it’s a perfect example of what one or two recidivists can do in a short period of time.”

Crime overall though has dipped by 5.2 percent so far this year, making it the safest first quarter in modern history and continuing the trend of crime dropping, according to Shea.

There was a 23 percent decrease in shootings this year, compared to 2016 — when the fewest total shooting incidents were recorded, she said. And there were 61 homicides through the first three months of the year, compared to 68 for the same time period last year.

The number of arrests have also dropped by about 10 percent. Shea credited the NYPDs work with the community for the general decline in crime.

“Last year we said that we believed crime could go lower,” Shea said. “We talk about precision policing; it’s become now an efficient precision combined with community engagement.”

In March, there were 18 murders reported, compared to 28 in March 2016; and there were 949 robberies, compared to 1,168 in March of last year.

“This is the safest quarter in the modern era,” said Mayor Bill de Blasio, speaking at the Critical Response Command Headquarters on Randall’s Island. “And that’s an amazing achievement.”",1
"When a 48-year-old man rammed a van into a crowd near a London mosque on Monday morning, controversy quickly erupted over whether the attack would be treated as less significant than others because it was committed against Muslims but not by them.

Such debates have typically played out over whether anti-Muslim violence is labeled terrorism. Though Monday’s attack appears to fit scholarly and legal definitions for terrorism, past incidents have been called hate crimes or attributed to disturbed loners with far-right leanings but no real agenda.

Prime Minister Theresa May called the attack terrorism. But debate has continued, suggesting it is about more than labels, but a suspicion that society grants greater importance to non-Muslim than Muslim victims and to Islamist than far-right or other threats.

Description With Deeper Meaning

These debates have raged since 2015, when the rise of attacks by the Islamic State coincided with an uptick in violence against Muslims in the United States and Europe.",1

Original story: The names of two men who died Wednesday after a three-vehicle wreck on US 378 in Lexington County have been released. Lexington County Coroner Harry O. Harman identified the two victims involved in the collision at US 378 and Shore Road near Gilbert as Edward William Hartung, Jr., 62, of Leesville, and Mieczyslaw Michae Butzich, 87, of Gilbert. The collision happened shortly after 2 p.m. Wednesday when the driver, now identified as Butzich, drove his Ford Focus through a stop sign located on Shore Road at US 378 and hit a Cheverolet pickup, according to the South Carolina Highway Patrol.

"What a colossal waste of college tuition — getting yourself expelled because you dont like who you are rooming with.

As the story was breaking , we told you all about the things that this young Connecticut woman was accused of and why .

Now, according to courant.com, the former University of Hartford student accused of allegedly smearing bodily fluids on her roommates property has asked to have her arraignment to rescheduled. It is now set for Tuesday, November 21.

As a result of the accusations, 18-year-old Brianna Brochu from Harwinton Connecticut has been charged by West Hartford police with breach of peace and criminal mischief. Brochu has also been expelled from the University of Hartford.

It comes as no surprise that college roommates, especially being thrown together for the first time they are living away from home, often dont get along. Changing rooms would be the common response to a bad situation. While that isnt always possible once the semester is underway, it is what generally occurs. The second young woman in this story, Chennel Rowe, was in the process of doing just that when Brianna Brochu decided to use social media to brag about the heinous things she had done to force Rowe to move.

One tremendously stupid move on top of a series of uncalled for actions is what is bringing her to court this week.

"Editorial note: On Thursday night, the David Horowitz Freedom Center put up posters all over the campus of UC Berkeley in conjunction with Milo Yiannopoulos’s “Free Speech Week.” The posters are part of the Freedom Centers campaign to expose Students for Justice in Palestine as a Terrorist Front. The next morning, as soon as they were discovered, Berkeley’s new chancellor, Carol Christ, ordered her minions to tear down the posters, lest they be seen and read by Berkeley students. Chancellor Christ accompanied this assault on free speech with an announcement that her staff was investigating to see whether the posters constituted a “hate crime.”

The posters identify two Berkeley professors Hatem Bazian, a Hamas agent, and Judith Butler, along with several student activists as supporters of terrorists - specifically of the terrorist organization Hamas. This is a factual statement easily checked on the Internet at CanaryMission.org. In its official charter, Hamas calls for the destruction of the Jewish state and the extermination of the Jews. Professor Bazian is chairman of the board of a Hamas funding organization American Muslims for Palestine, that underwrites the boycott Israel (BDS) campaign and the Hamas propaganda activities of Students for Justice in Palestine. Professor Judith Butler, pictured in one of the posters, supports Hamas and the terrorist organization Hezbollah as progressive organizations: Understanding Hamas, Hezbollah as social movements that are progressive, that are on the Left, that are part of a global Left, is extremely important.”

"For the second time in less than two weeks, an Indian-born man in the U.S. has been shot by an attacker who, before firing, allegedly shouted, Go back to your own country. Deep Rai, a Sikh man, was wounded in his Seattle area driveway on Friday night.

Authorities have not yet found the unknown assailant, who has been identified by Rai as a stocky white man about 6 feet tall.

I am sorry to know about the attack on Deep Rai a US national of Indian origin. I have spoken to Sardar Harpal Singh father of the victim, Indias external affairs minister, Sushma Swaraj, said in two tweets Sunday. He told me that his son had a bullet injury on his arm. He is out of danger and is recovering in a private hospital.

The Seattle Times reports that Rai, a U.S. citizen from India, told police a masked man accosted him in the driveway to his home on Friday night. A scuffle broke out between the two men, at which point the assailant broke out his weapon and shot Rai in the arm.

Police are investigating the shooting in Kent as a possible hate crime, according to CNN.

We are treating this as a very serious incident, Ken Thomas, police chief in the Seattle suburb of Kent, told reporters Saturday.

We need our national leaders to make hate crime prevention a top priority, Rajdeep Singh, interim program manager at the New York-based Sikh Coalition, said in a statement, according to the Times. Tone matters in our political discourse, because this a matter of life or death for millions of Americans who are worried about losing loved ones to hate.

As NPRs Julie McCarthy reports for our Newscast unit, this is the second time in as many weeks that an Indian politician has wished a full recovery for a shooting victim in the U.S.

This latest incident follows the targeted shooting in Kansas that killed one Indian national and injured another. The FBI is investigating it as a hate crime, Julie notes. Shaken by the violence, many Indians here say they are thinking twice before traveling to the U.S.

"Sean Christopher Urbanski was charged on Tuesday with committing a hate crime in the May 20 killing of Richard W. Collins III at the University of Maryland at College Park, The Washington Post reported. Mr. Urbanski, who is white, had been arrested in the stabbing of Mr. Collins, a black student at Bowie State University.

The FBI and other authorities are investigating whether Mr. Urbanski’s attack was racially charged. He was a member of the Facebook group “Alt-Reich: Nation.” Mr. Urbanski, who was a student at Maryland, has also been charged with first- and second-degree murder and first-degree assault.

Mr. Collins, who was waiting for an Uber ride with friends, was approached by Mr. Urbanski, who said, “Step left if you know what’s best for you,” according to the police. When Mr. Collins refused, the police say, Mr. Urbanski stabbed Mr. Collins and fled the scene.

"A Florida man was convicted of first-degree murder Tuesday for his role in the slaying of a Guatemalan man who was beaten to death outside his home in 2015.

David Harris, 22, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole immediately after his conviction for the killing of 18-year-old Onésimo Marcelino López-Ramos, the Sun-Sentinel reports.

According to the report, prosecutors had accused Harris of carrying out the attack with two other men during a night of “Guat hunting,” a racial slur referring to their plan to rob people of Guatemalan heritage.

Prosecutors said the victim died in front of his home after an ax-wielding Harris cracked his skull open, citing evidence from the county medical examiner.

“David Harris destroyed and decimated his skull with an ax,” Assistant State Attorney Jill Richstone said. “He’s the one who sent [López-Ramos] straight to his death.”

Harris blamed the death and the hate-crime on co-defendant Austin Taggart. Taggart and Harris’s younger brother, Jesse, are scheduled to have separate trials later this year.

David Harris’s defense attorney, Franklin Prince, argued that the murder weapon was actually a rock used by Taggart and that Harris only hit the victim once with a nonfatal blow from the ax handle.

Harris has also been found guilty of aggravated battery due to evidence of prejudice against the victim’s older brother, Elmer López-Ramos. He received an additional 15-year sentence for that charge.",1
"Almost four in ten British Jews say they hide their faith for fear of anti-Semitic attacks, and one in three have thought about leaving the country because they don’t feel safe anymore, a poll conducted by YouGov found.

Campaign Against Anti-Semitism chairman Gideon Falter told Sky News the findings should be a shot across the bows for the authorities.

Weve got a very serious situation where on the one hand, British society is very effectively starting to shun anti-Semitism, but the institutions we rely on to protect our communities are not doing enough,” he said.

Weve been talking about it for years and years. When are they going to wake up?

The YouGov survey, carried out by the CAA, also found that anti-Semitic attitudes in UK society were declining – down from 45 percent in 2015 to 36 percent in 2017.

Some 65 percent of the nearly 4,000 respondents said they believed the government wasn’t doing enough to protect them – just last month police figures showed a 45 percent increase in hate crimes against Jewish people – and the survey found that only 59 percent of Britain’s 270,000 Jewish people feel welcomed in the UK.",1

"In an effort to proactively address crime and also keep residents safe in Delaware County, District Attorney Katayoun M. Copeland has launched a countywide community camera partnership program for homeowners and businesses to register their camera systems. The announcement was made on the 1700 block of Ridegway Road in Haverford Township at the home of the first registrants in the new program. Through the District Attorneys Criminal Investigation Division, the program, known as DA DelCAM will provide a valuable tool in the fight against crime countywide. It will also serve as a proactive measure to ensure the safety of vulnerable residents and locate missing persons such as children and older residents. For law enforcement, video surveillance is one of the best forms of evidence and it is also a helpful tool in locating and protecting some of our most vulnerable residents, such as a child who may have wandered off or run away from home, someone suffering from drug addiction or mental illness, or an older resident who may be suffering from dementia who strays from their residence, Copeland said. Through this program, law enforcement will have the capability to know where cameras are located throughout the county and access footage quickly and solve crimes faster while also empowering the public to help law enforcement fight crime in their own community. Those who register their camera systems will get a letter from the District Attorney and DA DelCAM emblem to post to show they are participants. Sharing video surveillance systems with law enforcement is a great example of community-law enforcement partnerships and we believe this is a step forward as we investigate crimes in our community and work towards reducing gun violence, Copeland said. Delaware County residents and businesses are encouraged to register their surveillance cameras online through the District Attorneys secure website online here. Participation in the program is strictly voluntary and all information will be kept in a secure database which will only be accessed by verified members of law enforcement. Information provided to the Delaware County District Attorneys Office regarding camera systems will be used for official purposes only and cameras will only be accessed in person with the express consent of the owners. Information from registrants will be stored in a secure database where law enforcement can obtain information regarding video surveillance cameras throughout the county. Through the use of the portal, law enforcement will be able to identify the location of video surveillance cameras that may have recorded the crime and also events relevant to the investigation. As investigations progress, law enforcement would contact the cameras owner and request permission to access images to aid in the investigation. Residents are reminded that if they have witnessed a crime or believe a crime is in progress, they should always immediately contact local authorities by calling 911. For more information, and to securely electronically register a camera system, residents can visit the District Attorneys website online here. Image via Delaware County",0

"CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — FBI statistics show there were 40 hate crimes reported in New Hampshire last year, the highest number of bias-related incidents since 2010.

New Hampshire Public Radio reports the annual hate crimes statistics figures released by the FBI on Monday finds that 15 of the hate crimes reported in the state last year were associated with race or ethnicity. Six were related to religion; five were associated with sexual orientation.

Nationally, there were more than 6,100 hate crimes last year, up about 5 percent over the previous year. In 2015 and 2016, that number was driven by crimes against people because of their race or ethnicity. The FBI says there were increases in attacks motivated by bias against blacks, Jews, Muslims and LGBT people.

Day of Remembrance publicly mourns and honors the lives of our brothers and sisters who might otherwise be forgotten. Through the vigil, we express love and respect for our people in the face of national indifference and hatred.

"Pointing to a rising level of hate crimes and concerns about under-reporting, the Board of Supervisors voted this week to develop an educational campaign against racism and discrimination and to review related sheriff’s department policies.

Supervisor Hilda Solis recommended that the Office of Inspector General lead a group to evaluate whether LASD policies follow best practices on reporting and investigating hate crimes.

“With hate crimes against Latinos, LGBT, African-Americans and other minority groups on the rise, it’s more important than ever for L.A. County to do everything in our power to combat the tide of hate, bigotry and prejudice,” Solis said. “We are proud that L.A. County is one of the most culturally diverse places on earth ... We will never remain silent or passive when confronted by hate, discrimination, bullying, or harassment.”

Hate crimes statewide increased by more than 17 percent from 2016 to 2017, from 982 to 1,013, according to the California Department of Justice.

A separate May report by the state auditor showed that law enforcement authorities under-report hate crimes due to a lack of training and appropriate policies. The Los Angeles Police Department was a part of that audit, while the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department was not included.

Supervisor Sheila Kuehl, who co-authored the motion, said a higher level of such crimes make it even more important for law enforcement agencies to work hard to identify and respond.

“At this historical moment, we have to do everything we can to counter and stand up against intolerance and hate,” Kuehl said.

Sheriff Jim McDonnell, who chairs the Anti-Defamation League’s Law Enforcement Advisory Committee, backed the motion, although he said reports of hate crimes in areas policed by the sheriff’s department are down 31 percent from 2017 levels as of June.

“I strongly support any effort to create awareness about how to report hate crimes,” McDonnell said. “Our commitment at the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department is absolute in our support of the ADL’s mission to combat bigotry, bias and hate.”

The board asked the county chief executive officer to report back on funding for a multi-year public outreach campaign to begin sometime in the next 12 months.

A report is expected back in 90 days.",1
"COMMACK, NY - A Florida man was arrested for sexually abusing children while employed as their babysitter in Suffolk County, the Suffolk DAs office said Friday. Benjamin Fielman, 27, sexually abused and took sexually explicit photos and videos of three children between 7 and 11 years old who were in his care between 2009 and 2014 while he was living in Commack, DA Tim Sini said. He pleaded not guilty to 27 charges including: first and second degree course of sexual conduct against a child, use of a child in a sexual performance as a sexually motivated felony, promoting a sexual performance by a child, and endangering the welfare of a child, according to court records. He was extradited from Florida where he was convicted to 10 years in prison for other sexual crimes which he plead guilty to, the DA said. While living in Commack, he worked as a private babysitter as well as an assistant teacher at the Suffolk Y Jewish Center in Commack between 2008 and 2011. Fielman was held without bail. If convicted, he faces 40 years in prison. We have serious concerns there are more victims, Sini said during the conference. Its very important that any victim out there know that we care, that we want them to come forward that well take steps to make this process as appropriate as possible, protect their identity and provide them victim services. Anyone with any additional information on Fielman is encouraged to call police at 631-852-6279.

"Tuesday’s shooting in Fresno, California, that left three white men dead at the hands of a black man who called himself “Black Jesus” and wrote of “white devils” highlighted a growing and disturbing trend—hate crimes that lead to multiple fatalities.

Related: In Fresno Shooting, Suspect Kori Ali Muhammad Shouted ‘Allahu Akbar,’ Wrote About Hatred of White People

Kori Ali Muhammad shouted “Allahu Akbar” as he was taken into custody after allegedly gunning down the three men, adding to the white security guard that police say he had killed days earlier. But the incident was not, police later said, an act of terrorism.

“We do not believe ... that this is a terrorist-related crime,” Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer told reporters. “This is solely based on race. He added: “We believe it is a hate crime, definitely a hate crime.”

If it is indeed a hate crime, it would continue the upward trend of hate crimes in the United States over the past two years. Overall, the number of hate crimes, defined by the FBI as a “criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity,” rose six percent in 2015.

And there is set to be a further increase recorded for 2016, according to preliminary data collected by the nonpartisan Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, and provided to Newsweek Wednesday. That would be the first back-to-back increase since 2004. In California, the same trend is expected to be found, which would be the first time in the state in 20 years.

While there has been much focus on hate crimes, particularly following a spike in the wake of last November’s election, as a total figure, the number is still considerably lower than the levels reported in 2001.

However, multi-fatality homicides carried out by a lone gunman are on the rise. The number of murders resulting from hate crimes reached 18 in 2015, a small fraction of the 5,850 recorded incidents, but the largest number since 1996. Although official data has not been released, that figure will rise substantially in 2016. Last June, the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history took place, when 49 people were killed at a gay nightclub in Orlando.

Brian Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism and a criminal justice professor at California State University, San Bernardino, told Newsweek that “there are segments of the hate crime picture that appear to be getting more violent.

What we’re seeing is an increase in the very small number of hate homicides relative to how many hate crimes there are,” he said. “But within that small crucible of homicides, the multi-fatality extremist is becoming a significant player in the world of hate homicides, more so than they ever have.”

Levin has warned that the country could be “on the cusp of an eruption” in social tensions. And, at a time that President Donald Trump’s administration is reportedly set to focus counter-extremism efforts solely on Islamist extremism, Levin said that the threat is as diverse as it has been in some time.

There is something of a perfect storm fueling such extremism. Americans’ views of race relations in the country are at one of the lowest levels seen since the aftermath of the Los Angeles riots in 1992. Meanwhile, trust in government is at one of its lowest ebbs in more than 40 years, with a president setting record-low approval ratings and attracting regular protests across the country.

“Across the spectrum, people feel disenfranchised and not served by the institutions that used to bind us together,” Levin said. “The civic cohesion is eroding.”

An example of such tension occurred just this past weekend when clashes between Trump supporters and anti-fascist activists Antifa turned violent in Berkley, California. Social media, says Levin, has made it far easier for extremists, from Antifa on the left to the so-called alt-right, to organize into violent clashes.

But the internet also has made it a great deal simpler for unstable individuals to become radicalized to commit the sort of deadly, violent acts witnessed in Fresno.

In recent years, there have been several mass homicides by lone extremists. Last year, there was a murder of five police officers in Dallas by a gunman who sought to kill as many white people as possible. The previous year saw nine people gunned down at a black church and 14 killed by Islamic extremists in San Bernardino. Other such multiple-fatality homicides occurred in 2012 at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin and in 2009 at Fort Hood military base.

“Social networking is providing a tool for independent, angry, unstable loners to sculpt their own violent anger from reservoirs available on the internet without even having to join a group,” Levin said. “It’s this kind of virtual organizing that’s radicalizing killers of all types.",1

"Police said the attack on a young Muslim girl was not a hate crime. News4s Jackie Bensen reports.

What to Know Nabra Hassanen, a high school sophomore in Northern Virginia, died after a man attacked her with a bat near her mosque.

Fairfax County police believe the murder suspect attacked the teen girl in a road rage incident, not because of anti-Muslim hate.

The suspect is an El Salvador native living in the U.S. illegally, ICE says.

Police believe the teenage girl who died after a man hit her with a baseball bat as she headed to a mosque in Fairfax County, Virginia, on Sunday was a victim of road rage, not a hate crime.

Nabra Hassanen died after Darwin Martinez Torres, 22, beat her and then dumped the 17-year-old girls body in a pond, police said. He has been charged with murder.

Hassanen and a group of more than a dozen youths had just finished eating at a McDonalds and were heading back to the All Dulles Area Muslim Society (ADAMS) Center in Sterling for an all-night Ramadan event when they noticed a man in a car following them, the teens told News4.

The driver jumped a curb, got out of the car with a bat and began chasing the teens. He was able to catch Hassanen. He beat her and then took her to a pond nearby in Loudoun County.

Teens Speak About 17-Year-Old Girl Killed Near Mosque

Friends of Nabra Hassanen speak about the moments before a man drove onto the sidewalk, enraged. News4s Julie Carey reports. (Published Monday, June 19, 2017)

After an hourslong search, police found her body in a pond.

This tragic case appears to be the result of a road rage incident involving the suspect, who was driving and who is now charged with murder, and a group of teenagers who was walking and riding bikes in and along a roadway, police said in a statement Monday afternoon.

Our investigation at this point in no way indicates the victim was targeted because of her race or religion, the statement continues.

If evidence surfaces that indicates hate did play a role, additional charges could be filed.

Hassanen died of blunt force trauma to the head and neck, a medical examiner determined.

Hassanens father, Mahmoud Hassanen, wept as he spoke about what he would say to Torres.

Virginia Teen Murdered After Leaving Mosque; Man Arrested

A Virginia teen girl was assaulted and murdered early Sunday morning, police say. News4s Darcy Spencer reports she was coming back to a mosque with her friends when they came across a driver who got into a confrontation with them. (Published Sunday, June 18, 2017)

Why you kill my daughter? For what? She didnt do anything to anybody. I raised my kids to love everybody, he said.

A steady stream of mourners visited the familys home on Monday.

Hassanen was the oldest of four siblings and was about to finish her sophomore year at South Lakes High School. On Monday, classmates decorated her locker.

Torres of Sterling was charged with murder, and a judge ordered at a court appearance Monday that he be held without bond.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) filed a detainer against Torres on Monday, meaning he was living in the U.S. illegally. He is originally from El Salvador and had no prior encounters with ICE, a spokeswoman said.

Police say Torres and a boy on a bike argued on Dranesville Road, which has bike lanes. Then, the driver jumped the sidewalk, forcing teens to run into the woods to hide.

Police Believe Missing Teen Found Dead in Fairfax County

Police believe they have found the remains of a missing 17-year-old girl that was reported missing early Sunday morning in Fairfax County, Virginia. News4s Darcy Spencer reports a man has been taken into custody in connection to her death. (Published Sunday, June 18, 2017)

It appears the suspect became so enraged over the traffic dispute it escalated into deadly violence, a Fairfax County police spokeswoman said.

The assaults stretched over Fairfax and Loudoun counties, police said.

Officers started searching for Hassanen about 4 a.m. Sunday in the area of Dranesville Road and Woodson Drive in Herndon, Fairfax County Officer Tawny Wright said at a news conference Sunday evening.

Police searched a wooded area near Dranesville Road and Woodson Drive area in Herndon for several hours. Loudoun County authorities also helped in the investigation, because the area borders the county.

During the search, an officer saw a car driving suspiciously in the area, pulled the driver over and then took him into custody.

Police found Hassanens body Sunday afternoon in a pond in Loudoun County about 3 p.m.

Police said the baseball bat was recovered.

The case could be prosecuted in Loudoun County, a Fairfax County police spokeswoman said.

Torres is due in court July 19.

In the meantime, Hassanens family, friends and community are mourning the shock of her brutal death.

Shes one of a kind. No one will ever take her place, one young friend said.

A vigil will be held at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday at Lake Anne Plaza.

"CINNAMINSON, NJ — Fallen New Jersey State Trooper and Cinnaminson man Sean Cullens name will be unveiled as part of the large granite monument that bears the names of all officers from Burlington County law enforcement agencies who have died in the line of duty as part of the Burlington County Chiefs of Police Associations Fallen Officers Memorial Service next week. The service is set for Wednesday, May 17, 10:30 a.m. at the Burlington County Public Safety Center, located at 1 Academy Drive in Westampton. The event honors Burlington County law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty. It brings together the entire law enforcement community and the public for a period of solemn remembrance. All members of the law enforcement community, the public and the media are invited and encouraged to attend. Cullen was killed in an accident on 295 in West Deptford last year. He was struck by a passing driver while responding to the scene of an accident and active fire. Cullen was an all-American wrestler who graduated from Cinnaminson High School. He was born in Dublin, Ireland, emigrated to the United States with his family when he was a child, and graduated from Cinnaminson High School in 2003. Additionally, blue ribbons are available to members of the public as part of a nationwide effort to honor law enforcement officers and pay respect to those who have lost their lives in the line of duty. The Blue Ribbon Campaign is held in conjunction with National Police Week. The Prosecutors Office and the Burlington County Chiefs of Police Association, of which Medford Township Police Chief Richard J. Meder is president, are spearheading the Blue Ribbon effort in Burlington County. It is imperative that we strongly and outwardly show our support for the police officers who have dedicated their professional careers, and their lives, to protecting the public and keeping us all safe from harm, Coffina said. These ribbons also signify our remembrance, and continued gratitude and respect, for those officers who made the ultimate sacrifice while working for the betterment of our communities. Last year in the United States, approximately 145 officers lost their lives in the line of duty. The Blue Ribbon Campaign is funded each year by Concerns of Police Survivors, Inc. (C.O.P.S.), which distributes more than 600,000 ribbons annually across the nation. The ribbons have been made available to Burlington County municipal police departments for distribution to the public. Members of the public who wish to show their support should contact their local police department to receive a ribbon. The ribbons are also available at the BCPO and the Burlington County Sheriffs Department in Mount Holly. National Police Week annually falls during the calendar week that includes May 15, because that was the date designated in 1962 by President John F. Kennedy as Peace Officers Memorial Day. Several ceremonies are held annually during this time in Washington, D.C. For more information, visit www.nationalcops.org. Patch file photo",0
"Sessions generally hasn’t been a friend to the transgender community.

As senator, Jeff Sessions was considered one of the LGBT community’s biggest foes, having voted in favor of a federal ban on same-sex marriage, against the repeal of “don’t ask, don’t tell,” and against adding protections for sexual orientation and gender identity to federal hate crime laws. As attorney general, he’s made similar moves, pushing to revoke rules protecting transgender students, and ordering the Justice Department to take the position in court cases that transgender people are not protected from workplace discrimination under federal civil rights laws.

However, Sessions is making good on a promise to vigorously prosecute crimes committed against individual transgender people.

A top Justice Department civil rights attorney, Christopher J. Perras, has been dispatched to Iowa to help prosecute a man charged with killing a gender-fluid teen in Burlington last year.

Jorge “Lumni” Sanders-Galvez has been charged with first-degree murder in the March 2016 shooting of 16-year-old Kedarie Johnson. If convicted, Sanders-Galvez could face the death penalty.

The victim’s mother told the Des Moines Register that he did not identify as transgender and always used the pronoun “he,” but he liked to wear women’s clothes and sometimes went by the name Kandicee.

According to the New York Times, sending Perras to work on the case is a “highly unusual move” that was “personally initiated” by Sessions.

It was sparked by a letter six House members sent Sessions last spring asking him to investigate several killings of transgender black women across the country. Sessions ordered the department’s top civil-rights lawyers to review the cases, and at a Justice Department summit in June he vowed to take action — though when he was in the Senate he voted against making it a federal crime to attack someone for their gender identity.

“We have and will continue to enforce hate crime laws aggressively and appropriately where transgendered [sic] individuals are victims,” Sessions said.

A Justice Department spokesman described the move as just another example of Sessions’s “commitment to enforcing the laws enacted by Congress and to protecting the civil rights of all individuals.”

Vanita Gupta, the former head of the DOJ’s civil-rights division under President Obama, didn’t give Sessions much credit for the move. “While it is of course good that D.O.J. is aggressively pursuing this case, it would behoove Sessions to connect the dots between his policies that promote discrimination and hate that can result in death,” she told the Times.",1
"A Peabody man known under several different names pleaded guilt to heroin and fentanyl trafficking charges in U.S. District Court on Wednesday. Jorge Delgado, a/k/a Antonio Martinez, a/k/a Elisaul Martinez Santana, 28, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute heroin and fentanyl and three counts of distribution of heroin. U.S. District Court Judge F. Dennis Saylor IV scheduled sentencing for Jan. 13, 2016. Delgado was the leader of a drug ring responsible for distributing heroin and fentanyl in the Salem and Peabody area, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office. They say Delgado received orders for heroin from customers via cellphone and often sent couriers, two of whom were charged as co-defendants, to distribute drugs for him. Delgados drug ring not only distributed heroin but also distributed fentanyl in place of heroin on numerous occasions. Delgados co-defendants, Juanel Pena and Thomas Martinez-Ortiz, previously pleaded guilty. This case was brought as part of the federal response to the growing opioid abuse epidemic in Massachusetts and other New England states. A recent surge in overdose deaths has been attributed in part to the addition of Fentanyl to heroin, creating a toxic mixture substantially more potent, and more dangerous, than heroin alone, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office. The charging statute provides a sentence of no greater than 20 years in prison, a minimum of three years and up to a lifetime of supervised release and a fine of $1 million. Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. United States Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz; Michael J. Ferguson, Special Agent in Charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Boston Field Division; Chief Mary Butler of the Salem Police Department; and Chief Thomas M. Griffin of the Peabody Police Department, made the announcement today. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Young Paik.",0

"Despite area interest in increasing public safety, housing the Cook County Sheriffs Central Warrants Unit at the former 13th District Police Station will not affect area police patrolling. Ald. Proco Joe Moreno (1st) announced Wednesday the County Board of Commissioners passed the proposal for the station at 927 N. Wood St. The space has remained vacant since December when it was consolidated with the 12th Districts station. But while Moreno said hes kept his promise to keep a police presence at the station, some neighbors note the Central Warrants Unit is not similar to actual law enforcement, but instead deals with the apprehension of county fugitives. When the announcement that the 13th district police station would be closed and consolidated with the 12th District Station, I vowed to fight for a police presence on the site, Moreno said in a statement. Today, I am extremely happy and proud to have kept this promise. When the announcement was made regarding the stations closure, a five-person team was created to help decide what should be done with the old building. Ideas like a dog park or community amphitheater were included in a survey sent to residents, but based on comments, neighbors wished they could keep police at the station. With topline from early October, three things popped, but importantly, nearly 50 percent of the respondents added comments requesting some form of POLICE presence, comments Ronda Locke, a member of the five-person panel. The three things that popped were in order 1) land swap in order to expand Commercial Park, 2) adult park at Wood St, or 3) dog park, with comments to the affect if a police presence was not an option. Although the Central Warrants Unit is not the same as Chicago police officers, Moreno said the five-person team was overwhelmingly pleased with this news. For the next 10 years, at least 100 sheriffs will be located at the station, writes Our Urban Times. The plan, which has yet to be approved by the City Council, said the county will pay $1 annually to least the space through 2023. Moreno says $500,000 in city money, as well as $100,000 in Ward 1 menu money, will help fund the new facility, DNAinfo Chicago reports. Follow Us on Facebook!",0

"MCKINNEY, Texas - It was supposed to be a dream family vacation in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. But twin sisters, Barbara Thomas and Beverly Sckripsky, 67, were swept away by a killer wave. Their families are at a loss.

You had two wonderful people just walking on the beach and full of life a couple hours before that, and theyre now gone, said Steve Thomas, Barbaras husband.

The two lived in McKinney. They started dating in middle school and had been married for 45 years. Thomas remembers his wife as a kind, magnetic woman who loved helping others.

Anybody that knew her, loved her, said Thomas.

October 22 was the third day of what should have been a week-long vacation. Thomas remembers the last time he saw his wife alive.

My last memory was, Come with us and go on the walk, said Thomas. And I didnt go. I literally watched her walk out the door and she wanted me to go with her.

Barbara and Beverly were walking on the beach when a large, powerful wave pulled them into the ocean, and they drowned. When they didnt return, Thomas and his family alerted authorities and went looking for them.

We found one of their sandals and when we found the sandal it was like. My head told me they were gone, but my heart hoped against hope, said Thomas.

The so-called rogue waves have killed multiple tourists in that area, prompting the U.S. Embassy in Mexico to issue a warning about potentially deadly conditions on beaches in areas that arent always clearly marked.

Beaches on both the Pacific and Sea of Cortes sides of the Baja California peninsula, near Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo, can be dangerous due to strong currents, riptides and rogue waves, said the warning, in part. Swimmers, waders and even people simply walking along the beaches have been washed into the ocean by rogue waves. Some have drowned and others have disappeared. Surfers and other water sports enthusiasts should always inquire about local conditions before going into the water.

Thomas experienced it, first hand.

[The wave] went up five feet every second, from five feet to 20 feet, and I was literally just looking at a wall of water, said Thomas.

The twins were best of friends who loved traveling together and planning family trips. At 67 years old, they were full of love and life.

Now Thomas hopes their story will help save someone else.

There are certain beaches there that are killer beaches, said Thomas. If youre out on the beach or in the ocean, you need to be very, very cautious of whats going on around you.

Friends and family will hold a joint Celebration of Life service November 18 at Christ United Methodist Church in Plano.

A young Jew was severely assaulted on Tuesday by a number of Arabs near the Givat Asaf junction in Binyamin, Honenu reported Thursday. The young man was severely wounded in the attack, his skull was cracked, his ribs were broken, and he suffered a hole in his lungs. He is hospitalized at Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem.

On Wednesday, the young man approached the Honenu legal aid society for help as a crime victim. Honenu attorney Haim Bleicher arrived at the hospital and took down the injured man’s testimony. An inquiry with the police revealed that they had arrested one of the attackers immediately following the incident, but released him shortly thereafter.

Bleicher sent an urgent letter to the commander of the Judea and Samaria police precinct, detailing the incident: “While my client was standing on the hill, a shepherd in his 40s, accompanied by a child, approached him. When my client asked from afar what they were doing, the shepherd began to throw stones at my client while using his mobile phone to call on other rioters to come over.

“My client tried, but was unable to call for help.

“A vehicle arrived soon after with two minority young who began throwing stones at my client and advanced toward him with clubs. My client tried to retreat while facing his assailants, to avoid the stones they were throwing at him, while he heard the older assailant yelling at the boys to ‘slaughter’ my client,” Bleicher described the incident, adding that his client managed to finally escape the beatings and stones by rolling to the highway and yelling for help. He stated that to the best of his knowledge police picked up the suspect right away and then let them go.

Finally, Bleicher demanded that the police arrest the assailants immediately: “This is a serious incident with severe consequences, which took place strictly because my client is an Israeli Jew. I would like you to immediately arrest the assailants and exhaust the investigation of the incident.”

Noting that “the police are yet to have taken down my client’s complaint about the attack,” attorney Bleicher insisted that “an investigator arrive at the hospital as soon as possible in order to record my client’s complaint.”

Stressing that the attack on his client “could have easily ended in murder,” attorney Bleicher said “the attackers are dangerous terrorists and the law and security authorities must immediately put their hands on them. Unfortunately, the suspects were released at the time of the incident, but now that the details of the incident have been clarified, they must be arrested without delay.”

“We intend to continue to follow up until the full prosecution of these terrorists is completed,” Bleicher said.",1

Lecia Brooks addresses UMass Amherst about the current state of hate and extremist groups in the United States.

AMHERST — The Southern Poverty Law Center addressed the University of Massachusetts Amherst on Monday about the current state of hate and extremism in the United States.

Lecia Books, an outreach director at SPLC, delivered a comprehensive presentation in Goodell Hall where discussed the relationship between race demographics and the upswing in hate crimes.

Projections say that by 2040, white will no longer be the majority race in the United States. Brooks says that this shift has caused a rise in hate crimes and given power to people like President Donald Trump and Steve Bannon.

“There was a tremendous spike in hate-based related incidents right after the election,” Brooks said.

In response, the SPLC seeks to inform the public with a comprehensive list of hate groups and individual extremists.

“People are feeling emboldened to share any biased or bigoted thought they had,” Brooks said.

She encouraged the UMass community to pay attention in particular to hate speech that “doesn’t rise to the level of crime.” In other words, verbal and written acts of hate that can’t be stopped by current U.S. legislation.

“Most troubling to me [is] this return of the swastika everywhere,” said Brooks. She said that the U.S. must “not allow the display of the swastika to become a normal thing that we don’t even think about.”

In addition to acts of hatred and anti-Semitism, Brooks said a huge catalyst of hate crimes and hate speech has been anti-immigrant sentiment. President Trump’s presidential campaign was focused largely on the deportation of undocumented immigrants, and the SPLC notes a rise in resulting hate speech and crimes.

“Deporting close to a million people is what extremists do, it’s not what principled people do,” said Brooks. “I think it’s important for you to at least think about the principal position that you’re taking or not taking.”

Brooks condoned the new UMass initiative, called “Hate Has No Home at UMass.” She encouraged the UMass community to ask themselves, “What is going to be said about you and what you did to forward the social justice movement?”

She specifically encouraged white students to have conversations with each other about racism, hate speech and white supremacy.

“White students, especially first and second year college students, are vulnerable to white supremacist messages,” said Brooks. White students, she said, should talk to each other about what it means to be white, and to family and friends about racism they may be perpetuating, whether they’re conscious of it or not.

“One day you might be in the group that has to pay attention, because one day you might be targeted,” said Brooks.

"Story highlights African-American college student was killed because of his race, a prosecutor says

Evidence was pulled from the defendants phone and computer, authorities say

(CNN) A grand jury on Tuesday indicted a white former University of Maryland college student on a hate crime charge in the stabbing death of a black US Army lieutenant, authorities said.

Sean Christopher Urbanski, 22, of Severna Park, is accused of killing Richard Collins III in the predawn hours of May 20 at a campus bus stop. Collins attended nearby Bowie State University.

Urbanski was a member of a Facebook group called Alt-Reich, which spews hatred toward minorities and especially African-Americans, police said at the time

Collins was killed because of his race, Angela D. Alsobrooks, states attorney for Prince Georges County, said declining to release specific details about the evidence that led the grand jury to hand down the indictment on the hate crime resulting in death charge.

There was lots of digital evidence that we could look at to get a sense for the motive in this case, Alsobrooks said.

"DeKalb County police identified today one of two men killed in a double shooting on Buford Highway on Sunday afternoon as 28-year-old Quan Quoc Lai. No additional information about Lai was available Monday afternoon, police spokeswoman Mekka Parish said. Police found two victims along the highway. The first was found in Little Saigon Plaza, 4186 Buford Highway, after police responded to a call of a shooting at 2:46pm. Minutes later, police found the second victim in the parking lot at 5150 Buford Highway. Both victims were involved in an altercation in Little Saigon Plaza when gunfire erupted, Parish said. There were several witnesses standing nearby. The first victim died shortly after the shooting, and the second died hours later after he was taken to Atlanta Medical Center. Police are still trying to determine what caused the shooting and which role each victim played. Parish said she did not know which one was Lai.",0
"- Alameda Police say they are investigating a noose found at Alameda High as a hate crime. The four-foot long noose was found by a teacher near the tennis courts at the corner of Oak Street and Encinal Avenue on Tuesday afternoon.

Our school resource officer responded there immediately and found what appeared to be a noose hanging from the fence onto the sidewalk. It was laying on the sidewalk, said Alameda Police Lt. Hosh Durani.

Police dont have any suspects, but they do know where the rope came from.

The rope that was used was taken from the fence at the school, has privacy curtains, Durani said. Normally that privacy curtain is held up by the rope that goes through the eyelets and hangs.

The school district says parents were notified through robocalls within an hour of the incident.

We are a district that firmly believes everyone belongs here, said Susan Davis, Alameda Unified School District spokeswoman. We denounce any kind of hatred or bigotry and we know our high school stands behind us on that.

This is a serious thing, said Courtney Smith, whose son is a senior at the school. This is an ancestral thing.

At Alameda High, the percentage of African American students is a little over five percent.

The story of the noose was hurtful, you know it was hurtful, Smith said. We see the climate thats happening around the country so we understand, so when I saw it, when I heard it, it was hurtful. And then you go into protection mode in terms of your son and you care about their safety.

Many students we talked to hadnt heard about incident.

Im concerned about it, just based on the fact of the amount of white kids thats here and there a very, very small amount of African Americans, said student Zaire Campbell.

Another student, Kennedy Miller said, its kind of, I want to say, disgusting to go to this school with such diversity and just for someone to put that up there.

Besides the noose found on campus, Alameda Police are still investigating other incidents including vandalism at a synagogue, fliers with swastikas left on a street. Anyone with information in any of these cases is asked to call Alameda Police.",1

"HOLLYWOOD, CA — Police Thursday said a Hollywood familys pit bull mix shot by an officer who responded to a nearby gang-related shooting continues to be aggressive to the treating veterinarian. The dog was wounded around 2:30 a.m. Saturday when officers responded to a shooting that occurred in an alley near the 5800 block of Willoughby Street and left three men injured, according to Los Angeles police Officer Norma Eisenman. Officers were clearing a residence when a large dog charged at them and an officer-involved shooting occurred, Eisenman said. The pit bull mix, named Kush, will require medical care topping $1,000, which his owners cannot afford, officials with the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Los Angeles said. According to an LAPD statement, the dog charged one of the officers conducting the search and the officer fired a single shot at the animal, which then ran into an adjoining room, only to return moments later and attempt to bite the officer. The dog stopped and ran to the bathroom where it was secured pending the arrival of (Animal Control), police said. The dog was taken to a city shelter to be treated by a veterinarian, who commented that treating (the) dog has been difficult as he is showing signs of aggression to caregivers, according to the LAPD. Brett Kerby and Norma Lopez, who live at the home and own the dog, told KTLA that officers had detained them in a patrol car then went into the house. They said their 7-year-old daughter was in the home along with her grandmother and a family friend. Officers who went into the home refused an offer by the family friend to remove the dog, and they shot Kush a short time later, the couple told the station. They said everyone was then taken out of the home, but the bleeding dog was left inside unattended until an animal-control officer arrived around 7 a.m. and took Kush to a shelter. Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Los Angeles officials contend the LAPD should pay for the dogs care, not force the family to cover the costs and seek reimbursement. I believe this demonstrates seizure of property and the agency (LAPD) should be responsible for treatment, spcaLA President Madeline Bernstein said. Forcing the owner to pay for vet care and submit a claim is unfair, Bernstein said. When an officer shoots a family dog, it is traumatic for everyone -- the officer, the dog, the family, and the community -- lets help them all heal by providing for Kushs care. The family has set up a GoFundMe page at www.gofundme.com/justice-for- kush, saying they will need at least $5,000 to cover the dogs medical care. Our Force Investigation Division detectives are still interviewing witnesses and collecting evidence as this investigation continues, according to the LAPD.

"NASHVILLE, TN — Metro Police arrested four people early Tuesday morning for allegedly trying to rob a gun store. The alarm at Shooters at 573 Murfreesboro Road went off around 5:15 Tuesday morning. When police arrived, they saw no immediate signs of forced entry, such as broken windows, but did notice a car parked beside a nearby abandoned building. Police blocked in the car and arrested an adult male and juvenile female when they returned to the car. Meanwhile, other officers saw that the back door of the gun store had been kicked in and that a pipe had been used to bust through the drywall. While they were investigating, two other men arrived on the scene and asked police what was going on. One of those men had drywall dust on his pants. That pair of men was also arrested.

"In what has turned out to be yet another hate hoax, a black man has taken responsibility for vandalizing his own car with “Go Home N***er Boy” as part of what he calls a “prank.” Despite the fact that the man filed a false police report, police say they will not be pressing charges against him.

On Nov. 1, the Kansas City Star reported a man who identified himself as a student at Kansas State University claimed his car had been vandalized with a slew of racially charged phrases. At first, the name of the alleged student was withheld, as he reportedly “did not want the attention.”

However, he told the Kansas City Star he believed the vandalism against him was “sad, hurtful and disappointing” and said he left the university as a result of the vandalism.

Another week, another incident involving racism at @KState



This is getting to the point where it’s expected. pic.twitter.com/dtKzMT0mwF — Andrew Hammond (@ahammsportsgeek) November 1, 2017

Although Kansas State University claims they never had anyone enrolled at the school by the victim’s name, they still issued a statement decrying the “alleged hate crime.

Police have now identified Dauntarius Williams, the 21-year-old owner of the car, as the person responsible for defacing the vehicle.

In an article on Nov. 6, the Kansas City Star reports two law enforcement agencies came to the conclusion that Williams filed a false police report. Police say since Williams appeared to be “remorseful” over the incident, no charges would be filed against him for the false police report.

The Kansas City Star says the decision not to charge Williams is in the “best interests of the citizens of Manhattan.”

In the public police statement on the issue, Williams said, “I would like to deeply apologize to the community. The whole situation got out of hand when it shouldn’t have even started. It was just a Halloween prank that got out of hand. I wish I could go back to that night but I can’t. I just want to apologize from the bottom of my heart for the pain and news I have brought you all.”

Riley County police director Brad Schoen explained, “While Williams’ mistake had a decidedly negative impact on the community, please recognize that he, like many of us when we were young, is a young man who made a mistake and is now doing his best to own up to it.”

A man has been charged with hate crimes for allegedly burglarizing several houses of worship in Flushing, Woodside and Elmhurst due to his hatred of religion and God, the Queens district attorney said.

Churches and temples were targeted.

“The defendant is accused of acting on his hatred of god to brazenly but ecumenically target various houses of worship in Queens County to break into in order to steal cash and other items,” Brown said. “The defendant now faces serious prison time if convicted.”

Joseph Woznik, 23, allegedly committed the burglaries between March 21 and April 10. He is accused of breaking into the Bangladesh Hindu Mandir Temple in Flushing, Blessed Virgin Mary Help of Christians in Woodside, St. Mary’s Roman Orthodox Church in Elmhurst, and St. James Episcopal Church in Flushing, which Brown said had been burglarized three times.

According to Brown, Woznik said in sum and substance at the time of his arrest that he was “mad at God,” that he did not like church or religion and purposefully targeted houses of worship, breaking in “to get back at God.”

Woznik was charged with burglary and grand larceny as hate crimes, as well as forgery and criminal possession of a forged instrument, among other charges, the DA said.

The first burglary took place at the Flushing temple, when an employee arrived March 21 to find that three donation boxes had been forced open. Fingerprints recovered at the scene were later matched to Woznik, according to Brown.

The first St. James burglary was discovered on the morning of March 24, with subsequent burglaries occurring April 3 and April 10. On April 10, a board member at St. Mary’s found that a gold-plated drawer used for communion and the church’s corporate seal embosser were missing.

That same day, an employee at Blessed Virgin Mary Help of Christians found a window had been broken on the church’s office door. She found a donation box opened with pry marks on it and a hammer on the floor next to the open box. Police analyzed security footage which allegedly shows a man they say was Woznik insider the church on the night before, wielding a hammer to use on the donation box.

Woznik is also wanted for burglary by authorities in Orange County, Fla. He faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted of the charges in New York, according to the DA’s office.

"TULSA, Okla. - A 63-year-old Oklahoma man convicted of murder and a hate crime in the fatal shooting of his Lebanese neighbor was sentenced Tuesday morning to life in prison without the possibility of parole. A judge upheld all jury recommendations, plus 11 years and 6 months and $22,000 in fines, CBS affiliate KOTV reports.

Stanley Vernon Majors was convicted earlier this month of gunning down 37-year-old Khalid Jabara outside of his Tulsa home in August 2016. The murder charge carried a life sentence, and the jury recommended that Majors never get the chance to go free - a recommendation the judge followed Tuesday.

According to prosecutors, Majors killed Jabara after bombarding him with racial insults in a feud with Jabaras family that lasted several years. It escalated to the point where the victims mother, Haifa Jabara, obtained a protective order in 2013 that required Majors to stay 300 yards away and prohibited him from possessing any firearms until 2018.

CBS affiliate KOTV

But prosecutors said Majors was undeterred, and that he struck Haifa Jabara with his car in 2015 and drove off. She suffered a broken shoulder, among other injuries. Officers who stopped him later reported that he was intoxicated.

While awaiting trial in that case on assault and battery charges, a judge freed Majors from jail on $60,000 bond, overruling strong objections by prosecutors, who called him a substantial risk to the public and pleaded with the court to set a higher bond of $300,000.

Authorities said Majors shot Khalid Jabara on his own front porch while out on bond.

Defense attorneys argued that Majors showed signs of dementia and appeared to have problems with his long-term memory, and that these conditions interfered with their ability to prepare a defense.

In addition to his convictions in Oklahoma, Majors has a 2009 felony conviction in California for threatening a crime with intent to terrorize.",1

"A 21-year-old college student was at a popular Southern California food festival Sunday night when he allegedly had racist remarks thrown at him and was physically assaulted, he said.

The victim, who is Vietnamese American and wishes to remain anonymous, told NBC News that he was standing in line with his girlfriend at the OC Night Market around 9:30 p.m. when he was approached by two women he described as white. The women asked if he could purchase drinks for them as a way to cut the long line, he said.

A Vietnamese-American college student was allegedly attacked and told to go back to Asia while at a night market in Orange County, California. This photo was provided by the student, who wished to remain anonymous.

When he refused, the women left and came back minutes later, when one allegedly told him to “go back to Asia” where he could “go eat dog,” the victim said. A white man with tattoo sleeves accompanied the women and allegedly punched the victim once in the face before several security guards apprehended the man and women and escorted them off the grounds, according to the victim.

“I was just thinking, all this could’ve been avoided if they just got in line,” he said. “She didn’t have to be racist. But I decided to brush it off and just enjoy the rest of the market.”

The victim and his girlfriend later walked to his car in the parking lot shortly after 11 p.m. when a black four-door sedan pulled up next to them, he said.

A Vietnamese-American college student was admitted to the emergency room after an encounter at the OC Night Market, May 2017. This photo was provided by the student, who wishes to remain anonymous.

According to the victim, the man and one of the women who were removed from the market exited the vehicle and began beating him. The victim’s girlfriend attempted to hold off the woman and was hit in the face while the man hit the victim, bloodying his cheek and damaging his teeth, before the pair returned to their car and drove off, the victim said.

The victim was admitted to an emergency room, where he received an MRI, stitches, and temporary teeth fillings, he said. A crowdfunding page has been created to raise money to help him pay his medical and dental bills.

Orange County Sheriff’s Department Lt. Lane Lagaret told NBC News that the attack is currently being investigated as an assault and battery, and not as a hate crime.

“Based on the statements filed, we’ve determined that, while a racial comment was made, this wasn’t a racially-motivated crime,” Lagaret said.

Anyone who has information about the incident or the suspects is encouraged to contact the OC Sheriff’s Department.

“Our event is a platform that celebrates diversity and all cultures in our community and every event draws a more diverse crowd,” Jonny Hwang, the creator and organizer of the OC Night Market, told NBC News. “As organizers and along with our local vendors and supporters, we won’t let a small group of individuals get in the way of our mission. We are happy the victims are on their way to recovery and hope that law enforcement will be able to sort this out.”

"WATERBURY, CT — Cars stolen from other towns across Fairfield County and beyond have wound up in Waterbury, and Mayor Neil OLeary told WTNH it is an enourmous problem. Deputy Police Chief Fernando Spagnolo said the cars were not stripped for parts, but were often taken on joyrides or to commit other crimes. Cars from Greenwich, Fairfield, Westport, New Canaan, Ridgefield and Middletown have turned up in Waterbury. An Audi S5 stone from Ridgefield was recovered last Monday afternoon after it was reported stolen the night before. In most cases, the victims left their vehicles unlocked with the keys inside, making their vehicle a prime target for theft. Ridgefield Police Capt. Jeff Kreitz told the Ridgefield Press that a gang from Waterbury is suspected to be responsible for the thefts. Ridgefield police investigated 11 reports of stolen vehicles, compared to three reported between 2014 and 2016. Spagnolo told WTNH that young people in gangs are stealing the cars. A 15-year-old girl from Waterbury was shot in the back in Ridgefield after her and a group of teenagers tried to steal a car from a home on Hulda Lane. The girl and another teen were arrested after the girl showed up at Waterbury Hospital with a gunshot wound to her back. Greenwich police Lt. John Slusarz also credited a Waterbury gang among others for swiping luxury cars in Greenwich after eight vehicles were stolen in the town in November alone. Around 35 cars were reported stolen in Fairfield from April 1 to July 27, according to the Connecticut Post. Four cars were stolen in one weekend in November in New Canaan, prompting New Canaan Police Chief Leon Krolikowski to alert his town about the Waterbury gangs alleged involvement. These crimes are being committed by suspected gang members from Waterbury, wrote Krolikowski in a statement, and offered tips to avoid being a victim. Many towns in Fairfield County are experiencing similar crimes from the same gang. Read more from WTNH here. Image via Shutterstock",0

"The suspect in the Minnesota mall stabbing may have been radicalized in the last few months, authorities announced at a Thursday morning news conference. FBI officials and local law enforcement provided a public update on the investigation into the stabbing that left 10 people wounded and the suspect dead at the Crossroads Center mall in St. Cloud. The suspect in the Sept. 17 attack, Dahir Ahmed Adan, 20, became interested in Islam in the last several months, stopped playing Xbox and told his female relatives to be more religious, FBI Special Agent Rick Thornton said at the news conference. We have numerous credible witness accounts of him asking victims during the attack if they were Muslim and at least one instance yelling Allahu akbar while stabbing one of his victims and others heard him yelling Islam Islam during the attack, Thornton added. We were told Adan had not previously shown an interest in religion. Adan also encouraged some female relatives to become more religiously observant. FBI Director James Comey said last week that it appears Adan was motivated by some sort of inspiration from radical Islamic groups. Comey said that investigators are not yet sure which groups may have inspired Adan at this point. On the day after the attack, the Islamic State-linked AMAQ news agency reported that the terrorist group described the suspect as a soldier of ISIS. Stearns County Attorney Janelle Kendall said Thursday that Adan was armed with two steak knives, one of which was bent during the course of the attacks. Kendall also said that off-duty police officer Jason Falconer, who shot and killed Adan following the stabbings, was justified in using lethal force and will not be charged with a crime. Officials showed several surveillance videos of the attack Thursday. One showed Adan stabbing an employee of a mall store, while another showed a bloody Adan crawling and trying to get up after being shot by Falconer.   Kendall said Adan approached Falconer and asked if he was Muslim. Falconer said he was a cop and told Adan to drop the knives he was holding. Adan then charged Falconer, at which point Falconer shot him. Still armed with one knife, Adan got up and crawled toward Falconer. Falconer shot him again. This sequence happened repeatedly until Adan could no longer get up. Kendall said Falconer fired 10 rounds, six of which hit Adan. Adan was wearing a private security uniform at the time of the attack. Kendall said that witnesses heard Falconer state that he is a police officer several times as he held up his police badge. Police were initially dispatched to a report of a stabbing inside the Crossroads Center mall just after 8 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 17. Authorities said Thursday that FBIs Joint Terrorism Task Force is continuing to investigate the attack. Image via YouTube",0
"There were no injuries after a motor vehicle crashed into a bedroom window of an apartment at 59 Frairy St. just before 7 p.m. Saturday, according to Medfield Police. We are just thankful that the guy who lives in there wasnt in bed, said Medfield police officer Larz Anderson, who is investigating the accident. Thankfully theres no injuries. We can fix the building, we can fix the car, you know its hard to put people back together. Anderson said received a call at 6:50 p.m. that a car crashed into the apartment building at 59 Frairy St. The female operator was checked for injuries by Medfield EMTs. She was fine, Anderson said. We brought the EMTs down to evaluate her and make sure she was [OK]. She was kind of freaked out when the ambulance got here. They evaluated her and she was fine. I think she was just kind of shook up from the whole accident. Anderson said the cause of the accident is unknown and will undergo further investigation at the Medfield Police Station. We dont know as far as what happened, Anderson said. [The operator] said she was pulling up to the curb and her boyfriend was next to her [in another vehicle] and said she was going maybe five miles an hour and all of the sudden the car just accelerated. The accident caused fairly extensive damage to the apartment building, according to Anderson. Damage to the brick and the wall on the inside of the apartment was pushed out and the glass obviously was busted up and scattered through [the tenants] apartment, Anderson said. The building manager arrived to the scene and spoke with Medfield Police and the involved parties and Medfields building inspector reviewed the damage before deeming the vehicle OK to be removed, according to Anderson. [He] said it was OK to remove the car and the building wasnt going to fall down, said Anderson. Police will continue to investigate the accident and review the photos. Well go over some of the pictures that we took and see, Anderson said. Its kind of hard to really decipher what exactly happened. Whether its with pictures or sometimes youre at the scene. Well do our best to try and make some sense of it. Anderson said the operator and her boyfriend believe the car malfunctioned and that they would get the vehicle inspected before it is repaired. Shes pretty sure she was standing on the brake … its hard to tell, Anderson said. The floor mat wasnt stuffed under, which does happen on occasion. Everything appeared to be functioning as it was supposed to as [the tow truck operator] pulled it away. It could have been just a glitch in the computer system. A lot of times they dont even have accelerator cables anymore. Years ago they used to stick but now they do everything electronically. It may be just a glitch in the computer system or maybe operator error thinking that youre on the break. Anderson said he told the vehicle operator to follow through the investigation while the car is repaired. Maybe they will be able to find something, Anderson said. I told her to really be involved in it when the vehicle is repaired so she can explain exactly what she thinks happened. Hopefully theyll find something on the electronics end of it. While Medfield Police said the accident was not a result of drug, alcohol or cell phone use, Anderson said the investigation will likely result in the operator being cited. Shell probably end up being cited for failure to use care and caution and failure to stop, said Anderson. If they do find something wrong with the car then she can just appeal it and say this is what happened. The tenant of the apartment unit the vehicle crashed into said he would not be displaced and the building manager had a crew cleaning up the glass and boarding up the broken window.",0

NAPERVILLE, Ill. -- A Jewish deli in Naperville was the target of a hate crime over the weekend.

Yesterday afternoon someone spray-painted “Free Gaza” in front of the Schmalt’s Delicatessen.

The vandals struck sometime between 2:30 p.m. and 4 p.m. Sunday.

After calling police the owner Howard Bender with the help of his daughter posted a statement to Facebook that thousands have seen and many offering their support.

“I thought the community would say, ‘We are behind you,’” Howard said. “But I didn’t think it was going to be the overwhelming response it’s gotten.”

It took two hours but Howard was able to get the scrub the paint off the concrete.

But the shock has not worn off.

"DUGGER, IN — A 12-year-old Shelburn girl who threatened students and staff at Dugger Union Community School has been arrested, authorities said. The girl made multiple threats on the popular social media app Snapchat, the Sullivan County Sheriffs Office said in a Facebook post. Investigators worked through Monday evening and arrested the girl at a residence just after 12:30 a.m. on Tuesday, authorities said. No weapons were found, nor any other items that wouldve made the threat credible, authorities said. Even so, they issued a stern warning to anyone else thinking of making such threats. We are not going to put up with it, Sheriff Clark Cottom said in the post. Threaten our schools and we will track you down and arrest you. The girl has been charged with felony intimidation. She was taken to the sheriffs office and will be taken to the Southwest Juvenile Detention Center in Vincennes, authorities said. The sheriffs office sent staff to help the Dugger town marshal with patrolling the school on Tuesday. The school is located off East Co Road 50 South, near South Co Road 750 East. The case is among roughly a dozen involving school threats in the state since the mass shooting last week at a Parkland, Florida, high school that killed 17 students and faculty.

"A white supremacist who traveled to New York City to kill black men subscribed to numerous neo-Nazi, anti-feminist and far-right conspiracy theory channels on YouTube, according to what appears to be his personal account on the website.

James Harris Jackson stabbed a black man with a sword on the street in Manhattan on Wednesday, March 22, in what he admitted to police was an intentional hate crime. Jackson, who is from Maryland, told police he is a member of a white supremacist hate group.

Jackson had traveled to New York with plans to kill black men in relationships with white women, but wound up targeting a homeless man in an act of terrorism. Jackson says he carried out the attack to send a message and claims hes written a racist manifesto.

On what appears to be Jacksons personal YouTube account, he subscribed to a variety of fascist YouTube channels, many of which support President Donald Trump and other far-right leaders and circulate anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. His subscription list is a whos who of alt-right figures, including Alex Jones, Stefan Molyneux, Paul Ray Ramsey and many more.

Jackson subscribed to the channel for the National Policy Institute and Radix. The former is the white supremacist organization founded by neo-Nazi Richard Spencer (who led a Hail Trump chant at a white supremacist conference last year), and the latter is the fascist journal Spencer publishes. Openly neo-Nazi channels Jackson subscribed to include Cybernazi, Politically Incorrect and Esoteric Truths. He also frequented many racist, anti-Semitic, white nationalist and anti-feminist channels. Jackson did not upload any videos onto his channel, but he did recently favorite racist videos, including two titled, Is It Time For Whites To Start Voicing Their Displeasure With Black On White Crimes? and Blacks Know That Blacks Are Violent So Why Does The White Media Pretend They Are Not?

The channel was uncovered by Internet detective @HenryKrinkIe, a leftist Twitter user who hunts Nazis. KrinkIe previously uncovered the white supremacist website and manifesto left by neo-Nazi Dylann Roof, who massacred nine people at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina in hopes of starting a race war. Roof said in his manifesto that he was radicalized by far-right white supremacist websites.

Krinkle was able to uncover Jacksons YouTube channel through some master sleuth work.

Media reports noted that Jackson served in the U.S. Army for four years and was deployed to Afghanistan. Using this information, he was able to track down his LinkedIn profile, where Jackson included a copy of his résumé, which has his email address. When one searches this email on Google, only one result comes up: a Russian hacking website which posted the personal information of video game players. The webpage showed that Jackson played the video game Assassins Creed II on PC, and used barris417 for his username. Type in barris417 on YouTube and an account with the name James Jackson pops up.

This attack is part of a massive surge in hate crimes in the past year, with the rise of far-right politicians like Donald Trump. In January, white gunman Alexandre Bissonnette massacred Muslims praying at a mosque in Quebec, Canada. His social media accounts and testimonies from classmates showed Bissonnette was a white nationalist, anti-feminist and staunch supporter of Trump, Marine Le Pen and other far-right demagogues.",1
"Nigel Garrett, 21, has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for assaulting a man because of the victim’s sexual orientation, the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Eastern District of Texas, and U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ Dallas Division announced.

According to the plea agreement, Garrett admitted that he, Anthony Shelton, and Chancler Encalade used Grindr, a social media dating platform for gay men, to arrange to meet the victim at the victim’s home.

Upon entering the victim’s home, the defendants restrained the victim with tape, physically assaulted the victim, and made derogatory statements to the victim for being gay.

The defendants brandished a firearm during the home invasion, and they stole the victim’s property, including his motor vehicle.

A federal grand jury previously had returned an eighteen-count superseding indictment, against Garrett, Shelton, Encalade and Cameron Ajiduah, that included charges for hate crimes, kidnappings, carjackings, and the use of firearms to commit violent crimes.

The indictment also charged the defendants with conspiring to cause bodily injury because of the victims’ sexual orientation during four home invasions in Plano, Frisco, and Aubrey, Texas, from January 17 to February 7, 2017.

Anthony Shelton, Chancler Encalade, and Cameron Ajiduah subsequently pleaded guilty to hate crime charges from this indictment, and all three await sentencing.

“Hate crimes are an attack on a fundamental principle of the United States to be free from fear of violence because of your sexual orientation, gender identity, race, color, religion, or national origin,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore of the Civil Rights Division.

“The Department of Justice is committed to using every tool at its disposal to combat this type of violence.”

“Violence, in any form, is an affront to the American principles of freedom and safety that our communities are entitled to,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Brit Featherston.

“The Department of Justice has made prosecution of violent crime a priority.”

“The Eastern District of Texas, in prosecuting this case and others like it, intends to demonstrate that this priority is something more than just a slogan.”

The investigation is being conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, the Plano Police Department, and the Frisco Police Department.

"The latest report by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University San Bernardino found that Los Angeles crimes against “protected classes” are up 15 percent — and the report’s author warned that it is rising hard-left violence on college campuses that is the fastest-growing hate.

Behavioral Sciences Professor Brian Levin of the Department of Criminal Justice at CSUSB found hate crimes in Los Angeles were up by 15 percent to 230 in 2016. That ranked L.A. as having the third-largest number of hate crimes in the nation 230 last year, far behind New York with 380 and Boston with 275.

But in a surprising comment for what has usually been a politically correct forum to attack conservative values, Levin told the Los Angeles County’s Network Against Hate Crime, headquartered in West Hollywood, that he is most worried about a rise in violent attacks by leftist Black Bloc, Antifa and other armed rioters that are using violence, assaults and vandalism to muzzle conservative free speech on college campuses.

The Los Angeles Daily News reported that Levin is worried that far-left groups are targeting police, journalists, campus venues, and Trump supporters. Regarding the far left’s motivations in the last year, he said, “They increasingly saw demonstrations less as an opportunity for expression, and more as the culmination of a pre-choreographed violent street or campus battle, that began as vitriolic disputes on social media.”

California Penal Code 422.6 PC makes it a misdemeanor, subject to up to a year in jail, to “willfully injure, intimidate, interfere with, or threaten someone in a protected class.” The definition of “protected classes” had been anyone that is not white, not male, not straight and not Christian. But Black Bloc and Antifa has specifically targeted conservatives at Berkeley and other University of California campuses.

Levin documented that in Los Angeles, the highest level of hate crime reports has been against blacks, followed by Jews, homosexual men, and then Hispanics. But the fastest growing targets are hate crime is now whites, which almost doubled from 7 to 12.

The CSUSB report comes just hours after 4chan crowd analysis identified former Diablo Valley College Philosophy Professor Eric Clanton as a masked Black Bloc activist who beat pro-Trump attendees with a U-shaped bike lock at the April 15 UC Berkeley riots.

Police arrested Clanton and he has been charged with four counts of felony assault with enhancements that allegedly caused great bodily injury, plus a misdemeanor for wearing a mask during commission of a crime. He pled not guilty and bail was set at $200,000.

A video of one of Clanton’s college lectures posted to You Tube features him with a Vladimir Leninist goatee giving a Marxist rant that property laws and policing only exists only for the benefit of the capitalist class to subjugate the public.",1
"A fire at a Jordanian restaurant in Wichita, Kan., could now be investigated as a hate crime after graffiti was discovered in the back of the restaurant with the warning, “Go Back.”

Owners Ranya Taha and Bashar Mahanwe woke up to a phone call at 2:10 a.m. Wednesday alerting them to a two-alarm fire at their business, Petra Mediterranean Restaurant. As the Wichita Eagle reports, the fire gutted the restaurant, laying to waste a year of the family’s hard work.

But it wasn’t until morning broke that Taha and Mahanwe found a possible motive for the fire: On the back of the restaurant, someone had written in large, black letters: “Go Back.”

“It was two words that have a lot of hate in it,” Taha told the paper.

The couple had just opened Petra restaurant in April and had gone through great pains to rebuild the space and bring in decor from Jordan and Turkey “to make it really feel like Jordan when you enter,” Taha said.

“My family, we worked so hard for peace, [to] build bridges. Basically bringing Wichitans closer together,” Taha told the Eagle.

“[The arsonists] didn’t like what we were doing. They wanted to burn this bridge,” she continued.

A spokesman for the Kansas City field office of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives told the Eagle that investigators are still looking into exactly how the fire started. Once they’ve determined the cause of the fire, they can decide whether the fire was a hate crime.

“The FBI is aware of the fire; if the investigation would turn into a hate crime investigation, then they would become more involved,” the spokesman, John Hamm, said.

Taha said that there was a “small incident” about three months ago, when someone vandalized a restaurant window, but “we just covered it up and moved on.”

“We didn’t think bad of it,” Taha told the Eagle.

Hate crimes nationwide have been on the rise since 2016, coinciding with Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. Among the most alarming increases have been attacks against Muslims and the Muslim community. The Council on American-Islamic Relations found a 91 percent rise in anti-Muslim hate crimes in 2017 compared with 2016, according to Newsweek.

"TEANECK, N.J. - A man robbed the 7-Eleven store at gunpoint late Saturday night, police said. A masked man, who police believe is black, walked into the Teaneck Road store, hopped over the counter, and brandished a large handgun, said Chief Robert A. Carney. The man held the gun to the cashiers head and demanded that he open the cash register drawer, Carney said. The cashier and another employee were too nervous to remember how to open the drawer so the man ripped the drawer from the register, hopped back over the counter, and left the store with it, Carney said.

"In our society, there are so many events it is sometimes difficult to keep up with them. In particular, we read about alleged hate crimes so often that they seem to have become normal.”

Yet we must make sure that this is not the case.

Earlier this year, we saw neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klansmen marching in Charlottesville, Virginia, and witnessed the death of an innocent woman, Heather Heyer.

Who would have believed that white supremacists have become so emboldened that they no longer wear hoods in public but proudly display their hate for the whole world to see? Anyone who witnessed that march of hate and who knows anything about history knows that we must take all hate crimes seriously.

On May 20, newly commissioned Army 2nd Lt. Richard Collins III, who was African-American, was fatally stabbed at a bus stop on the campus of the University of Maryland, College Park. A Severna Park native, Sean Urbanski, has been charged with the crime.

Lt. Collins was days away from his graduation at Bowie State University graduate. His promising future was cut short. Mr. Urbanskis trial is scheduled for early next year in neighboring Prince Georges County.

In a nine days, the so-called noose trial will start in Anne Arundel County Circuit Court, although it will involve only one of the original two defendants.

Conner Prout, 19, of Crofton, and John Havermann, also 19, of Pasadena, were charged with committing or conspiring to commit a hate crime after a May 11 incident in which a noose was hung from a light fixture outside a classroom at Crofton Middle School, whose student body is about 20 percent African-American and which has a black principal.

The arrests came after police reviewed video surveillance footage that showed two men on the school roof in the early morning hours.

Last week it was announced that Mr. Prout had accepted a plea agreement negotiated with the county branch of the NAACP, after State’s Attorney Wes Adams approached the organization’s leadership with the idea.

Instead of jail time, Mr. Prout was given 18 months of probation, which will include 120 hours of community service overseen by the NAACP. Writing about this arrangement in The Sunday Capital, the branch president, the Rev. Stephen A. Tillett, said he doubted imprisoning Mr. Prout would “result in the greater good for the community.”

At Mr. Prout’s sentencing, Judge J. Michael Wachs said he found it hard to believe the 19-year-old’s contention that he didn’t realize the noose had racist connotations.

As of this writing, the case against Mr. Havermann — who, according to an assistant state’s attorney, has admitted to being the instigator of the incident — is set to go to trial on Oct. 19. This case will be closely monitored by the public.

This evening at 6 the Caucus of African-American Leaders will meet at the Wiley H. Bates Legacy Center, 1101 Smithville St. in Annapolis. The meeting is open to the public and will serve to provide an update on these and other cases that have generated controversy and concern.

Both the Anne Arundel County branch of the NAACP and the Caucus of African-American Leaders have called on citizens to be patient as these cases move forward.

Nooses and swastikas are symbols that have been used to oppress, exploit, disenfranchise and kill people. The proponents of white supremacy are discovering that there are many people in this nation who will not allow them to take us back to a dark past.

We are determined that the future will be brighter for our children and grandchildren. Despite the actions of racists and anti-Semites, we boldly say A Luta Continua, which in Portuguese means that the struggle for racial equality, peace and justice continues!

"LOS ANGELES, CA — Los Angeles County prosecutors have asked the sheriffs department to conduct additional investigation before a decision is made on whether to file a criminal case against a 17-year-old student accused of making a shooting threat at El Camino High School in South Whittier, it was revealed Thursday. Authorities said the threat involving El Camino High was made Friday, two days after a former student at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, went on a campus shooting rampage that left 17 people dead. The El Camino student -- whose name was not released because of his age -- was reportedly upset with one of his teachers over a set of earphones and allegedly threatened to shoot up the campus, leading to a search of his home and the discovery of a cache of weapons, authorities said. On Wednesday, Los Angeles County Sheriff Jim McDonnell said investigators responded to a report by Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District resource officer Marino Chavez, who overheard the student threatening that he was going to shoot up the school sometime in the next three weeks. Chavez, whos been on the job for nearly three decades, told reporters that he took the teen to the schools office, where the boy confirmed the remark, prompting Chavez to contact the sheriffs department. He did say that he was just kidding, that he did not mean it, Chavez said. I said, Well, you cant say those things on a school campus. He was angry with the teachers issue about his (earphones) in class and he was not allowed to go to her class the next day, so he was supposed to go to the office, Chavez said. No weapons were found on the student at the time, officials said. McDonnell said deputies learned that the boy had an extensive discipline history at the school, and that a Smith & Wesson semi-automatic weapon was registered to his home address. Deputies served a warrant at the students home in Norwalk, and found two AR-15 rifles, two handguns and 90 high-capacity ammunition magazines, McDonnell said. The teens 28-year-old brother, Army veteran Daniel Eriberto Barcenas, was arrested for allegedly having an unregistered AR-15 rifle in the familys home. He was scheduled to be arraigned Thursday afternoon at the Bellflower courthouse on a misdemeanor count of possession of an assault weapon. The boy remains held in a juvenile detention facility, according to the sheriffs department. This is not unusual for prosecutors to ask for additional information before pursuing next steps in the legal process, according to a sheriffs department statement.

"Gulfport, FL — Two people face criminal charges after Gulfport Police found a 66-year-old woman dead in her home Friday night. According to the agency, police went to a home in the 5300 block of 29th Avenue South around 8:31 p.m. after receiving a call from the womans caregivers. The two caregivers, police said, lived with the woman and had cared for the victim for about eight months prior to her death. Police say the caregivers, Jennifer Susan Poulos, 41, and Debra Germaine Poulos, 61, failed to provide adequate care for the woman, especially medical care once they realized how frail she was. Police also say the home the woman lived in was in deplorable condition. The house was uninhabitable, extremely cluttered, and infested with roaches, an email from the agency said. One could not walk from room to room as there was no clear path. Both caregivers told police they moved out about 8 to 10 days before the womans death. Both Jennifer and Debra Poulos were charged with one count of neglect of an elderly or disabled adult. They were booked into the Pinellas County Jail. Jennifer Poulos also had a 4-year-old son living in the home for the last eight months. He was placed into the care of the Child Protective Investigations Division, police say.

"Hopkins residents were surprised over the weekend when they awoke to find thieves parked in underground garages along Blake Road and Hiawatha Avenue. Thefts can happen to anyone, but residents can still take action to tilt the odds in their favor. Police Sgt. Michael Glassberg offered these tips to discourage so-called car prowlers from targeting your vehicle. # 1: Take your valuables out of your car. Glassberg said this the most important action that residents can take to prevent break-ins. Most vehicle thefts are crimes of opportunity, he said. Thieves see a pricy electronic gadget—or a cord that suggests one might be there—and decide to get into the car. If they dont see anything, theyll often move on to the next car. And dont try to throw thieves off by hiding your valuables: You never know if people are watching or maybe they watched you another day, Glassberg said. #2: Dont lock valuables in your trunk after youve reached your destination. Criminals are often on the lookout at both inside and outside parking areas for people stashing expensive items out of sight. #3: Stay on the lookout for suspicious activity. Being observant helps police prevent thefts. Dont be shy about reporting any activity that you think is off. #4: Think carefully about locking your car. Glassberg said he, personally, is always careful to lock his car. But he added that it can be worthwhile to leave a vehicle unlocked in order to prevent damage that occurs during break-ins. After all, thieves will sometimes break into a vehicle even if they dont see anything valuable. That being said, be certain that you dont leave anything of value in the vehicle. This doesnt just mean property that thieves might want. It also means documents with personal information that could be used for identity theft. #5: Park in heavily trafficked areas. Thieves are wary of areas where people are most likely to see them breaking into vehicles. Look for the areas with the most eyes, and avoid places that are hidden away from public view. Underground parking garages, where the most-recent thefts took place, are particularly bad because there hidden from both sight and sound. Even secure garages can shelter thieves, who may follow residents inside the garage. Underground garages are havens for car prowlers, Glassberg said.",0

"(): Investigators have determined that grease ignited to cause the blaze that severely burned Wilson. Trooper Luke Nelson of the Pennsylvania State police said that Wilson had been cooking chicken at about 2:45 a.m. on Jan. 6 when his stove caught fire. Nelson said that evidence suggests that Wilson was injured when he attempted to put out the flames. Kirby Wilson, the running backs coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers, is being treated today for injuries after a fire early this morning swept through his townhouse in Seven Fields Borough. and firefighters from Adams Township, Cranberry, Callery Borough, Harmony Borough,  and South Butler County were dispatched to the blaze at around 2:45 a.m. in The Estates at Seven Fields, a townhouse community where Wilson lives at 141 Jameson Way. Neighbors said that smoke was pouring out of the house, and a maintenance man for the complex said that a stove may have caught fire in the kitchen. Wilson, 50, who was the only person in the townhouse, was badly burned. David VanAtta, who lives next door at 139 Jameson, said that the smell of smoke from the fire woke him and his mother, who lives with him. VanAtta, who said that he formerly was a volunteer firefighter, said that he called 911 after looking outside and seeing smoke. He ran outside and pounded on the door of Wilsons home. Another neighbor, Jim McCaffrey, said that he had just gotten home from his job as a mail handler at the U.S. Postal Service facility in Pittsburghs North Side area. I had just sat down, and I heard all this pounding, said McCaffrey, who lives across the street from Wilsons home. McCaffrey said that he heard VanAtta yelling for help and ran outside to join him until Wilson answered it. The men said that they talked with Wilson at the door, and Wilson repeatedly thanked them for rousing him. VanAtta said that Wilson was burned on his arms, legs and the back of his head and was wheezing from apparent smoke inhalation. He said Thank you about a million times, and also told the neighbors that he was fine, VanAtta said. The men said that they tried to keep Wilson conscious, speaking and on his feet, but they said that they were afraid to touch him because of the extent of his burns. As firefighters began arriving and attacking the flames, VanAtta said that they asked him to also roust other neighbors and get them out of their homes. A statement from the said that Adams firefighters quickly knocked out the fire. Cranberry firefighters cleared the scene at about 4:45 a.m. and were back in service by 6 a.m. Adams firefighters stayed on scene for about an hour after Cranberrys departure for clean-up operations. Cranberry Public Safety Director Jeff Schueler said that Wilson was transported to UPMC Passavant Hospital and then flown to UPMC Mercy Hospital. His condition is not fully known. Kirby has lived for at least two years in the townhouse community in Seven Fields, which is adjacent to Cranberry, neighbors said. We always talk to him about the Steelers and ask him if were going to win this time around, said McCaffrey. McCaffrey and other residents of the community describe Wilson as a friendly, good neighbor. The fires cause is not known. Alex Goetz, a part-time maintenance man for The Estates complex, said that he believes that the fire began in the kitchen and that a stove burner was left on. The three-story townhouse is severely damaged, and its windows are blown out. But it is still standing this morning. Blood stains are visible on the door jamb where Wilson gripped it after opening the door. Steelers President Art Rooney II said that team officials are praying for Wilson and his family. The team is scheduled to meet the Denver Broncos on Sunday in an NFL playoffs game in Denver. We are saddened to hear about this unfortunate situation, but we know that he (Wilson) has the best medical care in the country treating him, Rooney said in a statement. The entire organization is praying for Kirby to have a full recovery, and we will be by his side through this difficult time. A father of five, Wilson joined the Steelers in 2007 after spending 19 years as a college and professional coach, according to his official team biography. He previously coached running backs for the Arizona Cardinals (2004-06) and Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2002-03), where he also worked with Steelers Head Coach Mike Tomlin.

"A 27-year-old mans jaw was fractured when he was punched by a group yelling anti-gay slurs, police say. Wale Aliyu reports.

A man’s jaw was fractured after he was punched on the street in an early morning attack in Brooklyn that police are investigating as a possible hate crime.

The 27-year-old victim was ordering food with three of his friends at Crown Fried Chicken near Franklin and Fulton avenues when they were approached by a group of people in Bedford-Stuyvesant around 4 a.m. Saturday, police said.

The group began making anti-gay comments to the victim and his friends and when the victim tried to de-escalate the situation, he was punched in the face, according to police.

His jaw was fractured after the punch. He was at Brooklyn Hospital on Saturday night and he will likely have to undergo surgery on his face.

"A few years ago the Southern Poverty Law Center asked me if I would consider the Ex-Gay group Exodus International, a Hate Group. This conversion therapy umbrella organization dismantled itself four years ago, but during its heyday in the late Ninties and early Noughties, it not only proclaimed that change was possible for people gays or lesbians, it spoke out against hate crime legislation and equal rights for LGBTQ people. They did hateful things, but were they a hate group like the KKK and other white supremacist groups?

Beyond Ex-Gay Bearing witness outside Love Won Out Conference, Memphis, TN 2008

During the 17 years I received and endured conversion therapies, heterosexuality was preached as God’s ideal for all creation. Anything other than heterosexual partnerships, (within the context of marriage of course,) were considered inferior, immoral, and potentially dangerous, not only for the individual but to society at large. Most of the places where I received conversion therapy, the leaders used God and the Bible to uphold their 1950’s white suburban middle class family values. They expected everyone to adhere to strict gender guidelines. Therefore, much of the teachings we received were designed to transform us into “real” men and women. Technically most conversion therapists and ex-gay ministers do not believe there are any other people in the world beside gender normative heterosexuals. Transgender, bisexual, lesbian, gay, and gender non-conforming people are simply “normal” straight folks who are misbehaving and need to repent.

At large Love Won Out gatherings organized by Focus on the Family and Exodus International, success stories were trotted out on stage, replete with family photos displayed on big screens. For parents with an LGBTQ child, the message was crystal clear—Fear not, like these fine folks, your child can be saved from homosexuality! Of course many of the successful ex-gays on those stages have since come to their senses and are now out of the closet pursuing new lives as LGBTQ people. Some have even gone so far as to renounce their part in the Ex-Gay Movement. They have issued public apologies, and denounced the treatments they provided and promoted as dangerous.

Heterosexuality was prized and preached in the programs I attended. Many of these conversion therapy providers are not only anti-LGBTQ, they are also Straight Supremacists. They hold up heterosexuality as the ultimate goal and God’s best for our lives. Most of the people who have run these programs have been ex-gay themselves. Straight people also have played a part. At the Love in Action residency program I attended in Memphis, TN, a handful of heterosexuals served on staff along side the former gays and lesbians. These heterosexual men and women who never “struggled with same-sex attraction” were referred to as Ever Straights. They were the models we were told to follow.

No doubt I experienced harm at the hands of conversion therapists. They have and still do stir up trouble in people’s lives and families. They cause harm in churches, counseling sessions, and in society. Still it is not so simple to call them Hate Groups. Since so many of the people who run them are ex-gay themselves and live under the burden of gender norms and the aspiration to heterosexuality, they need to also be defined by the self-harm they perpetuate.

After spending time with the question, I replied to Southern Poverty Law Center. These ex-gay groups are not exactly like most hate groups, they operate as Self-Hate Groups. The revulsion and intolerance they have turned in on themselves spills over into the world. They then direct it towards all LGBTQ people.

I lived in that stew of hate and fear for nearly 20 years. The self-hatred ate at me like a cancer. I grew confused, anger, and suicidal. I was not stuck in the closet; I was trapped in a tomb. Coming out was not enough. I had to undo the destruction to my psyche. I needed therapy to address the damage caused by the unethical treatments I received, treatments that have been denounced by every major medical association in the world and are now illegal in some US states.

Besides traditional therapy, I needed to heal though new relationships with openly LGBTQ people, and I needed to learn about our history, and read our literature.

I also decided to return to the Bible to take matters into my own hands. Finding heroic gender non-conforming Bible characters is part of my way to counter the hate and lies I faced. These queer Bible characters along with LGBTQ heroes in history help me see that I come from a people—queer folk who have always been and always will be in the world despite hate and ignorance.

The violence continues against LGBTQ people in the USA and beyond. Therefore, we remain vigilant, resist, and look after each other. We have a lot of fight in us.",1

What to look for on Smart Talk Tuesday, August 22, 2017:

Several Democrats in the State House and faith leaders are calling for an expansion of Pennsylvanias hate crime laws.

Proposals in both the House and Senate would expand the offense of ethnic intimidation to include malicious intention against actual or perceived ancestry, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, gender or gender identity of another individual or group of individuals.

Lawmakers approved a similar expanded hate crime law with bipartisan support in the early 2000s but it was rejected by the State Supreme Court in 2008, because the bill was tacked onto unrelated legislation making it unconstitutional.

Rep. Dan Frankel (D-Allegheny) is leading the charge to expand the hate crime laws and appears on Tuesdays Smart Talk.

Also, a recent survey commissioned by the Pennsylvania Association of School Administrators (PASA) found that nearly 80% of the states 500 public school districts needed to access emergency reserve funds in the last year for routine expenditures like payroll and maintenance.

At the same time, many public schools are holding onto cash reserves - rainy day money - while receiving full budget funding from the state or even raising taxes.

PASA recommends districts maintain a rainy day fund balance between 5 and 12 percent of the districts operating costs. But, the Southern Fulton School District has a balance at 85% of its operating budget.

District administrators say surpluses are necessary to bridge funding gaps and for emergency spending. Jay Himes of the Pennsylvania Association of School Business Officials calls the surpluses the buffer of the unanticipated and I would say unbelievable situation that you may find yourself in in the course of a fiscal year.

Critics are concerned districts are hording cash. James Paul, a senior policy analyst with the Commonwealth Foundation called the figures eye-opening to anyone who believes Pennsylvania schools are underfunded.

On Tuesdays Smart Talk, we discuss the value of pumping up districts fund balances and whether they should be factored into the annual spending budgets of the schools with James Paul and John Callahan, Assistant Executive Director for Public Policy for the Pennsylvania School Boards Association.",1
"SAN FERNANDO VALLEY, CA – The public was urged today to be on the lookout for two men who posed as maintenance workers and burglarized two homes in the North Hollywood area last week while distracting the elderly occupants.

"AZUSA, CA - The charred remains of two people whose bodies were found atop a hill in a recently burned area of Angeles National Forest near Azusa were hoisted from the scene Friday, a day after a man found them while searching for his missing brother and cousin. It has not been confirmed that the bodies are those of Jonathan Pardo, 16, and his 31-year-old cousin, Carlos Perez. The two went missing after setting out on a hike just hours before the Reservoir Fire broke out on June 20, according to Jonathans older brother, Ricardo, who said he and family members made the grisly find. Firefighters were called about 2:20 p.m. Thursday to a scorched area along North San Gabriel Canyon Road, near Morris Dam above Azusa, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department. But the bodies were not immediately located. Members of the San Dimas Mountain Rescue Team, however, eventually reached the remains, which were significantly impacted by the effects of the fire, according to Los Angeles County sheriffs Deputy Trina Schrader. The terrain that theyre in, if that is them, theres no way to outrun a fire because they were uphill from the fire, Sheriffs Homicide Bureau Lt. Mike Rosson said today. Ricardo Pardo told reporters that he, along with family members and friends, had been searching for his brother and cousin ever since and faulted authorities for not treating the case more urgently. Me and my family members found the bodies, he told the Los Angeles Times. Its sad that police officers want credit when they didnt want to help at all. According Rosson, the actions taken by authorities upon learning of the missing were appropriate. The Reservoir merged with another blaze, the Fish Fire, to become the San Gabriel Complex Fire. — City News Service, photo courtesy of the LASD",0
"MARIETTA, GA -- A Marietta man convicted in the repeated rape of his young relative will spend the rest of his life behind bars, Cobb County District Attorney Vic Reynolds announced Thursday. Robert Lee Martin, 37, was sentenced in the courtroom of Cobb Superior Court Judge Robert D. Leonard II, who told the defendant, Its my intention that you never get paroled and die in prison. A Cobb jury convicted Martin on June 22 for molesting a girl in his family from the time she was 10 years old to age 14. (SIGN UP: Get Patchs Daily Newsletter and Real Time News Alerts. Or, if you have an iPhone, download the free Patch app.) The girl testified at the four-day trial, detailing the horrific abuse she endured for years at the hand of someone she trusted and felt a familial bond with. The judge told Martin that as a family member his job was to protect the girl, not prey on her. If you will do this to your own flesh and blood, youll do it to anybody, Leonard said. So, now it falls to me to protect her, and every other young girl in this community, as best I can. In my view, the best way to do that is to make sure you never walk around a free man in this community again. Prosecutors applauded the girl, who suffered in silence for years before mustering the courage to come forward in 2014 with her plight. The true hero in this case is the victim. This young girl stood up in the face of people who did not believe her and spoke the truth about what had happened to her, Assistant District Attorney David Williamson said. This verdict sends a message to this victim that she is believed. Martin was represented by Marietta attorneys Justin Wyatt and Joel Bergstrom. Image via Cobb Sheriffs Office",0

"The number of reported hate crimes increased nationally in 2016 for the second year in a row but the number dropped slightly in North Carolina.

Nationwide, investigating agencies reported 6,121 hate crimes against 7,615 victims in 2016, according to the FBI’s report released Monday. That’s compared to 5,850 hate crimes reported in 2015. More than 57 percent of the crimes reported in 2016 were motivated by a victim’s race, and more than half of those were committed against African Americans. Twenty-one percent were motivated by a religious bias, and 17.7 percent were motivated by a sexual orientation bias.

In North Carolina, investigators from 528 city, county, university and college police departments reported 148 hate crimes, a decrease from the 161 incidents reported in 2015.

The report says 99 of the crimes were related to a victim’s race, ethnicity or ancestry. Agencies across the state also reported 21 incidents motivated by a victim’s religion; 26 related to sexual orientation; and two related to gender identity.

The 4.6 percent nationwide increase over the previous year reflects a growing trend in hate crimes during and following the election of President Donald Trump, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, with many incidents reported by Muslims, blacks and Jews as well as LGBTQ people. The Southern Poverty Law Center also notes that there was a surge in incidents in the last three months of 2016.

U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has said hate crimes would be a top focus of his Justice Department, according to The Associated Press. In a statement Monday, he said he’s awaiting a task force report on steps the department can take to improve training for prosecutors and investigators, boost data collection on hate crimes and partner with local officials and communities. Sessions said the department will continue to aggressively prosecute people who violate the civil rights of others.

“The Department of Justice is committed to ensuring that individuals can live without fear of being a victim of violent crime based on who they are, what they believe, or how they worship,” Sessions said in a statement.

Hate crime victims can be individuals, businesses, government entities, religious organizations or society as a whole, and hate crimes can be committed against people, property or society.

Raleigh Police reported 28 incidents in 2016, 15 of them racially motivated, and Charlotte-Mecklenburg police reported 27, 16 of them connected to race. Universities and colleges in the state reported eight hate crimes.

The numbers are not considered exhaustive because they are based on voluntary reporting by almost 16,000 police agencies.

Civil rights groups have said the reporting should be made mandatory.

When the FBI was able to get information about perpetrators, 46 percent were white and 26 percent were black nationally.

Of the crimes that were motivated by a victim’s religion, more than half were against Jewish people and a fourth were against Muslims, according to the report.

Over the weekend, Saint Francis United Methodist Church on Kildaire Farm Road in Cary was vandalized with spray-painted racial slurs, “KKK” and other messages. Church members, staff and volunteers were able to clean the graffiti before morning service was finished Sunday.

"What are the most racist states in America by hate crimes in 2017? Insider Monkey has recently published an interesting article about it. Over the past few months, there have been numerous incidents, including violent clashes between white supremacists and supporters of the Antifa movement, such as it happened in Charlottesville. In fact, ever since Donald Trump has come into the office, racist-fuelled incidents have grown exponentially, as if his election as president has somehow given these people the green light to spew hate as never before. The fact that Trump has failed to denounce racism and extremism in his speeches, calling neo-nazis “nice people” may have also contributed.

Now without a further ado let’s see what Insider Monkey has investigated for us. We have picked three of the most racist states in America by hate crimes in 2017 from their list.

North Carolina is the first one on our list of the most racist states in America ranked by hate crimes in 2017 and it’s home to over 10 million people. According to statistics, white people make up 71% of the population, with people of black or African American origins accounted for just over 22%. Virginia ranks next on our list with over 8.4 million citizens. The Census Bureau notes that the state’s population is 70% white, with only 19.8% of the residents being of black or African American descent and 9.1% Hispanic or Latino. Virginia is, of course, famous for the most brutal hate-based incident this year – the clash from Charlottesville. The August far-right rally ended up with a State of Emergency being called. Kentucky is the last state on our list, that only has some 4.4 million residents. According to the US Census, white people make up 88% of the state’s population. Kentucky is also a state that has saw a hike in the number of hate groups following the 2016 elections, so the number of incidents in this category might also see a jump. Earlier this year, a man from North Carolina set fire to an Indian grocery store in east Charlotte and left a note at the scene signed with “White America.”",1
"Thirty-four years after a black man was brutally killed in Georgia, police have arrested five people ― including two law enforcement officials ― in connection with his slaying.

Bill Moore Sr., 58, and Frankie Gebhardt, 59, have been charged with murder, aggravated assault, aggravated battery and concealing a body, according to the Spalding County Sheriff’s Office.

Lamar Bunn, a 32-year-old employee of the police department in Milner, Georgia, and his mother, Sandra Bunn, 58, are charged with obstruction. Gregory Huffman, a 47-year-old detention officer with the sheriff’s department, is charged with obstruction and violation of oath of office.

The body of Timothy Coggins, 23, was found on Oct. 9, 1983, in a grassy area of Sunnyside, a small town about 30 miles south of Atlanta.

Spalding County Sheriffs Department Frankie Gebhard, left, and Bill Moore Sr. have been charged with murder, aggravated assault, aggravated battery and concealing a body.

Law enforcement authorities said they reopened the case in March after receiving new information about it.

The authorities said Coggins’ death was caused by multiple forms of trauma, without providing more detail.

“There is some misinformation out there that his body was hanged, but his body was not hanged,” Capt. Dwayne Jones of the sheriff’s office told HuffPost. “But we do feel as though there is a racial component, but I cannot release our reasoning for that.”

Sheriff Darrell Dix said investigators have “no doubt” the crime was racially motivated.

Timothy Coggins’ niece, Heather Coggins, told HuffPost her family is “extremely ecstatic” about the arrests.

“We’d thought they’d forgotten and that he really didn’t matter,” she said. “When we heard the news, we were just like, ‘Wow, they didn’t forget.’”

Spalding County Sheriffs Department Lamar Bunn, 32, Sandra Bunn, 58, and Gregory Huffman, 47, face charges in connection with the case.

Coggins’ activities prior to the discovery of his body have not yet been released. Authorities will only say his body was found about 10 miles from his home.

“Unfortunately, I can’t release that because that’s part of the integrity of the investigation,” Jones said.

Coggins’ niece said the condition of her uncle’s body necessitated a closed-casket funeral.

“Although he had a funeral, it wasn’t exactly a memorial because of everything that happened and the uncertainty,” she said.

“It was very difficult not knowing if they were ever going to come back and hurt our family,” she said. “Not knowing if they were our neighbors. Just the idea of not knowing. People were afraid.”

Heather Coggins The body of Timothy Coggins was found on Oct. 9, 1983.

While she was just 6 years old at the time of her uncle’s death, Coggins said she holds dear the memories she has of him and the stories that family members have shared. Her mother, she said, was his sister – one of four sisters and three brothers born to her grandparents.

“Whenever we were at my grandparents’ house you would pass his picture,” she said. “He was never forgotten by the family. He was an outgoing person, a joker, and a great dancer. Everyone who knew him knew how great of a dancer he was. He never met a stranger.”

Timothy Coggins parents, who both died in recent years, had suspicions about who was responsible, but were never able to prove anything, according to his niece.

“Although we grieved 34 years ago, the grieving process has started over again,” she said. “We still have a lot of unanswered questions, but now we can give him the memorial he deserves. People don’t have to be afraid to come because they’re afraid someone can hurt him. He’ll finally be able to rest in peace.”",1
"Progressive and civil rights groups are asking Anne Arundel County Councilman Michael Peroutka to make a public statement against racism after a white man from his district was charged in the stabbing death of a black Bowie State University student on the University of Maryland campus.

Police charged Sean Christopher Urbanski, 22, of Severna Park, with first- and second-degree murder in the death of 23-year-old Richard Collins III, who was set to graduate from Bowie State on Tuesday and was recently commissioned an Army second lieutenant. Urbanski, who graduated from Severna Park High in 2012, is being held without bail.

The FBI is investigating the homicide as a possible hate crime after discovering that Urbanski was a member of a Facebook group called Alt-Reich Nation.

Peroutka, R-Millersville, represents District 5 on the council, which includes Severna Park. He previously has been linked to the League of the South, a secessionist organization labeled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

The coalition of groups, which includes the Caucus of African American Leaders of Anne Arundel County and Anne Arundel County Indivisible, issued a statement Tuesday calling on Peroutka to introduce a council resolution condemning racism and white nationalism.

Balloons were released at the end of an event to honor Richard Collins III, held Monday at Bowie State University. Balloons were released at the end of an event to honor Richard Collins III, held Monday at Bowie State University. SEE MORE VIDEOS

Resolutions dont carry the weight of law but are a way for the council to make public statements on issues.

In a statement released Wednesday afternoon, Peroutka called Collins death a tragedy for which my family and I mourn but said he did not want to make it a political issue. He declined to elaborate on whether he would consider a resolution.

We pray that Christ may grant peace and comfort for Lt. Collins family and his friends and that justice will prevail in this case, Peroutka wrote. Regrettably, there are are some who seek to manipulate this familys tragic loss into political gain. In my view, this is insensitive and wholly inappropriate. He had no further comment.

News of Collins death and the charges against Urbanski follow the arrest earlier this month of two men police say placed a noose outside Crofton Middle School.

Yasemin Jamison, who founded the 800-member Anne Arundel County Indivisible, said the group reached out to other council members but is focusing on Peroutka because Urbanski is from Severna Park and because of the councilmans former membership in the league.

I just wonder if theres a connection with these young people saying the things that theyre saying and belonging to white supremacist groups, said Jamison, a constituent of Peroutkas. (Silence) just kind of sends a message to our county residents that I guess racism and the white supremacy ideology is acceptable here.

Caucus of African American Leaders convener Carl Snowden, a guest columnist for The Capital, said the councilman has a moral obligation to introduce the resolution. Other groups that joined in the request are Progressive Maryland, Action Annapolis, and Women Indivisible Strong and Effective.

The first-term councilman was heavily criticized during the 2014 election cycle for his membership in the League of the South. In October 2014, Peroutka announced he had left the league because he disagreed with statements members made in opposition to interracial marriage.

At the time, Peroutka said he still supported the groups stances on self-government and preserving Southern heritage.

Several Anne Arundel County officials have already released statements about Collins stabbing.

County Executive Steve Schuh, a Republican, posted a comment about the homicide on his Facebook page Tuesday.

On behalf of Anne Arundel Countys nearly 600,000 residents, our hearts and prayers are with the Collins family and the communities at Bowie State University and the University of Maryland College Park, the statement read. Hatred has no place in a civilized society.

Gone to (sic) soon, posted Councilman Pete Smith, D-Severn. Breaks my heart to know his true potential will never be reached.

Tuesday night, Councilman Jerry Walker, R-Crofton, posted that The family of Richard Collins III has been in my prayers all day!

Marylands U.S. Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, both Democrats, issued a joint statement expressing condolences for Collins family and welcoming the FBIs involvement in the investigation.

The senselessness of this loss is deeply disturbing, as are reports that the perpetrator may have been motivated by racism, the statement read.

U.S. Rep. Anthony Brown, a Democrat who represents parts of Anne Arundel and Prince Georges counties, took to the House floor Wednesday to condemn Collins killing and call for elected officials to take a stand.

This tragedy exposes a dangerous rising tide. This incident was not some random act of violence. It was a heinous, despicable and unprovoked crime of hate, Brown said. If this escalation of hate is going to end in Maryland and across the country, itll be because all of us take a stand. Not only against the hard right and hate festering on campus, but to leaders that have been too content to remain silent and look the other way.",1
"Jan. 28, 2017 — I specifically recall running into my mom’s room, telling her that for some reason, I felt the sudden urge to go visit the IMAM foundation mosque in Los Angeles. This place was a staple of my childhood, the hub of all of my 6-year-old social activity and an optimal location for the best Persian deserts.

Jan. 29, 2017 — I was filled with horror as my mom told me that six people were shot and killed at a mosque in Quebec City, Canada.

“This could have been us, Kimia,” my mom said with remorse, then declared that we couldn’t step foot into our place of worship as long as Islamophobic hate crimes continued to plague us.

Despite being a Muslim, I can assure everyone that I am affected very little in comparison to my more religious Muslim brothers and sisters who see their mosques as a home — a home that’s been broken into, one that they can no longer feel safe in. And while this situation might feel very far away for some, it’s very much real and legitimate. Researches at California State University analyzed data over 20 states, discovering that there have been over 196 reported incidents of hate crimes against Muslims in 2015, a 78 percent increase since the prior year. While this may feel like simply a number, these are individual people being affected by others’ hate.

“ This grotesque image felt branded in my brain and the thought that any of these people could have been me or my family was terrifying enough to understand why my mom wanted me to stay away from my mosque.”

Now, I will be completely honest with you. I’ve never considered myself a religious person. I don’t wear a hijab, I don’t fast for Ramadan and I’ve never actually prayed five times in one day.

Celebratory Islamic traditions and Persian cultural customs are the practices I actually carry out. Celebrations for the new year, opportunities to eat a lot of delicious food and chances to spend time with my family are what have allowed me to continue calling myself a Muslim.

June 18, 2017 — 17-year-old Nabra Hassanen was beaten to death with a baseball bat by Darwin A. Martinez Torres when going to a Virginia fast-food restaurant after a late-night event with her friends at the mosque. She didn’t provoke anybody or cause anyone harm, but it was her body that was found in a ditch late that night.

This grotesque image felt branded in my brain and the thought that any of these people could have been me or my family was terrifying enough to understand why my mom wanted me to stay away from my mosque.

“ The swarms of individuals rallying and protesting at airports after President Trump released Executive Order 13769 … acts as a testament to the fact that the American people are still on our side.”

These cases speak nothing to the daily biases and cases of harassment that occur for Muslim men and women.

Hasan Minhaj, notable Muslim comedian, recalls in his Netflix comedy show “Homecoming King” that after the horrible attacks of 9/11, boys in his neighborhood threw rocks at his family’s car windows and told him they were “coming after him.” The fact that he was willing to discuss something as serious as Islamophobia on a platform based on humor confirms how serious Muslim hate crimes have been and remain to be.

So, while I write this article in part as a message to everyone in the student body and beyond to utilize their privilege and voices to advocate for the oppressed beyond the scope of Islamophobia, I also write to remind all the Muslim individuals reading this that they are not alone in this uphill battle. The swarms of individuals rallying and protesting at airports after President Trump released Executive Order 13769, which detained and banned citizens of some typically Muslim populated countries, acts as a testament to the fact that the American people are still on our side. In all the bad news, these admirable actions provide us all with a sliver of hope.",1

"Report highlights statewide crime data on hate crimes – Total number of hate crimes, victims, and suspects all increased in 2016

(From Press Release) – Attorney General Xavier Becerra today released the 2016 edition of the California Department of Justice (DOJ) Hate Crime in California report. The Hate Crime in California report provides statistics on hate crimes that occurred statewide during 2016, including the number of hate crime events and both the number of victims and suspects of those crimes. The DOJ, all law enforcement agencies, district attorneys, and elected city attorney’s offices in California, developed local data collection programs and submitted hate crime statistics for this edition of Hate Crime in California. The DOJ also provides trend information on the number and types of hate crimes over the past ten years.

“When someone commits a crime motivated by hate, it is not just an attack on one innocent person, but an attack on the entire State and our communities,” said Attorney General Becerra. “We can see from today’s report that words matter, and discriminatory rhetoric does not make us stronger but divides us and puts the safety of our communities at risk. This is why condemning hate crimes, discrimination, and racism is critical to ensuring all Californians live without fear of being targeted because of their race, ethnicity, religion, disability, gender or sexual orientation. As California’s Attorney General, I am committed to working with local law enforcement agencies, schools and local communities to enforce California’s anti-hate crime statutes to the fullest extent of the law. I strongly encourage anyone who believes they are a victim of a hate crime to report it to local law enforcement immediately.”

The increase in hate crimes in California comes at a time when the nation is confronting an unsettling increase in hate crimes. The latest reports from the Federal Bureau of Investigation



demonstrate an increase in the number of hate crimes nationwide, including crimes motivated by biases towards racial and ethnic minorities, Muslims, persons with disabilities, women, immigrants, and the LGBT community. Last week it was reported that from 2011-2015, more than half of violent hate crime victimizations were not reported to police.

Hate Crime in California 2016 reports statistics on hate crimes that occurred in California during 2016, including the following key findings:

Over the last ten years, the total number of hate crime events has decreased 34.7% from 1,426 in 2007 to 931 in 2016.

Hate crime events increased 11.2% from 837 in 2015 to 931 in 2016.

Hate crime events involving a racial basis increased 21.3% from 428 in 2015 to 519 in 2016.

Hate crime events with a race/ethnicity/national origin bias are consistently the most common type of hate crime over the past ten years (2007-2016). Hate crimes with a sexual orientation bias are the second most common type of hate crime over the same period.

Hate crimes with an anti-black or African American bias motivation continue to be the most common hate crime, accounting for 31.3% (3,262) of all hate crime events since 2007.

Hate crimes with a sexual orientation bias are the second most common type of hate crime over the last ten years, accounting for 22.2 percent of hate crimes report in 2016.

Hate crimes with an anti-gay (male) bias increased 40.7% from 108 in 2015 to 152 is 2016.

Hate crimes with an anti-Jewish motivation continue to be the most common within the religion bias category, accounting for 11.1% (1,158) of all hate events reported since 2007.

Attorney General Becerra encourages researchers, academics and interested parties to further analyze the data. The information from the Hate Crime in California report can be accessed via the Attorney General’s OpenJustice website.

Since its launch in September 2015, OpenJustice, a first-of-its-kind criminal justice open data initiative that releases unprecedented data, established California as a leader among US states in criminal justice transparency. Additionally, the OpenJustice Data Act of 2016 (Assembly Bill 2524), effective January 1, 2017, codified the OpenJustice Web portal as the means for displaying all data contained in annual crime reports, thereby making OpenJustice a key government resource for Californians. By driving research, reporting, and conversation, OpenJustice can help Californians better understand how the criminal justice system shapes various aspects of their lives, from safety, housing, education, health, and family, to economic opportunity.

"Eating the Evidence: A man pulled over for suspicion of DUI by a Loganville Police Department officer was seen chewing on a green leafy substance. Wonder what that was? The suspect refused to open his mouth and continually turned away from the officers eyes, but he still got pinched for drug possession. The officer found a bundle of white pills hidden in the mans underwear. Nicotine Fits: They say cigarettes are like money in jail, which is exactly where three people found themselves after a dispute over some missing smokes. A Winder man didnt have proof that a Dacula man he knew had taken some of his cigarettes, so he did what he thought was logical — he took the mans guitar and put it in his car just to make a point. To retaliate, the guitar owner and an accomplice scratched a sexual drawing and expletives on the Winder mans car. All three were arrested. Yapping Leads to Gun Confrontation: A exchange of words outside a Dacula-area QuikTrip on Christmas Eve led to two men going to their vehicles to get their guns. Inside the convenience store, one of the men told the clerk to stop yapping, to which the second man, a Buford resident, replied, Dogs yap, Im a grown man. The jawing kept going outside, where the first man went to his Porsche Cayman, grabbed his gun and pointed it at the Buford man, who went to his truck to get his piece. The suspect then drove away. No shots were fired. Not Sticker-Shocked: A bumper sticker on a 1999 Chevrolet Suburban was holiday-inspired — Love God. Love People. But that didnt keep it from being stolen from a Peachtree Corners driveway on Christmas Eve. This for $15? A Sandy Springs woman visiting at a Peachtree Corners apartment complex was a victim of an armed robbery in the parking lot. The suspect held a gun to her head and ran away with 15 bucks. Pizza News: Checking out news from the Athens-Clarke County Police is always a treat. In one case, a pizza delivery man attempted to deliver a fake order to an apartment. He was then approached by a suspect who took the pizza, asked for change for $100, then robbed him. More than a pie was taken when a .

"ELGIN, IL — Elgin Community College is getting a new police chief as longtime St. Charles Deputy Police Chief Dave Kintz accepted the position at the college. Kintz said hes looking forward to the new job, Kane County Connects reported, as he thanked local media for their part in keeping citizens informed. Kintz used to be the St. Charles police departments public information officer, acting as the buffer between the police department and journalists. Connects reported him as saying the most difficult case of his career was the Coffland shooting earlier in March 2017, in which a man shot and killed his two daughters, shot his wife in the leg then turned the gun on himself. I always tell people who watched the coverage and followed the articles that working with all of you was the easiest part of the entire case, he told area journalists. I appreciate the patience and professionalism you extended to me knowing that this was a high profile case that garnered national attention. My goal has always been to get you the information you need quickly and accurately. I always tried to be open and responsive to all of your requests, knowing that all of us just had a job to do, he wrote, Kane County Connects reported. I hope that came across in my service levels, whether it was an on-camera interview, simply checking on the status of a case, or an after-hours response for crash information, I tried to assist where I could.

"In the wake of an attack on a Chesterfield student on the campus of St. Louis Community College-Meramec and its subsequent mishandling by the university, St. Louis County Police Chief Tim Fitch is urging schools to be more aggressive in their treatment of suspects in criminal incidents. Writing in his blog, Fitch said that part of the problem is that educational institutions often would rather handle crimes as school violations instead of notifying police. This goes on more than you realize, Fitch wrote. Schools, like most instiutions that rely on public support for funding, do not want to look bad or admit they have problems for fear that their next bond issue or tax increase might not pass. Fitch then specifically referenced his home district of Rockwood as an example of how bad publicity can doom a bond issue. The districts $38.4 million Prop S failed to pass this spring following controversy created by a state audit and the subsequent resignation of a school board member. In the case of the Meramec attack, the college came under fire for not immediately alerting students about the assault and was also criticized for briefly releasing the suspect, Jevon Mallory, 18, who was eventually charged in connection to the incident. The controversy culminated on Monday, when SLCC-Meramec President George Wasson announced his resignation from the post. The president of SLCC-Wildwood will take over in an interim capacity. Fitch, who said his daughter attends SLCC-Meramec, wrote that it was likely that the attack would have gone unreported if the victims family hadnt gone to the media. As Patch previously reported, 19-year-old Blythe Grupe of Chesterfield, said she was attacked in a womens restroom on campus April 18. An instructor heard Grupes screams, ran into the bathroom, which stopped the alleged assault, and then called campus police. Fitch said the issue of schools downplaying criminal incidents in hopes of avoiding negative publicity is longstanding. He gave several examples from his career in law enforcement: There was a time a few years ago when we had to threaten a local school superintendent and principal with prosecution under the Missouri Safe Schools Act for failing to report acts of violence in their school to police authorities.  They didnt take us seriously until we brought a prosecutor to the school to let them know we (and the Prosecuting Attorneys Office) meant business.  Things have gotten much better in that district since then.  I saw the same resistance from some districts when we started our heroin initiative in 2010 and asked to hold Town Hall meetings in school auditoriums.  One local district chastised me for even suggesting that schools were in denial about their drug problems. He ended the blog post by noting that serious crimes such as the Meramec assault are infrequent and suggested that in the future, SLCC promptly turn over any felony crime to the Kirkwood Police, an agency that would not be beholden to image-conscious bosses at the campus.",0

"A gay teen says she was attacked at her California high school by a group of students who hurled juice boxes at her and shouted homophobic slurs.

Logann Pruneda said that she’s often been the target of bullying since she came out in seventh grade, but the torment escalated Monday on her 16th birthday, the Fresno Bee reported.

The Bullard High student claimed the group called her “a f–got, a queer and a lesbo” and pelted her with full juice boxes at the Fresno school.

Pruneda said the attack left her with bruises on her neck and back.

“They were pretty hard throws,” she told the Fresno Bee. “All I heard was them calling me really mean names that involved my sexuality.”

She said that she did not see who was involved in the assault.

Fresno police have reached out to the public in an effort to help identify the suspects.

“It’s an assault that can also be investigated as a hate crime based upon sexual orientation as a substantial motivating factor,” spokesman Mark Hudson told the Fresno Bee. “Once we are able to obviously speak to a person who’s willing to talk to us, who committed the crime, then we’ll have more evidence to try and move a case forward. We’re asking for students’ help in identifying who assaulted her.”

Fresno Unified school officials is investigating the alleged attack, but claimed that there were no witnesses to the incident.

The school district added that there are no security cameras in the area where the attack occurred.

“This incident is clearly disturbing and does not honor the standard we expect all our students to adhere to at Fresno Unified,” spokeswoman Jessica Baird said in a statement. “Principal Castillo is reinforcing the high standards our students are expected to follow, ensuring Bullard High continues to be a safe campus for all students.”",1

"I contacted Lakewood Police spokesman Chris Lawler today about additional information regarding Specifically, I asked him this question: 1) Does the city plan to do anything about the animals, i.e., close down the area, trap them? Here was his response: Since this was an isolated incident and not totally unprovoked, we have no plans to do anything with the raccoons/area unless we have another incident. This was a person with a dog interacting with wildlife that was probably protecting its young. Ive notified our parks department and animal control will also be monitoring the area. Our animal control has already spoke with Fish and Wildlife and they concur no additional action is needed right now.  If we have another incident, then we will consider further action, such as trapping them and/or closing off the area. Also, Lawler shared a link from the state Department of Fish & Wildlife that provided some tips about raccoons: Dont feed raccoons. Feeding raccoons may create undesirable situations for you, your children, neighbors, pets, and the raccoons themselves. Raccoons that are fed by people often lose their fear of humans and may become aggressive when not fed as expected. Artificial feeding also tends to concentrate raccoons in a small area; overcrowding can spread diseases and parasites. Finally, these hungry visitors might approach a neighbor who doesnt share your appreciation of the animals. The neighbor might choose to remove these raccoons, or have them removed. Dont give raccoons access to garbage. Keep your garbage can lid on tight by securing it with rope, chain, bungee cords, or weights. Better yet, buy garbage cans with clamps or other mechanisms that hold lids on. To prevent tipping, secure side handles to metal or wooden stakes driven into the ground. Or keep your cans in tight-fitting bins, a shed, or a garage. Put garbage cans out for pickup in the morning, after raccoons have returned to their resting areas. Feed dogs and cats indoors and keep them in at night. If you must feed your pets outside, do so in late morning or at midday, and pick up food, water bowls, leftovers, and spilled food well before dark every day. Keep pets indoors at night. If cornered, raccoons may attack dogs and cats. Bite wounds from raccoons can result in fractures and disease transmission. Prevent raccoons from entering pet doors.  Keep indoor pet food and any other food away from a pet door. Lock the pet door at night. If it is necessary to have it remain open, put an electronically activated opener on your pets collar. Note: Floodlights or motion detector lights placed above the pet door to scare raccoons are not long-term solutions. Put food in secure compost containers and clean up barbecue areas. Dont put food of any kind in open compost piles; instead, use a securely covered compost structure or a commercially available raccoon-proof composter to prevent attracting raccoons and getting exposed to their droppings. A covered worm box is another alternative. If burying food scraps, cover them with at least 8 inches of soil and dont leave any garbage above ground in the area—including the stinky shovel. Placing a wire mesh barrier that is held in place with a heavy object over the in-ground compost will prevent problems. Clean barbecue grills and grease traps thoroughly following each use. Eliminate access to denning sites. Raccoons commonly use chimneys, attics, and spaces under houses, porches, and sheds as den sites. Close any potential entries with ¼-inch mesh hardware cloth, boards, or metal flashing. Make all connections flush and secure to keep mice, rats, and other mammals out. Make sure you dont trap an animal inside when you seal off a potential entry (see Evicting Animals from Buildings). For information on securing chimneys, see Raccoons in Dumpsters and Down Chimneys. Prevent raccoons from accessing rooftops by trimming tree limbs away from structures and by attaching sheets of metal flashing around corners of buildings. Commercial products that prevent climbing are available from farm supply centers and bird-control supply companies on the Internet. Remove vegetation on buildings, such as English ivy, which provide raccoons a way to climb structures and hide their access point inside.

The federal civil rights investigation into the weekend violence that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia, could involve domestic terrorism and hate crime charges and isn’t limited to the driver who plowed his vehicle into a crowd of people, according to the Trump administration.

Speaking on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Monday, “It does meet the definition of domestic terrorism in our statute.”

In a fact sheet, the administration mentioned both possibilities. But a hate crimes case would be easier to bring because domestic terrorism cases involve a much higher burden for prosecutors, said Horace Cooper, a former constitutional law professor at George Mason University.

A hate crime is an act of violence targeted at someone because of their identity—and it must be a legally protected class to be prosecuted. Domestic terrorism is violence intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population.

The government has determined it has evidence to be suspicious that the suspect intended to send a message and not just harm immediate victims, according to the administration.

The key target of the investigation will almost certainly be 20-year-old James Fields Jr., the driver of the Dodge Challenger that charged into a crowd of counter-protesters, injuring 19 people and killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer.

Federal investigations could become more expansive to include anyone who might have lied or tried to cover up for Fields. This could include an obstruction or conspiracy charge for others, Cooper said.

“You would have to prove a conspiracy in advance to make it easy to prove other people were involved,” Cooper told The Daily Signal.

Other incidents of riots or assaults would likely be prosecuted at the local level, Cooper said.

State prosecutors have already charged Fields with second-degree murder, among other charges, while the federal government is gathering additional evidence.

It’s also more likely to be a hate crimes probe than a terrorism charge, said Cooper, who previously was chief counsel for House Majority Leader Dick Armey and is now the co-chairman of Project 21, a black conservative advocacy group.

But, he noted, hate crimes aren’t easy to prosecute. In this case, Fields’s defense lawyer could argue about the identity of the victim killed, because Heyer, a white female, isn’t the primary target of Fields, reportedly a neo-Nazi.

“The dead person in this case doesn’t necessarily meet the animosity of the alleged perpetrator,” Cooper said. So a defense attorney could contend, “Was it racial supremacy views or was it road rage?”

President Donald Trump met at the White House Monday with Sessions and FBI Director Christopher Wray about the investigation into the rally by white supremacists that led to clashes with counter-protesters and three fatalities.

“To anyone who acted criminally in this weekend’s racist violence, you will be held fully accountable. Justice will be fully delivered,” Trump said after his meeting.

He later added, “As a candidate, I promised to restore law and order to our country and our federal law enforcement agencies are following through on that pledge. We will spare no resource in fighting so that every American child can grow up free from violence and fear.”

Acting U.S. Attorney Rick Mountcastle is leading the investigation, along with his career staff in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section and the FBI. The probe will not be limited to the man who drove into a crowd, killing a woman, but will also investigate whether others were involved in planning the attack.

“We will continue to support our state and local officers on the ground in any way possible,” Sessions said in a statement Saturday. “We stand united behind the president in condemning the violence in Charlottesville and any message of hate and intolerance. This kind of violence is totally contrary to American values and can never be tolerated.”

On another front, a federal prosecutor could bring interstate charges for those at the rally carrying guns, Cooper said. While Virginia is an open-carry, the law doesn’t apply to those who are residents from jurisdictions that don’t allow open-carry.

“A federal investigation can sweep up matters to include unrelated incidents,” Cooper said.

Two other fatalities at the scene of the Charlottesville riots were Virginia State Police troopers H. Jay Cullen, 48, and Berke Bates, 40, who were killed in a helicopter crash while policing the rally. But authorities reportedly don’t suspect foul play.

Federal investigators should look into how state and local police monitored the rally, said Stacy Washington, also a co-chairwoman of Project 21. She noted that the left-wing group Antifa, also known for violent disruptions, seemed to be too close to the white nationalists,

“We are talking about a clash of the morons, white nationalists and Antifa. They represent a fringe of America,” Washington, a talk radio host and Air Force veteran, told The Daily Signal.

"GLENDALE -- A 17-year-old Milwaukee resident has been charged as an adult after leading police on a high-speed chase through the North Shore and nearly striking an officer with a stolen car. According to police, Glendale police officer came across a stolen Acura with a dealer plate attached parked in the lot of the Motel 6 on Port Washington Rd. on Dec. 29. When the officer approached the Acura to obtain its VIN number, he observed several people that appeared to be asleep in the cabin. When he tried to get the attention of the sleeping youth inside, one of the occupants, later identified as 17-year-old Deangelo Griffin, slid into the driver seat and turned on the car, the complaint stated. According to the complaint, Griffin manuevered the Acura into reverse, causing the officer to jump out of the way as it collided with his squad car. Griffin struck the squad car again, and two more parked cars in the lot before speeding away. A high-speed chase resulted, as the Acura driven by Griffin reached 80 miles per hour through Glendale. Police deployed tire-piercing stop sticks, which resulted in slowing the car to 60 miles per hour as it reached Silver Spring Road from Port Washington Road, the complaint stated. According to his criminal complaint, Griffin approached Green Bay road, he reportedly encountered heavy traffic and pulled into a parking lot on N. 20th St. near a Dollar General where he abandoned the vehicle. Officers in the three pursuing squads engaged in a foot chase, where he was quickly apprehended. Two additional passengers were also located. Griffin, 17, has been charged with three felonies - operating a motor vehicle without the owners concent eluding a traffic officer and second-degree recklessly endangering safety. When officers asked why Griffin fled, he told police he had municipal warrants out against him and he did not want to get caught, according to his complaint. If convicted, he could face up to nine-and-a-half years behind bars. >>> image via patch.com",0

"Taxpayers will contribute $1.73 million into firefighters pension fund, after approval in a unanimous vote by the three-member board of directors of Monarch Fire Protection District last Wednesday. The Monarch district, headquartered in Chesterfield, also covers portions of , Ballwin, Creve Coeur, Clarkson Valley and Maryland Heights. The $1.73 million was paid to DWS Sudder, according to the district documents projected on a screen at Wednesdays meeting. The board had a closed pension meeting prior to the regular meeting. The district pays into the pension an average of $14,000 per person, board member Robin Harris said. Apparently, the pension payment is the same as the prior year, because it is not an assessment year when resident real property taxes may fluctuate based on property values; that happens every two years. In other business, Monarch board members approved payment of $106,000 for producing 59 checks. In a previous meeting, board president Kim Evans encouraged district staff to look into digital production of check stubs to save money. Payroll checks are produced every two weeks. The district plans a new website, after about 10 years without a redesign. The board agreed to spend $3,250 with CMS Express.com on Chief Tom Vineyards recommendation, after looking into several companies. Assistant Fire Chief John Borgmann said the new website would be very interactive. He said a team of Monarch employees would be updating the site, adding photos, and other items. Evans asked for information about community resources in emergencies to be added to the new site. The website would be similar to one the same company designed for Sedona Fire District, in Arizona. Borgmann also said the designers suggested a new logo.",0

"History Repeating Itself Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images Video

Terre Haute - Charlottesville. Barcelona. Boston.

Evidence of how hate can divide a community and can lead people to do the unthinkable.

Jean Kristeller recently visited Auschwitz in Poland with local Holocaust survivor Eva Kor.

She found it ironic, the connection she found between the historic horror site and the recent events our world has encountered.

It brought home the overwhelming focus of killing people as a solution to issues that were there in Germany, said Kristeller.

Kristeller presented her journey in Poland to the members of the Unitarian Universalist Church in Terre Haute.

She brought more than a history lesson but a warning to how similar she found the recent hate crimes to the motive of the Holocaust.

That anybody would say that the solution to the problems that we are having in our community economically, in terms of moving forward, has to do with killing a group of individuals. Children, women, men, just because they have this ethnic identity, it simply makes no sense what so ever, said Kristeller.

Cathy Mcguire is a member of the church as well as an active community member in protesting against fascism.

She was present in the recent vigil in Terre Haute in response to the Charlottesville riot.

I dont think we can accomplish anything through violence. We certainly dont want another, another civil war, and that is what violence can bring. And I think it is important for local communities to stand up. Because most people are not white supremacist most people are not extremist, said Mcguire.

Kristeller felt compelled to share her travels with the members of the church because she says regardless of religion, history is something that should never be forgotten.

If you dont remember it, you are doomed to repeat it. This is something we do not want to repeat, ever, said Kristeller.

Both women believe that violence is not the answer to the problem that these communities are facing, that killing is taking leaps backwards in efforts of making our world a more peaceful and cohesive place.",1

A North Carolina man was arrested and charged with a hate crime for perpetrating a scooter attack on two gay men in Key West.

The Onslow County Sheriff’s Office took Brandon Ray Davis, 30, into custody on March 1. He is awaiting extradition to Key West where he faces a felony charge of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.

According to a police report, Kevin Seymour and Kevin Price were riding bicycles on Duval Street when they spotted Davis driving erratically on a scooter. When the men alerted Davis he had almost hit a vehicle, Davis launched into a tirade against the men, calling them “fags” and knocking Seymour to the ground.

Davis allegedly attempted to justify this behavior by announcing, “you live in Trump country now.” Also Davis, allegedly told Seymour “I’ll cut you up” if he contacted the police.

Detectives with the Key West Police Department were able to identify Davis partly through the scooter rental agency where he left a copy of his driver’s license. The victims noted the scooter’s license plate before the suspect fled the scene.

As to the hate crime charge, cops believe “probable cause exists to believe there was evidence of prejudice in Davis’ attack of Seymour,” said Alyson Crean, public information officer for the Key West Police Department. “(Davis) used explicit bias language in reference to their sexual orientation. Davis then attacked Seymour without any provocation.”

The Jacksonville (N.C.) Daily News reports Davis is fighting extradition and out of jail on a $10,000 bond.",1
"A 31-year-old Costa Mesa woman was sentenced today to nearly six years in federal prison for operating a foreclosure rescue fraud scheme that targeted homeowners with bogus promises of mortgage relief. Najia Jalan was ordered to pay restitution of about $236,000 and serve three years of supervised release following her 70-month prison term, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office. She pleaded guilty in July in Los Angeles to mail fraud and aggravated identity theft charges. Jalan -- who is not a licensed attorney -- used company names such as the National Legal Help Center, United National Mortgage Protection Center, OC NonProfit, American Consumer Law Center to trick victims into paying her substantial fees for fake services, prosecutors said. Jalan also created various aliases to attract struggling homeowners by deceptively promising foreclosure relief or mortgage modifications to make consumers payments substantially more affordable, court papers show. Promising to obtain results within a certain period of time, she charged homeowners unlawful advance fees, ranging from $1,000 to $3,000 and in some cases more than $10,000, prosecutors said. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sued Jalan and a co-defendant in 2012 in connection with the National Legal Help Center, which falsely claimed that they would provide legal representation for consumers even though the defendants were not attorneys and consumers received no actual legal representation, according to the agency. -City News Service",0

Two Brooklyn Men Charged with Assault as a Hate Crime for

Alleged Unprovoked Attack on Rabbinical Student



Victim was Walking Home from the Chabad-Lubavitch World Headquarters in Crown Heights

Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez today announced that two Brooklyn men have been indicted for assault as a hate crime and other charges in connection with an alleged attack against a Jewish rabbinical student who was walking home at night in Crown Heights. The defendants did not take any property or cash, including a charity box the victim was holding, and allegedly stated that they were irritated because he was speaking in Hebrew on the phone – leading to the hate crime charges.

District Attorney Gonzalez said, “We allege that these defendants decided to assault a man for the sole reason that he looked different than them and spoke a different language. I will never tolerate bias-motivated crimes in Brooklyn, and will investigate and prosecute them vigorously. Our strength is in our diversity.”

The District Attorney identified the defendants as Darren Morgan, 20, of Prospect-Lefferts Gardens, and Justin George, 19, of Brownsville. They were arraigned today before Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Martin Murphy on an indictment in which they are charged with third-degree assault as a hate crime, third-degree menacing as a hate crime, third-degree assault and other related offenses. They were ordered to return to court on August 14, 2018. The defendants face up to four years in prison if convicted of the top count.

The District Attorney said that, according to the investigation, just past midnight on May 1, 2018, the victim, a 22-year-old Lubavitch rabbinical student, was walking home from his studies at 770 Eastern Parkway, which is the Chabad-Lubavitch World Headquarters. He felt that he was being followed and turned the corner at Albany Avenue and President Street, where the two defendants caught up to him, the evidence showed.

The defendants then allegedly punched him and, as he tried to get away, grabbed him, threw him against a car and repeatedly punched him in the face and body. The victim dropped a charity box containing over $200 that he was carrying, but it was left untouched, and the defendants did not demand any money or property, including a cell phone the victim was carrying, according to the evidence. The victim suffered bruising and swelling to his face.

As the assault continued, a police car drove by, prompting the defendants to flee. They were apprehended a short time later after the police were notified. In interviews with the authorities, the defendants allegedly stated they were irritated at the victim because he was talking on a cellphone in another language. Surveillance videos capture the initial interaction between the defendants and victim as well as the assault.

The case is being prosecuted by Senior Assistant District Attorney Michael Boykin, of the District Attorney’s Green Zone Trial Bureau, with the assistance of Paralegal Angelika Rostkowska, also of the Green Zone, under the supervision of Assistant District Attorney David Klestzick, Bureau Chief.

"COLORADO SPRINGS, CO -- Saying the death of a deputy was my biggest fear, El Paso Co. Sheriff Bill Elder remembered his slain detective, Micah Flick, 34, and praised his deputies Tuesday. On my first day as sheriff, I was asked what my biggest fear was, and my biggest fear was losing a member of this family to tragedy in the line of duty. My heart is broken, for family and for the citizens of this county, Elder said. Flick was killed Monday, making him the third deputy in the state to be killed in recent days. Three other officers and one civilian were wounded in the shooting that was began when authorities were investigating an auto theft. The suspect, Manuel Zetina, 19, of Colorado Springs, died at the scene. Elder said Flick was well-known in the sheriffs office. Almost everybody in this agency knew him. He was a great father and a great friend to many... [Flick] grew up in this community, he attended Colorado Springs Christian schools, and he was well-respected. He did a great job at what he did, thats why he was a detective, Elder said. Flick celebrated his 11th anniversary with the department the day he was shot and killed. Flick is survived by his wife and 7-year-old twins. Other law enforcement agents injured in the shooting were: EPSO Detective Deputy Scott Stone, a five-year patrol veteran, was wounded by gunfire and was listed in stable condition at Memorial Hospital.

John Hickenlooper called the latest shooting a senseless act of violence. With the recent loss of now three deputies and many others injured, theres no denying the grave impact this sequence of shootings is having on our state, Hickenlooper said. We will once more come together to provide sympathy and strength for the deputys loved ones and pray for the recovery of those injured; however, we also must come together and say enough is enough. We want each officer, every deputy, to know we are grateful for their service. Eight officers in the U.S. have been killed in the line of duty since the start of the year.

"Muslim running for U.S. Senate praised the Founding Fathers. Then the insults began.

There werent a ton of people commenting on U.S. Senate hopeful Deedra Abbouds campaign Facebook page before Tuesday.

Then Abboud, a little-known candidate in Arizonas 2018 Democratic primary, posted a short tribute to the Founding Fathers, religious freedom and the separation of church and state - and the flood gates opened.

Sorry no room for Muslims in our government, wrote Chris Siemers.

Towel headed piece of [expletive], wrote Brian Zappa.

Abboud, a liberal 45-year-old attorney and first-time political candidate, might be a long shot in red-state Arizona. But the fact that Abboud, who converted to Islam in her 20s, also wears a visual marker of her faith - a headscarf - might also have just landed her unlikely campaign in the national spotlight.

Now, Im more on radar. More people know that Im out there, Abboud said in an interview Wednesday, noting a silver lining to the larger ugliness that she said the online attacks had exposed.

Originally from Little Rock, Ark., Abboud moved to Arizona as a young adult in the late 90s, and spent most of her career since then doing advocacy work, including as the founding director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) Arizona chapter, before attending law school and working as an immigration and estate law attorney.

Her campaigns Facebook page is filled with posts on her policy positions in favor of environmental protection, LGBTQ rights, health-care access and a higher minimum wage. But it wasnt until this week, amid the onslaught of xenophobic and racist insults that other people started to respond to her policy prescriptions as well. (Many of the negative commenters assumed that Abboud is a Middle Eastern immigrant, which she is not.)

Id have to say I agree, Desiree Miller wrote in response to a post about raising the minimum wage.

Do you really think that the corporation is going to willingly double their payroll without passing that cost on to the consumer? wrote Aaron Kuhne.

Running for political office as a Muslim in 2017 - when nonprofit watchdog groups are recording dramatic spikes in anti-Muslim rhetoric and harassment across the country - can seem fraught or exceedingly stressful.

President Donald Trump has painted Islam as a religion at odds with American values and Muslim immigrants as part of a potential Trojan horse plot aiming to attack or destroy the United States from within.

Such political rhetoric has fueled noticeable spikes in hate crimes, as well as hate incidents - typically verbal attacks like insults plastered on a Facebook page or hurled in the aisle of a grocery store that dont rise to the level of a crime - said Brian Levin, a criminologist and hate crimes expert at California State University at San Bernardino.

When political leaders are perceived to make intolerant statements with respect to Islam or pursue political policies that may appear intolerant, we see a correlation in hate crimes over the short term, Levin said.

The uptick in harassment has created a siege mentality in some Muslim communities, and particularly among recent immigrants, said Wael Alzayat, a former Obama administration official who is now the chief executive of Emgage, an organization that works to foster political participation and representation for American Muslims.

But paradoxically, Alzayat added, the attacks appear also to have spurred an increase in Muslim political participation, including in the form of candidates like Abboud, who says on her campaign website that the verbal attacks born of the 2016 presidential campaign spurred her to quit practicing law and return to advocacy work.

Theres an awakening here, said Alzayat, who has never met Abboud but says he will soon reach out to her. With what happened in the last campaign and the anti-Muslim rhetoric, I think a lot of the Muslims are looking at America and theyre thinking, Okay mom and dad, I know youre worried about Iraq, but our own backyard is burning. I think the community is under siege, and a lot of people are responding by getting engaged.

For Abboud, the first series of verbal attacks came in May, when a pair of right-wing militant groups, the Fraternal Order of Alt Knights and the Proud Boys, got word of a campaign event she had planned at a Phoenix restaurant and staged a protest outside. The armed demonstrators alarmed Abbouds campaign staffers and drew the attention of police.

Even after working for years as the director of two Muslim advocacy groups, Abboud appeared to bristle at the idea of having to spend time on the campaign trail defending Islam or her personal religious beliefs. And its unclear how she plans to manage such challenges.

If questions about my religion are relevant, then I will answer them, she said.

But the candidate said she also expected such attacks to continue, as she said she would for any minority candidate in todays America, and especially, perhaps for a Muslim woman like herself.

The silver lining, she suggested, is that the backlash might fuel some necessary reckoning.

This is part of what needs to happen in this country, she said. We need to have a conversation about what is an American and who gets to decide.

It was after midnight Tuesday when Abboud finally went to bed after the initial wave of Facebook comments, thrusting her for the first time into the national spotlight. And it was around 5 a.m. Wednesday when she was waked by her phone still pinging. By then, her campaign had gotten more attention than at any other point since she announced her candidacy in April.

Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, R - who Abboud would run against if they both win their respective primaries - had joined the debate too, defending her on Twitter. Hang in there @deedra2018. Sorry you have to put up with this. Lots of wonderful people across AZ. Youll find them, he wrote.

Scores of other people from Arizona and beyond had also jumped to Abbouds defense, urging her to ignore the haters, with some even pledging their votes.

Ignore the ignorance and hatred, Deedra. Arizona NEEDS you. You have my vote! wrote L.J. Roberts.

"OAK LAWN, IL -- Oak Lawn Fire Department Chief George Sheets retired on Tuesday. Sheets was the villages first African American fire chief and served in that capacity since 2009. He also assumed the responsibilities as chief for the Village of Chicago Ridge in 2014, under a model shared use intergovernmental agreement approved by the governing bodies of both communities. Sheets also reportedly retired last week from his position as fire chief for Chicago Ridge. Deputy Fire Chief Robert Tutko was appointed Oak Lawns acting fire chief during the village boards executive session following Tuesdays regular village board meeting. Tutkos appointment takes effect immediately. I thanked George for his service and wished him and his family the very best in his future endeavors, Deetjen said. Sheets began his firefighting career in Missouri in 1981. He spent the past two decades in fire chief positions in Michigan and Wisconsin. He was recognized as an organizational change manager and is one of only 600 firefighters throughout the country to earn the prestigious designation as a chief fire officer, according to his bio on the Village of Oak Lawn website. He presided over Oak Lawns fire department during periods of great volatility. Sheets said he had been contemplating retiring for the past year. After serving 36 years in the fire service with 22 of those years as a career fire chief, nine years with the Village of Oak Lawn, and four years serving concurrently as the shared fire chief in Chicago Ridge, reporting to twelve board members, two mayors and a village manager, it is time to move forward, Sheets said. To say that I have not been tremendously challenged, reporting to fifteen elected officials who have varying degrees of opinions, needs and wants, would be an understatement of the grandest kind. Sheets said he had no ill will toward Oak Lawns board of trustees but stated he and the village board had differences of opinions for how things were done. The route theyre going puts a wedge into good relations with the fire department, Sheets said. [Oak Lawns] is a fantastic fire department and organization, with a good bunch of firefighters who take care of the community. Yes, there were issues as there with any other fire department, but its how you address those issues. My approach was to sit down as a team to discuss it. I am totally at peace with my decision, he said. Image via Village of Oak Lawn",0

"SAN DIEGO (CNS) - A man was beaten up, kicked and smacked repeatedly with a bamboo stalk in a Logan Heights alley, and San Diego police Sunday described it as a hate crime.

Officers and paramedics responded shortly after 7:30 p.m. Saturday to the alley in the 2200 block of Imperial Avenue, where the victim was beaten in an apparent random attack, according to Officer Robert Heims.

The 56-year-old victim, an African American, was standing in the alley when a Latino suspect walked up, and in police said was an unprovoked act, began hitting him. The attacker knocked the victim to the ground, then kicked him several times.

While pummeling and kicking the man, the attacker used racial epithets to express his dislike of African-Americans, Heims said.

The suspect left the area, but returned a short time later.

The victim was still trying to recover when the suspect started hitting him again, Heims said. This time he was hitting him with a bamboo stick in the head and body.

The victim was hospitalized with several injuries, which were not considered to be life-threatening.

The suspect was described as a Hispanic man, 5 foot-5 inches to 5-foot, 8-inches tall, clean shaven, wearing a blue hat, blue t-shirt, blue shorts and low top shoes. He had two tattoos on both calves, possibly an S and D.

"Indiana Senate delays progress on hate crimes bill

“What’s really important is keeping in the back of your mind is how many people this really affects,” said Jason Wilkinson, Executive Director of LGBTQ Center of South Bend.

Talks of having a hate crimes law in Indiana are far from over. Just one day after Indiana lawmakers delayed voting on legislation targeting hate crimes local organizations are weighing in.

“We need to make sure that those laws are in place,” said Wilkinson.

The bill would allow judges to impose harsher sentences on someone for committing a crime due to race religion sexual orientation or gender identity.

“There are people who do unfortunately kill people based on the fact that they have a different skin color, or the fact that they are identified as either gay, lesbian, bi, trans, queer or questioning. So on that side it’s those things that we want to make sure that there are those protections in place,” said Wilkinson.

Currently, Indiana is one of five states without a hate crime, or bias crimes law in place.

It’s something that South Bend mom Patricia Forrest can’t wrap her head around since losing her son, Jodie Henderson.

Prosecutors say Jodie was murdered because he was gay.

“It’s been two years… that I laid my son to rest. It’s not easy but I’m getting through and getting by. You know I can’t bring my son back but the one who killed my son and whoever was involved should have been charged for a hate crime. That wasn’t enough for us but I had to deal with it,” said Patricia Forrest, Jodi Henderson’s mother.

But Wilkinson has been following the progress of the potential future law and says even more can be done.

“Just allowing the judge to make that decision on his own isn’t enough.” BUTT: “to give the judges the power that ‘no, if they prove it’s a hate crime, you can add this much more time to their sentence,” said Wilkinson.

“I believe a ‘hate crime bill’ should be passed because we need it,” said Forrest.

Organizers along with Jodie Henderson’s mother say they’ll continue to follow the details and progress in this potential law to push for protections. More information on that bill can be found here.",1

"Members of the Portsmouth Fire Department often spend as much time out on the water saving lives as they do in the towns neighborhoods. On Tuesday, for example, crews responded to three marine incidents, including one involving a juvenile alone on a sailboat adrift in the waters off Common Fence Point. According to Portsmouth Fire Department Dep. Chief Michael P. OBrien, crews were just finishing an earlier incident when the department got a report of a sailboat adrift with a juvenile on board alone. Members of the Bristol and Portsmouth Fire Departments along with the U.S. Coast Guard responded at around 3:28 p.m. and located the boat about 10 minutes later. The child was rescued and the boat was towed back to the shore. That incident occurred just after the department was notified that there was an inflatable raft adrift off Sand Point on Prudence Island. Concerned that a boater might have fallen out of the boat, Bristol, Portsmouth and Coast Guard responders began a search along the shore at around 2:58 p.m. in an effort to identify the owner. Eventually, they learned that the boat had been picked up by a commercial vessel. Ultimately, the boat owner was found and confirmed that it had blown away in the wind. People are asked to report situations where vessels have drifted away to local authorities or Coast Guard, as boats adrift in the bay are perceived as a sign of someone in distress and emergency responders must respond out to investigate, OBrien said. These responders are no longer available for any true emergency that may occur. Then, at around 3:52 p.m., Portsmouth Fire Dept. Lt. Lt. Mike Pinksaw saw a person in a small dinghy holding onto a mooring apparently in distress in the Sakonnet River, north of the Sakonnet River Bridge. Portsmouths Marine 2 diverted to that location and was able to help that individual. All units were cleared by 4:33 p.m. An engine company from Naval Station Newport covered Portsmouth during the water incidents.",0

"A Howard County grand jury has indicted the four Glenelg High School students charged with hate crimes after swastikas and racial epithets were found scrawled on the school’s property in late May, the state’s attorney’s office said Friday.

Tyler Curtiss of Brookeville, Matthew Lipp of Woodbine, Joshua Shaffer of Mount Airy and Seth Taylor of Glenwood — all 18 — each face identical seven-count indictments, including three hate-crime charges.

The four were released on their own recognizance and were ordered not to leave the state without a judge’s permission.

In the wake of the indictments, which were issued Wednesday, District Court trials scheduled following their arrests in May have been called off, according to court records, and the four are to appear in Circuit Court next month.

Attorneys for two of the teens declined comment Friday. A lawyer for another could not be reached, and no attorney information was listed in online records for the fourth teen.

On May 24, swastikas and racial epithets, including one that Howard County police said targeted the school’s African-American principal, were found painted on school campus sidewalks, outside walls and the parking lot. Community, religious, school and political leaders immediately denounced the vandalism and called for unity.

The four each face three counts related to race or religious harassment, two destruction of property-related charges and two trespassing charges, according to court records and a state’s attorney indictment summary released Friday. All of the charges are misdemeanors.

The graffiti was discovered before a morning awards ceremony for Glenelg graduating seniors.

Police said they used images from surveillance cameras to help identify the four suspects. Neither the police nor school system would confirm if they were members of the graduating senior class.

It was the second incident of its kind at the school in two years. According to State Police “hate or bias” reports, graffiti depicting swastikas and an anti-African American racial slur were discovered inside one of the school’s bathrooms in March 2017. No suspects had been identified at the time of the report last year.

"ATLANTA, GA — Traffic in midtown Atlanta remained shut down Saturday morning, after a scaffolding collapsed, causing an explosion at a high-rise apartment building on Friday. The collapse happened on a building at the corner of 14th and West Peachtree streets. Two window washers were on the scaffolding when it collapsed, but they were amazingly able to crawl to safety with the help of residents of the skyscraper. Authorities say that safety harnesses the window washers were wearing probably saved their lives. (For more news like this, find your local Patch here.

"Image copyright PA Image caption The Football Act was introduced as part of efforts to rid Scottish football of its long-running sectarianism problem, but was repealed in March

New laws to tackle offensive behaviour at Scottish football matches are not needed, a senior judge has concluded.

Lord Bracadale said football hate crime could effectively be dealt with using existing laws - for example breach of the peace.

The Scottish governments controversial Football Act was repealed by opposition MSPs at Holyrood earlier this year.

At the time, the government criticised its opponents for not proposing anything to replace it.

But Lord Bracadale, who was commissioned by the Scottish government last year to examine the countrys hate crime laws, said no new legislation was required to specifically cover football matches.

His report also says the countrys hate crime legislation should be expanded to cover offences aggravated by somebodys gender or age.

And he says all of Scottish hate crime laws should be consolidated into a single piece of legislation.

What does the report say about football?

Lord Bracadale says someone singing or shouting racist words at a football match could be charged with a racially aggravated breach of the peace, or behaving in a threatening or abusive manner.

He added: Thus, hate crime offences committed in the context of a regulated football match held in Scotland could be prosecuted in Scotland under pre-existing criminal law.

This would extend to behaviour occurring outside the football ground or on a journey to or from a match.

Opposition MSPs united at Holyrood to repeal the Football Act in March, arguing that it was unworkable, unnecessary and treated football fans as second class citizens.

The Scottish government argued that scrapping the legislation would send out the message that parliament was happy to allow toxic behaviour at matches to go unchecked and unchallenged.

And it said the act should be strengthened and improved rather than repealed.

What are the other key recommendations?

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Hostility based on gender or age would become specific aggravations

Lord Bracadale says new age and gender aggravations should be introduced in addition to the existing hate crime laws, which currently cover race, religion, disability, sexual orientation and transgender identity.

He also says it should be an offence to stir up hatred by encouraging others to hate people who have one of the protected characteristics.

Current law only deals with the stirring up of racial hatred, but Lord Bracadale says it should be extended to apply to all of the protected groups.

However, he stressed that the legal provisions should include measures that protect freedom of expression.

What are aggravated offences?

Hate crime aggravations apply when someone is convicted of an offence, such as assault or breach of the peace, which involves hostility based on one of the protected characteristics.

This can include words uttered in the heat of the moment while the offence is being committed, for example using a racial or religious expletive while assaulting someone.

The aggravations are not specific offences, but are used to flag up the hate aspect of a crime - which the judge can take into account when passing sentence.

What else does his report say?

Image caption Lord Bracadale was asked by the Scottish government to examine the countrys hate crime laws

Lord Bracadale makes a total of 22 recommendations, which also include:

A suggestion that courts could be allowed to recognise offences that involve the exploitation of vulnerable people - for example fraud offences against elderly or disabled people

Intersex should be made a separate characteristic from transgender identity, and consideration should be given to removing outdated terms from the definition of transgender

No new legislation is needed to tackle online hate crime as existing laws are sufficient

How big a problem is hate crime in Scotland?

Image copyright Getty Images

There were a total of 5,708 hate crime charges in Scotland in 2016-17, including 3,349 racial, 673 religious, 1,075 LGB, 40 transgender and 188 disability hate crimes.

It is widely accepted that the real level of hate crime is far higher than reported in official statistics, as a significant number go unreported.

Police have also warned that many recorded instances of hate crime have an online element as increasing numbers of youngsters use social media to bully their peers or hide behind fake online accounts.

The Scottish government has stressed that Scotland is an open and inclusive nation but is not immune from the threat of racism, intolerance and prejudice.

What has the Scottish government said?

Community Safety Minister Annabelle Ewing said she agreed that Scotlands hate crime laws should be consolidated into a single piece of legislation.

And she said the Scottish government would use the report as a basis for wider consultation with communities and groups across the country on how to bring forward new legislation that is fit for the 21st century.

She added: We have been consistently clear that legislation alone will not achieve the inclusive and equal society that we aspire to, however the laws passed by parliament do form a clear basis for what is and is not acceptable in the communities we are elected to serve.

What other reaction has there been?

Both Scottish Labour and the Scottish Liberal Democrats said the judges conclusion that specific laws around football were not needed was an embarrassment for the government.

Human rights group Amnesty International welcomed the clarity and consistency the recommendations would bring to hate crime laws, and urged ministers to act on them.

And the Scottish Greens welcomed the recommendations around age hostility, which the party said would help to to end discrimination and negative stereotypes towards both young and old people.",1

"A surgeon has been stabbed on his way to a mosque by attackers who shouted “abusive” comments, according to a Muslim community leader.

The victim, a 58-year-old man named locally as surgeon Dr Nasser Kurdy, was taken to hospital with a stab wound to his neck following the assault outside the Altrincham Islamic Centre, in Grove Lane, in the Greater Manchester market town on Sunday evening.

He has been discharged from hospital, according to his colleague Dr Khalid Anis, a spokesman for the Altrincham & Hale Muslim Association, who said he was “very lucky”.

Greater Manchester Police said two man, aged 32 and 54, were arrested within an hour of the attack, which the force is treating as a hate crime but not terrorism related.

Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson said: “‘This is a very nasty and unprovoked attack against a much-loved local man.”

Police are not looking for any other suspects, he added.

Dr Anis, who was with his friend moments after the attack, said: “It could have been very, very serious. He said he noticed someone cross the road and then somebody just attacked him from behind.

“There were definitely abusive comments made – obviously he was in shock at the time, he had just been stabbed so the detail of those comments I don’t know but there were definitely abusive comments made by the attackers at the door of the mosque.

“We understand it was a knife – he is very lucky. It’s obviously out of the blue, it’s shocked the whole community.

“It’s not just a criminal act against the Muslim community or one individual, it’s the people living in Altrincham, I think we all feel that.

“The fact they attacked an orthopaedic consultant who devoted his life to helping others is really quite poignant.”

Other Muslim leaders condemned the attack.

"CSI Panel Discusses Policy Dealing With Hate Crimes

By: Haziq Naeem

Hate crimes in certain American cities have spiked twenty percent last year. With most of that rise attributed to the divisive and inflammatory rhetoric used in the recent election cycle, hate crimes across college campuses have also increased.

The definition of a hate crime is one that target someone’s identity.

In New York, an individual’s identity falls under protected classes for purposes of the law, and according to Section 485.05 of New York State Penal Law the protected classes are “race, color, national origin, ancestry, gender, religion, religious practice, age, disability or sexual orientation.”

On October 17, an event designed to raise awareness about what constitutes a hate crime and why they occur was held from 2:30pm to 4:00pm in the Williamson Theater.

The panelists were Professor Jay Arena, Professor Mayra Humphreys, a representative from the NYPD hate crimes unit and Mark Palladino from Richmond County District Attorney’s Office.

According to the captain from the NYPD hate crimes unit, in order for someone to be prosecuted for a hate crime, there are three important components that they look for: intent, imminence and plausibility.

If someone is yelling hateful slurs or targeting an aspect of your identity, it is not considered a hate crime. It must be a threat, and in order to be considered a threat it must contain all three previously listed components.

Essentially, if hate speech is followed by a plausible, imminent and true threat, it is a criminal offense.

Mark Palladino, Chief Prosecutor of hate crimes on Staten Island, explained his policy dealing with hate crime offenses.

His policy states that the status of hate crimes will always be elevated. For example, an assault is considered a misdemeanor, however, if that same assault is motivated due to the victim’s identity, hence constituting a hate crime, then that misdemeanor is upgraded to a felony.

Mr. Palladino does not subject hate crimes to plea bargains.

Plea bargains are an agreement between the defendant and prosecutor where the defendant is given the opportunity to confess and in return is offered a lessened sentence or another concession.

Meaning, the accused must either confess and face the full penalty or face prosecution.

An important distinction between a hate crime and one that is not considered as such is that the crime must be initiated due to the victim’s identity. If the crime was initiated due to some other reason, but slurs targeting another’s identity were used during the act of the crime, it is not considered a hate crime.

Professor Mayra Humphreys and Jay Arena talked about the socioeconomic reasons for why hate crimes occur.

“Implicit biases are stereotypical thoughts and feelings, these are involuntary and we consciously reject them when we notice them in punctuated ways,” Professor Mayra Humphreys said.

Millions of people hold implicit biases about people different than themselves, and these are harder to root out since they do not reside in the conscious parts of our mind.

An example of implicit bias is getting uneasy or nervous when seeing a Muslim at an airport or African American on the street.

To challenge these biases created by our mind, three methods were suggested.

The first was that we question the stereotypes that arise and replace them instead with a positive view of the group.

The second is to practice perspective by taking and learning from what other people tell you about themselves rather than continuing to believe the pre-conceived stereotypical notions you have.

Lastly, increasing opportunity for contact with individuals from different groups challenges the brains assumptions of those groups.

“To understand hate crimes on campus we must look at broader society,” Professor Jay Arena said.

According to FBI statistics, over half of hate crimes committed are racially motivated.

Racism depends on a structure to survive, and according to Professor Jay Arena, “we still have deep institutionalized racism in our society.”

The panel raised the notion that in order to reduce the number of hate crimes committed, we must tackle the institutional problems that give rise to hate.",1
"Boston officials are questioning whether a lapse in fire escape inspections along Beacon Street in Boston may have contributed to a massive Back Bay fire in March that resulted in the death of two Boston firefighters. The last inspection of the fire escape at 296 Beacon St., the location of the nine-alarm fire that killed Lt. Ed Walsh and Firefighter Michael Kennedy in late March, was conducted in 2004, according to MyFoxBoston.

Castlin was working at the Wingate Inn at 560 Greers Chapel Dr. in Kennesaw on the evening of Dec. 7 when he was accosted by two robbers, who shot and killed him during the course of the robbery.

"MIAMI BEACH, FL — A construction worker died on Friday afternoon after falling from a Miami Beach construction site. Earlier in the day, a highway inspector died when he fell from an overpass on the Palmetto Expressway. The Miami Beach incident occurred at 35 Street and Collins Avenue.

"The world has not stopped providing a steady stream of harrowing storylines for Law & Order: SVU, which concludes its 18th season this week. Among recent ripped-from-the-headlines topics: powerful political figures and media chiefs accused of sexual misconduct, rape in the military and violent aggression toward transgender people. “I often think about how they’re going to keep coming up with these stories, and then you get a season like this,” says Raúl Esparza (above, right), who has played ADA Rafael Barba since 2012.

The two-part finale (both installments air tonight) interconnects a pair of hot-button issues: hate crimes against Muslims and the consequences that arise after an undocumented witness is threatened with deportation. “The episode opens with three men who commit rape and murder while robbing a family-run Syrian restaurant in New York City,” says Esparza. “The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement gets involved when an illegal immigrant is a possible witness to the case. Barba has to deal with the fact that he’s losing a witness and figure out how to get him back to New York, despite the fact that he’s a criminal himself.”

Law & Order: SVU Celebrates 18 Years and 400 Episodes NBC’s heart-racing investigation drama marks a major milestone. Plus: A look at what’s on the horizon and how the cop tale has evolved over two newsworthy decades

Everyone wants the crimes solved, but getting there might take some improvisation. “The question is how far Barba is willing to push Lieutenant Benson [Mariska Hargitay] to possibly leave information out regarding certain witnesses. Is it justice when you achieve the right end but the means aren’t great? Barba is a good man. I love when we get put in those quandaries,” Esparza emphasizes. “It’s especially fun to work that stuff out with Mariska—we always leave those kinds of scenes with a real high.”

Esparza says fans will respond to these mano-a-mano bouts: “Barba and Benson are hurtling into these messy issues, and they occasionally find themselves on opposite sides. That friction makes for very good television.”

"Citing three people with knowledge of Woodwards links to the group, including a former member of the Atomwaffen Division, ProPublica reported that Woodward had joined the group in 2016 and attended a three-day training camp that included training in firearms, hand-to-hand combat, and survival skills.

ProPublica reported Thursday that Woodward was an active member of a group called the Atomwaffen Division, a violent white supremacist group that advocates for overthrowing the US government.

Carrie Braun, spokesperson for the Orange County Sheriffs Department, told BuzzFeed News that investigators have been looking into Woodwards possible ties to white supremacist groups, as well as other motives that could determine whether Bernsteins killing was a hate crime.

Investigators have yet to determine a motive for the killing, which officials are looking into as a possible hate crime.

Three days later, the Orange County Sheriffs Department arrested Samuel Woodward on suspicion of murdering Bernstein, a former classmate of his at the Orange County School of the Arts.

Blaze Bernstein, a 19-year-old University of Pennsylvania student, went missing early this month while visiting his family in Southern California. After his body was found on Jan. 9, authorities discovered he had been stabbed more than 20 times before being left buried in a shallow grave.

Investigators are looking into whether a 20-year-old man, accused of killing an openly gay and Jewish former classmate, has any ties to white supremacist groups, and whether those links may have played a role in the grisly killing, officials told BuzzFeed News.

Braun told BuzzFeed News she could not confirm if investigators had confirmed whether Woodward had ties to any particular group.

Investigators with both the sheriffs department and the Orange County District Attorneys office are still investigating the case, she said, and are looking at the possibility of multiple motives to the killing.

A search warrant affidavit obtained by the Orange County Register revealed the two young men had met up on Jan. 2. According to the documents, Woodward told investigators that he picked up Bernstein in the parking lot of a Hobby Lobby and, from there, the two drove to Borrego Park, where Bernstein set out walking alone.

According to the Register, Woodward told investigators he waited for an hour before leaving, but Bernstein did not return to the car; Woodward then left to meet a girlfriend.

The affidavit noted that Woodward appeared to have cuts and bruises, which he said were from a fight club. When asked about dirt under his fingernails, Woodward said hed fallen into a dirt puddle during a sparring session.

The affidavit revealed that the two men had also been in contact before the meeting and that Bernstein had told friends, via social media and texts, that he was planning to pursue Woodward sexually because he believed Woodward was about to hit on me and made me promise not to tell anyone..but I have texted everyone, uh oh.

Woodward also told investigators Bernstein had kissed him and that he wanted to tell Blaze to get off him, according to the Register.

Woodwards ties to Atomwaffen Division — a three-year old neo-Nazi group known to have multiple scattered cells across the country — has added another layer to the homicide case.

According to the Anti-Defamation League, which monitors extremist groups, members of Atomwaffen Division often refer to a race war and make frequent references to Adolf Hitler and Charles Manson, who believed his killings in the late 1960s would spark a race war in the US.

Though the group considered to be small and relatively young, the organization has already been tied to several acts of violence throughout the country.

In May, one of the groups founders, Devon Arthurs, was charged in Florida with murdering two of his roommates, who were also members of the neo-Nazi group. According to the Miami Herald, Arthurs told investigators that the killings occurred because he had converted to Islam and his roommates had taunted him about his faith.

Arthurs also told authorities that another roommate, Brandon Russell, another self-described neo-Nazi and member of Atomwaffen, had plans to blow up power lines and detonate explosives in a nuclear power plant.

Russell has pleaded guilty to charges of possessing explosives and bomb-making materials in his Tampa Palms apartment.

In December, 17-year-old Nicholas Giampa shot himself in Virginia after shooting and killing Buckley Kuhn-Fricker and her husband Scott Fricker — parents of his former girlfriend who had urged her to break up with him because of his white supremacist views.

The Huffington Post reported the 17-year-old was a fan and former member of the Atomwaffen group, and ProPublica reported the teenager had been in contact with members of the organization, according to another former member.

According to the Anti-Defamation League, Atomwaffen Division activity has been reported in Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Texas, Massachusetts, Washington, and Wisconsin.",1

"The city of Portland, Oregon, is still trying to recover from two deaths related to a possible hate crime, so the mayor wants to put a stop to two upcoming demonstrations that he describes as “alt-right.”

On Monday, Mayor Ted Wheeler asked the federal government to revoke the permit for a rally set for Sunday as well as for one set for June 10. The two rallies are planned by different organizers and will take place on federal land, which makes it a federal government issue.

“Our city is in mourning, our community’s anger is real, and the timing and subject of these events can only exacerbate an already difficult situation,” Wheeler posted on Facebook.

— White Supremacist mob of protesters gather in Virginia with torches —

According to a statement, Wheeler had already said that the city would not grant permits, but the federal government had already granted one for the June 4 rally.

“My main concern is that they are coming to peddle a message of hatred and of bigotry,” Wheeler said. “They have a First Amendment right to speak, but my pushback on that is that hate speech is not protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.”

Two men were stabbed to death and a third was badly injured during an attack on a commuter train on Friday. The men were reportedly trying to stop a man who was shouting anti-Muslim slurs at two young woman, one of whom was wearing a hijab. The attack took place just hours before the holy month of Ramadan.",1
"A Tennessee man has been arrested and charged with assaulting a gay man in Murfreesboro, reports the Murfreesboro Daily News Journal.

Brandon Wiley, 24, of Lewisburg, has been charged with aggravated assault with a hate crime enhancement in the case. If found guilty, he could potentially face additional penalties or time in jail as a result.

Police say they responded to the parking lot in front of a local bar in Murfreesboro around 3:30 a.m. on Tuesday. There, they found a man, severely beaten, laying on the ground.

The 39-year-old victim suffered multiple severe facial injuries, including a broken nose and fractured orbital sockets. He was transported to a local hospital and treated for his injuries.

A security guard for the building told police that he saw the attack while driving past the area on patrol. After seeing Wiley punch the injured man, the security guard said Wiley approached his car and told him the man had “grabbed his junk and molested him.”

The victim later told police that Wiley beat him up because he “propositioned” him.

Police say that Wiley allegedly “sent out several photos of himself covered in blood and was bragging about beating up a gay man for ‘grabbing’ his penis.”

Police say Wiley admitted to striking the victim, but video of the incident, as well as documented “earlier activities between Mr. Wiley and the victim” were inconsistent with his statement.

Wiley has been released on bond and is due back in Rutherford County General Sessions court on Aug. 28.

Tennessee does not have any law explicitly preventing juries or judges from taking “gay panic” or “trans panic” — the idea that the victim’s sexual orientation or gender identity was so upsetting that it made the perpetrator of an assault fear for their safety — into account when considering whether a defendant’s physically violent response may have been provoked or justified.

"All five strands of hate crime - race, religion, sexual orientation, disability and transgender identity have risen since 2011.

A hate crime is any offence perceived to be motivated by hostility or prejudice, according to the Crown Prosecution Service.

The number of hate crimes against Britons of ethnic or religious minorities soared around the time the UK voted to quit the European Union and in the aftermath of recent attacks, according to a government report.

The Home Office said on Tuesday the 29 percent rise in a year marked the biggest annual jump in hate crimes since figures were first recorded in 2011. Between 2015 and 2016, there were 62,518 reported offences. The following year, that number rose to 80,393.

There was a genuine rise in hate crime around the time of the EU referendum, the report said, referring to the Brexit referendum.

Religious or racially aggravated offences rose in the months leading up to the vote, from about 3,500 recorded incidents in April 2016 to more than 5,000 in June of the same year, when the decision to leave the EU was announced. In June 2017, reported hate crimes peaked at 6,000.

The Home Office said figures rose in the wake of the Westminster Bridge, Manchester Arena and London Bridge attacks, which took place in March, May, and June of this year respectively, together claiming more than 30 lives.

Hate crimes and Islamophobia tend to rise after violence where suspects are said to be Muslim, with followers of the Islamic faith suffering collective punishment.

Muslim women targeted

Muslim women suffer disproportionately, said Ragad Altikriti, a senior member of the Muslim Association of Britain.

Statistics have proven that hate crimes against Muslims increase significantly around terrorist attacks, she told Al Jazeera.

[And] Brexit was considered to many as a signal that refugees are not welcomed … [so] there was an increase in hate crimes including the Muslim community, especially women who are visibly Muslims. The headscarf was conflated with being foreign and not welcomed.

Zainab Mir, 21, became a victim earlier this year.

{articleGUID}

I was travelling on the Tube when a lady stood up and pointed at me. She shouted youre the reason this country is terrorised, Mir told Al Jazeera. It was a very busy train, but only the guy next to me asked If I was OK. Nobody else said anything.

Despite reporting the incident, police told Mir there was no CCTV footage, and they were unable to pursue the case. The experience has made her feel uneasy, she said.

I didnt feel very safe afterwards; I always made sure I was with someone and didnt go anywhere I didnt need to. Even now Im still more aware of people around me because I dont want it to happen again. Im definitely more vigilant, she said.

Some 30 percent of religiously motivated offences in the last year involved violence against the victim, the Home Office said.

An attack on Londons Finsbury Park Mosque on June 19, in which a van driver targeted Muslims, left one dead and 11 injured.

There are criminals and attackers on every side, Altikriti told Al Jazeera. Muslims were able to say we can be victims too, and it forced those in power to think about the countrys Muslim population and consider how the rise in hate crime has affected them.

{articleGUID}

The UK is home to 2.8 million Muslims.

Samina Ansari, 37, has been attacked three separate times over the past 10 years.

From being attacked in her car at a red light by two white men with a pitbull [dog] on a metal lead almost nine years ago, to having ISIS shouted at her and her nine-year-old son on a street in Glasgow last week, Ansari said she suffers from long-term effects.

You end up reliving each one of the incidents and that experience. I have felt quite violated, and at points, it took a toll on my mental well-being, she told Al Jazeera.

Political events such as the EU referendum and the election of US President Donald Trump, who is seen as an Islamophobe, have had an effect, Ansari said.

Hate crime has always been there, but its almost like the state of our politics, following the Brexit vote and election of Trump, have given people a license to become more vicious in their attacks, she said. Muslim women seem to be the primary target.",1

"A white woman and her black boyfriend were targeted by two idiots Brooklyn, N.Y., men who are accused of shouting racial slurs and threatening to “lynch” the boyfriend before viciously beating him, according to court papers.

The New York Post reports that the woman and her boyfriend were walking together over the weekend when 25-year-old Bernard Szurant and 27-year-old Rudolph Evmeneko attacked them around 5:40 a.m. Saturday.

“This is our neighborhood, you fucking nigger! Get out of here!” the duo shouted, threatening to “crack” the man’s skull open, according to the report. “We’re going to lynch you, you fucking charcoal burner!”

The duo then jumped the boyfriend, repeatedly punching him in the head, according to the report. The man had to be treated for bruising and swelling on his face, as well as a contusion on his arm from when he tried to defend himself.

“I feel like I’m back 50 years ago or something,” the woman, who was identified as only “Anna,” told the New York Daily News.

“Being attacked for [our races]—it’s the first time,” she added. “I’ve never felt any hate from people that live here.”

Anna told the Daily News that she and her boyfriend, identified only as “John,” were planning to celebrate their sixth anniversary when they ran into their assailants.

“They were basically torturing [John],” she said. “They couldn’t hit him because he’s tall and they were smaller, [but] they literally attached to his body and wouldn’t let go. Like leeches.”

John said he was more concerned about his girlfriend’s safety and ensuring that the men couldn’t get to her.

“They said something about ‘I want to lynch your ass,’ or something like that. They know enough about black history to know that, apparently,” John added.

“A couple times they feigned that they had a weapon, acted like they had a gun, and that was a bit unnerving,” John said. “I said to him, ‘You’re not a man if you can’t use your hands.’”

The Daily News reports that Anna tried to call 911, but Evmenenko knocked the cellphone out of her hand before resuming beating up on John.

“This was going on all the way until the cops literally pulled up in the car and they grabbed them off of him,” Anna said. “[John] didn’t want to cause serious injuries. ... He was a professional boxer years ago. He knows how to protect himself from hits.”

As police took both men into custody, Szurant continued to struggle, even threatening the black NYPD detective who was detaining him.

“I know you,” Szurant said, according to authorities. “I know where you work. I am going to come to the 61st Precinct and fucking kill you, you fucking nigger.”

Both Szurant and Evmenenko are facing charges of assault, menacing, criminal mischief and harassment. (What does it take to get a hate crime up in there? Asking for a friend.) Szurant is also facing additional charges of harassment for threatening the detective.

Despite all of that, the violent pair were released from jail following a brief arraignment Sunday, although they were ordered to stay away from Anna and John.

"Washington, D.C. (Sept. 9, 2017) — Leaders from # civil rights, faith based, human rights, and community organizations condemn today’s bigoted, anti-Muslim online campaign by ACT for America, reportedly the nation’s largest anti-Muslim hate group. This online campaign was scheduled for just two days before the anniversary of September 11 to target and manufacture hatred for American Muslims at a time when violence against Muslim, Arab, South Asian, and Sikh communities is reaching historic highs.

ACT originally planned to coordinate 67 anti-Muslim rallies across 36 states under the theme “America First.” However, after thousands of Americans came out in peaceful resistance to white supremacy and racism in Charlottesville and Boston, ACT decided to call off its rallies and shift to today’s online campaign, a clear signal that messages of justice and solidarity are drowning out messages of hate nationwide.

This is not the first time civil rights groups and anti-racist protestors stared down ACT’s bigotry. In June ACT held anti-Muslim rallies in 30 cities across the nation under the theme “March Against Shariah”. This campaign was met with strong resistance from civil rights groups who held alternative events that telegraphed calls for love, fairness, and justice. The Trump administration was silent in response.

ACT’s founder, Brigitte Gabriel, has made her racism clear. She has said, “Every practicing Muslim is a radical Muslim” and has argued, outrageously, that Muslims are a “natural threat to civilized people of the world, particularly Western society.” In a video message launching the America First rallies, Ms. Gabriel exclaims, “Let’s show our president that we are behind him in securing our nation.” In accordance with the bigotry that ACT promotes, its previous anti-Muslim rallies have attracted a host of armed militia-type groups and white nationalists.

Likewise, President Trump has made no secret of his bigotry, stating on the record, “I think Islam hates us” and moving forward with his administration’s dogged pursuit of a “Muslim Ban,” among other policies. The words and actions of the administration, including high-level advisors who are known standard-bearers for white supremacist movements, as well as the President himself, increasingly fuel and validate violence targeting Muslims and people perceived as Muslim. The FBI’s 2015 hate crimes statistics, the most updated data available, show a 67% increase in hate crimes against Muslims in 2015, while violence aimed at South Asian, Sikh, and Arab communities continue to rise. The xenophobic statements by the President and Gabriel run counter to the values of justice and inclusivity that we seek to uphold.

Peaceful resistance by civil rights groups, immigrant and faith communities, and communities of color has been the strongest counterweight to the insults and injuries of white supremacists and this administration. We demand this administration, and all elected and appointed officials, condemn groups that peddle hate in the strongest possible terms, and back that condemnation with swift action and policies that contribute to the transformation of our institutions. The hatred must stop now. As a coalition of diverse organizations representing communities of color and immigrants at the national, state, and local levels, we are committed to condemning bigotry of all kinds and advancing the principles of racial justice.",1
"Black people have been behind a number of would-be hate crimes against other Black people. But the hoaxes, often intended to shine a light on racism against Black folks, backfire many times and are harmful.

The deceptive act–which cannot be condoned–created an opportunity to address bigotry. Discovery of the epithet moved academy superintendent Lt. Gen. Jay Silveria to warn the cadets, faculty and staff that intolerance at the academy is unacceptable.

There are several reasons that Black people falsify hate crimes, including psychological illness, attention seeking or rallying support for a cause, Phyllis Gerstenfeld, a criminal justice professor at the California State University Santislaus, told the Christian Science Monitor, referring to these types of case in general.

What’s missing from the list is the element of poor judgment. There are far better ways of calling attention to racism. It’s counterproductive once the truth is discovered, and it creates doubt when a genuine hate crime is committed. At the same time, these hoaxes discourage actual victims from reporting racist attacks.

That kind of misguided thinking was involved in a 2015 case at Kean University in New Jersey. Police arrested an alumna who tweeted threats against Black students. The investigation found Kayla-Simone McKelvey, an activist, paused during a protest to create an anonymous Twitter account and post the messages. Her motive was to create awareness about campus racism.

At St. Olaf College In Minnesota, a faked hate crime brought a measure of good to the campus, which was outweighed by the harm.

Students rallied against bigotry after reports that a threatening message was placed on the windshield of a Black student. Some students said the ruse didn’t change the reality of racism and welcomed the new awareness, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported.

It also gave ammunition to folks who are less empathetic about discrimination, and it no doubt gave real victims pause about filing a report.",1

In the last week of fall semester, a racial epithet used to disparage African-Americans was found spelled out in the snow behind New residence hall in the early morning of Dec. 14, 2017.

After being reported to Campus Safety, the epithet was photographed as evidence and then destroyed. Within hours, Dean Debbie Nolan sent out a campus-wide email to inform the community of the incident and to ask for support in the subsequent investigation carried out by Student Affairs and Campus Safety.

In a follow-up email sent out to the community on Jan. 12, Dean Nolan confirmed that a student “came forward and took full responsibility for the action,” adding that “following official college policy” the student “was adjudicated and received disciplinary sanctions.”

According to the Student Handbook, violations of student conduct policy are addressed in either an administrative hearing or a private hearing held by the student conduct panel. The panel consists of two students and three faculty members chosen by the student government and faculty election, respectively.

“There are no administrators — the student conduct panel represents diversity across race, gender and department and is elected by the campus community,” Dean Nolan said.

The five members of the student conduct panel review the case, determine for which violations the student will be held responsible, and then deliberate disciplinary sanctions in a private setting, Dean Nolan explained.

In a recent interview, Dean Nolan acknowledged a “heartwarming response of outrage and support” from the campus community in the wake of the bias incident. However, many students and faculty members expressed confusion and concern over the usage of the term “bias incident” to describe what had happened.

Said Mya Flood ’18, “It should have been specified that [the incident] was racially-charged to alert the people of color on campus of concerns of their safety in the community.”

“[The N-word] has a hurtful history,” said Oriah Lopez ‘18. “It shows a blatant choice to be hateful.”

In a public reply to Dean Nolan’s email, visiting assistant professor of African dance Jeannine Osayande questioned whether “the incident is considered ‘bias’ or racist?”

According to Teaching Tolerance, a project developed by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a bias incident is “conduct, speech or expression motivated by bias or prejudice. It differs from a hate crime in that no criminal activity is involved.” The difference between a bias incident and a hate crime is whether or not the activity was accompanied by a criminal offense.

“While hate crimes, if charged and prosecuted, will be dealt with in the court system, schools must handle bias incidents through grievance procedures and educational programs,” according to the project.

In Pennsylvania law, a hate crime is defined as “a criminal act motivated by ill will or hatred towards a victim’s race, color, religion or national origin,” according to the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission.

Dean Nolan explained that Ursinus looked to common practice across other campuses in addressing what is considered a bias incident.

President Brock Blomberg responded to additional criticism that the College was using vague, impassive language to protect its image.

“This is a racist act. It is not ok to be racist. When Debbie used ‘bias incident’ and ‘racial epithet,’ at the highest level it meant to say that this incident was racist,” he said. “Others questioned, ‘Are you minimizing this awful event?’ But ‘bias’ is used as a collective to accurately bracket prejudice against all groups. It is a challenge in communication — to make sure [this event] is recognized as a serious grievance. We think this incident is a racist act and stand opposed against these incidents.”

Simara Price Telesford, assistant professor of biology, asked Dean Nolan in another public email to “expand upon what the disciplinary sanctions are for these type of incidences.”

When Dean Nolan did not publicly respond to Telesford’s question via email it drew further concern from students.

“The fact that we don’t know how this person is going to be punished makes other people in the community think, ‘What happens if something happens to me?’ Without people knowing what repercussions were put in place, people might still just do whatever,” said Cameron Solomon ‘19.

However, the College is bound by federal law to respect the privacy of the student’s case, Dean Nolan explained in an interview. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 protects student educational records — including judicial records — from being made public.

The Clery Act of 1990 requires colleges to release publicly the final results of the student conduct process “in cases where the violation of a College policy is also determined to be a ‘crime of violence,’” according to the Student Handbook.

In this case, the College cannot disclose what disciplinary sanctions were given to the student because it was defined as bias incident, not a hate crime. However, “the range of penalties in these kinds of situations usually includes suspension or dismissal,” Dean Nolan said.

President Blomberg said he understands why members of the community are concerned.

“People want to make sure that we are serious, and people are held accountable.” he said. “Understand the student conduct policy. Have faith in the process, in the students and faculty elected onto these committees.”

Although there is not yet a section on how Ursinus defines and addresses bias incidents in the Student Handbook, the Diversity Committee is currently working on policy specific to addressing bias incidents and hate crimes, Dean Nolan said.

The new bias incident response policy is expected to be published before the start of the fall 2018 semester.

Dean Nolan is also proposing the assembly of a Bias Incident Response Team (BIRT) that would directly handle bias incidents, including support and communication to the community.

To a file a discrimination complaint based on religion, race, age, disability or sexual orientation, the Guide for Student Concerns suggests contacting the Dean’s Office, Campus Safety or Human Resources.

If you have questions specific to the bias incident that occurred last semester, please email Dean Nolan at dnolan@ursinus.edu.

GREENWOOD, Ind. – Police are investigating racial vandalism spray painted on property in two Greenwood neighborhoods.

On Sunday morning, homeowners woke up to find offensive words and symbols on their vehicles and garage door.

“It’s frustrating. I hate it,” said Suzanne Woehler, a vandalism victim.

Someone spray painted a swastika on Woehler’s garage door. Another neighbor had the words “Neo Nazi” plastered on the trunk of his car. An inappropriate image was left on a man’s work van.

“This is wrong. This is wrong,” said Mang Lien, a vandalism victim.

Vandals hit property in Barton Farms and the Greenwood Pines subdivisions. A neighbor’s security cameras captured the suspects around 4 o’clock Sunday morning. Footage shows a dark colored vehicle park and three suspects get out. Seconds later, the three suspects get back in the car and take off. Exactly what the suspects do while out of the car is done off camera. The suspects run in the direction of a home that was tagged. The footage is now evidence.

“It was humiliating for me. I don’t want people to think that about me because that’s not at all who I am. They have no right to portray that on me,” said Woehler.

Greenwood police believe the same group of vandals is responsible for all the offensive graffiti.

“We also have to wonder is this a hate crime or a crime that’s racially motivated,” said Matthew Fillenwarth, Assistant Chief with the Greenwood Police Department.

Detectives don’t know if the message behind the spray paint was hateful or if it was just mischief.

“It’s not funny. It’s not right. They have no right to go onto anyone’s property and deface anything; a car, a house, anything,” said Woehler.

Detectives believe the three or four suspects were seen in a dark colored vehicle, possibly a Chevy Cruz. If you recognize any of the suspects or the vehicle in the surveillance video, you’re asked to the Greenwood Police Department at 317-865-0300.",1

"WMAR, Facebook via CNN Richard Wilbur Collins III

WMAR, Facebook via CNN Richard Wilbur Collins III

(CNN) - Today should have been the day Richard Collins III walked across a stage in a cap and gown.

Instead, his gown lay draped over a chair in the front row at Bowie State Universitys commencement ceremony.

Collins was three days away from graduating when he was stabbed to death at a bus stop while visiting friends at the University of Maryland.

The FBI is investigating whether Collins was killed in a hate crime. Police said the suspect was a member of a Facebook group that spewed hatred toward minorities.

But what the suspect didnt know was that Collins had just been commissioned as a US Army lieutenant two days earlier. That he had served in the Reserve Officers Training Corps and planned to keep serving his country after graduation, his father told NBC News.

The young man would go out of his way, sometimes to my chagrin, to go and help others -- but you want to try to encourage that in your children, Richard Collins Jr. said.

But now, the parents worst nightmare has just reached my doorstep.

Celebration and mourning

Incidentally, Tuesdays Bowie State graduation ceremony took place on the University of Marylands campus.

As the Class of 2017 streamed in, their faces alternated from joyous to somber.

Collins relatives sat in the front row, near the gown he should have been wearing.

We gather this morning with heavy hearts, Bowie State University President Dr. Mickey L. Burnim said.

One of our graduates, in the prime of his life, has fallen victim to an unprovoked assault in yet one more manifestation of the senseless violence permeating our society.

The president called for a moment of silence and asked the graduates to contemplate what each of us might do to promote greater peace, harmony and love that seems to be so lacking in our country, in our world today.

Collins was later posthumously awarded his bachelors degree. His family accepted his diploma for him.

Bizarre commands end in stabbing

Around 3 a.m. Saturday, Collins and his friends were standing at a bus stop waiting for an Uber when suspect Sean Christopher Urbanski approached them, police said.

Witnesses reported Urbanski yelling bizarre commands at Collins, University of Maryland Police Chief David Mitchell said.

He said to the victim, Step left, step left if you know whats good for you, the witnesses said, according to the police chief.

The victim looked at him puzzled with the other friends of his and said No, Mitchell said. It was then that (the suspect) stabbed the victim in his chest.

Urbanski has been charged with first- and second-degree murder as well as first-degree assault. His attorney, William C. Brennan Jr., said at a bond hearing Monday that his client was intoxicated at the time.

But Maryland District Judge Patrice E. Lewis denied bond for Urbanski, calling him an absolute danger to the community.

Alt-Reich group now offline

The police chief said Urbanski was a member of the Alt-Reich Facebook group.

When I looked at the information thats contained on that website ... its despicable, Mitchell said.

It shows extreme bias against women, Latinos, members of the Jewish faith and especially African-Americans, which brings up questions as to the motive of this case.

The Facebook page has since been taken offline.

The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate crimes and hate groups, said it had not heard of Alt-Reich before the Maryland killing.

In recent months, there has been a jump in racist groups naming themselves variations of the term alt-right, said Heidi Beirich, director of the SPLCs Intelligence Project.

Maryland State Attorney Angela D. Alsobrooks said authorities need something probably more than just a Facebook posting for the killing to be considered a hate crime.

While investigators try to determine whether Urbanski should be charged with a hate crime, one fact is already apparent, the prosecutor said: Collins was a person who represented in every way possible the very best of this community.

He was already a person who had accomplished so much, she said, more than many of us will accomplish in a whole lifetime.",1

"Morris and Sussex County Prosecutors to take part in Bias Crime Training Program

Posted Sunday, September 17th, 2017

PUBLIC INVITED — LIMITED SEATS SO REGISTER SOON

In hopes of combatting bias crimes and incidents, the Morris and Sussex County Prosecutor’s Offices will join the New Jersey Office of the Attorney General, the New Jersey Division of Criminal Justice and the County Prosecutor’s Association of New Jersey in an Oct.2 training program at the Morris County Public Safety Training Academy on West Hanover Avenue in Parsippany.

The training will focus on how to recognize, respond to and report bias crimes and incidents. It is aimed at law enforcement officials, community leaders, chaplains, faith-based leaders and interested members of the public.

The program will also explore the distinction between a bias crime and a bias incident. A bias crime is a traditional criminal offense committed against individuals solely because of their race or gender. Bias incidents are race or gender-driven offenses such as harassing comments in the workplace or classroom that do not rise to the level of a crime.

Morris County Prosecutor Fredric M. Knapp said, “Now, perhaps more than ever, we need to be vigilant in fighting bigotry and bias. We look forward to working with our community partners in this joint effort.”

Sussex County Prosecutor Francis A. Koch said, “The program will expand our joint offices’ ability to work across jurisdictional boundaries and disciplines to help identify and successfully prosecute bias crimes.”

New Jersey Attorney General Christopher Porrino said, “New Jersey’s diversity is a tremendous source of strength and cultural richness for our residents. Bigotry and hatred, left unchecked, will undermine that strength and threaten our community by turning our differences into fear and tension. We will continue to do everything in our power to stand up against and prosecute illegal discrimination and bias related activity.”

Added Elie Honig, director, Division of Criminal Justice, “We are pleased to work with our county prosecutors and our community partners to combat bias crime. Training programs such as these allow us to reach individuals on the ground who are charged with recognizing bias and hate crimes. We expect that the participants will spread their knowledge and expand our reach, encouraging other members of the community to come forward and report bias crimes as well.”

A segment of the training will cover the role of community outreach, as it relates to local leaders, chaplains, interested community groups and county Human Relations Commissions.

There were 367 bias crimes in New Jersey in 2015, according to the New Jersey State Police, 26 of which occurred in Morris County. There were no bias crimes in Sussex County in 2015, but there were four in 2014.

As the State Police noted in an introduction to its 2015 Uniform Crime Report, the latest comprehensive data available, “crimes motivated by hate and bias tend to erode the basic fabric of society.”

The program will be held from 9 a.m. to noon with registration beginning at 8:30 a.m. Registration is available online by using the survey monkey web link of https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/FR6BYHQ

Early registration is encouraged because seats are expected to fill up quickly.

Questions about the program should be referred to David Leonardis of the State Division of Criminal Justice at [email protected] or Samantha DeNegri, Supervising Assistant Prosecutor at the Morris County Prosecutor’s Office, at [email protected].

"A 19-year-old man has been indicted for hate crimes connected to threats against Jewish community centers, as well as threatening the Israeli embassy and cyberstalking, the U.S. Justice Department said Wednesday.

Michael Kadar was arrested in Israel last year and is awaiting trial there. U.S. and Israeli authorities have previously charged him with making thousands of threats, including to airports, schools and Jewish centers, in the United States in 2016 and early 2017.

Kadar, who holds dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship, was indicted by grand juries in Florida, Georgia and the District of Columbia for making threats from January to March 2017, the Justice Department said in a statement.

The statement did not say whether he would be extradited to the United States.

​Threats in several states

Kadar is alleged to have telephoned the Anti-Defamation League with a bomb threat and making a bomb threat in an email to the Israeli embassy in Washington, both in March 2017, the Justice Department said.

Kadar, who is Jewish, was indicted for allegedly calling police in January 2017 about a hoax hostage situation at a home in Athens, Georgia, which included a threat to kill responding officers. Kadar also faces a federal cyberstalking indictment in Georgia.

In Florida, Kadar was charged with making multiple threatening calls about bomb threats and gun attacks against Jewish community centers throughout the state in January and February 2017. He also is alleged to have made bomb threats against the Orlando International Airport and a school.

The hoax threats to the Jewish community centers forced widespread evacuations and raised fears of a resurgence in anti-Semitism.

Advertised services

U.S. authorities have said in court documents that Kadar advertised his services on AlphaBay, a now-closed online black market, and offered to threaten any school for $30. The Justice Department shut AlphBay down in July 2017.

Israeli authorities have accused him of earning about $240,000 worth of the digital currency Bitcoin after selling his threat services on the dark web.

Kadars parents have said he has a brain tumor that caused autism and other mental problems, making him unable to understand the nature of his actions.

If convicted, Kadar faces up to 20 years in prison for each hate crime charge and a maximum of 10 years for each bomb threat charge. The interstate threats charge, the hoax charge and cyberstalking charge call for up to five years in prison apiece.",1
"“Women will change the nature of power, rather than power changing the nature of women.” The late activist and longtime women’s movement leader Bella Abzug made that prediction some two decades ago. And on Women’s Equality Day today, amidst especially troubling and uncertain times for America’s women and families, her words seem more fitting than ever.

Women’s Equality Day commemorates the day some women in the United States won the right to vote, when the 19th Amendment was ratified and added to the Constitution. It sent a clear and then-unprecedented message that women’s voices mattered and that, from then on, we would have a say in the decisions that affect our lives, our families and our country’s future. The right wasn’t just given to us; women and their allies struggled and sacrificed tremendously to achieve suffrage. But even then, and in the decades that followed, many women and people of color were denied the right to vote. Shameful efforts to disenfranchise communities continue today.

Ninety-seven years after what is often hailed as one of the greatest achievements toward women’s equality, despite decades of hard-fought progress, it is deeply frustrating and disheartening to feel like we’re moving backward. In addition to the despicable attacks on people’s voting rights that target people of color, our president campaigned on and continues to use misogyny, racism, xenophobia and bigotry to sow hatred and fear, rejecting our country’s values and its greatest strengths. Too few members of his party are stepping up to condemn or seriously challenge him. And white supremacists and bigots are emboldened and engaging in horrendous acts of intimidation and violence.

But there is another side to the nation’s story right now – the story of the power and persistence of women. Everywhere you look, women are mobilizing and organizing in inspiring ways to resist all efforts to take us backward, and to advance the policies we know our families and the country need, such as fair and living wages, nondiscrimination protections, paid family and medical leave, paid sick days, and access to quality and affordable health care, including comprehensive reproductive health care.

The millions of people who turned out for the Women’s March and sister marches across the country were the first sign of just how critical and powerful women’s voices would be in the resistance. Since then, women in rural, suburban and urban areas have stepped up to share stories, hold community meetings, lead state and local advocacy campaigns, explore running for elected office, and more. Women are organizing the resistance in communities that voted for Trump. Women make up the overwhelming majority of people making resistance calls to Congress – 86 percent of them, according to one survey. And women of color in particular are leading the charge.

The same is true in Congress, where women have been some of the strongest voices in the resistance. They stood up for equality and against injustice and discrimination in immigration and the military. They asked tough questions of Trump’s unqualified cabinet nominees. Two Republican women in the Senate played a key role in stopping a health care bill that would have repealed the greatest advance for women’s health in a generation, causing millions to lose their coverage, defunding Planned Parenthood and denying millions access to essential preventive health services. At the same time, many women in Congress are championing the fair and family friendly policies women and families truly need.

Many organizations led by women are spearheading resistance and advocacy activities, too. Individual activist women in addition to those representing women’s groups, immigrant rights organizations, the LGBTQ community, communities of color and many others are increasingly gaining attention as inspiring and effective leaders in the resistance. Actresses, female athletes and women business leaders are also joining the chorus, calling out inequality and calling on lawmakers to act. Across many sectors and spheres of influence, women are using their voices and platforms to resist and to insist on equality.

Importantly, women’s rights are, at their core, human rights – rights that should belong to and empower all of us. The fact that many women are leading the resistance does not and should not diminish the essential work of men and a broad-based group of allies. We gain strength from our collective voice, and the resistance is – and must be – a reflection of our great nation. There is undeniably work to be done within the movement and progressive community to unify, to work better together and to lift each other up, but we share a common goal of equality for all, and we need the strength of our majority to overcome the divisive minority that holds power today.",1

"There were three incidents of hate crimes against Indian Americans in 2016 in New Jersey.

Three cases of hate crime were reported against Indian Americans in New Jersey in 2016, according to latest data released by the state. A total of 10 cases of hate crime against 10 Asians were reported in the same period, it added. Three of the hate crimes were against Hindus, of which two were against the individual, while one concerned damage to property.

Hate crimes had been declining since 2011 in the state that has a large population of Asians, including Indian Americans. However, there was an increase in hate crimes in 2016, although Indian Americans were less targeted.

There were 775 total reported incidents of hate crime in 2010, followed each successive year by 606, 553, 459, 373 and finally 367 in 2015. But there were 417 incidents in 2016. There were seven hate crimes against Asian Indians in 2015.

“It’s sad that we see bias incidents trending upward, but it’s not surprising, given that we have political leaders in this country who encourage the expression of intolerance and hatred, or in other cases, ignore or countenance it,” Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said on March 29, according to NJ.com. “What we need to do, as individuals and as a society, is to push back against this prejudice. We need to embrace the diversity that makes us stronger as a state and a nation, and we need to spread a countervailing message of tolerance and unity.”

There was an increase in hate crimes against Muslims in 2016, with 15 crimes reported against a person, seven against property, and four against Islamic public property. In 2015, hate crimes against Muslims increased 250 per cent in New Jersey. There were 14 crimes against Muslims in 2014 and 14 in 2015. Nationwide, hate crimes against Muslims increased by two-thirds in 2015 over 2014.

Jewish and African Americans also faced more crimes in 2016 than Asian Indians. There were 114 incidents of hate crimes against Jewish people, including property and public property while there were 127 hate crimes against African Americans.

Most of the offenders in the state were aged between 11 and 17 years. Fifty three offenders were in that age group while 50 victims were also between that age group. There were 144 male offenders and 149 male victims while there were 35 female offenders and 99 female victims.

Some of the hate crimes were also sexual in nature. Homosexual males were the most persecuted group as hate crimes against them numbered at 25 out of all 48 hate crimes that were sexual.",1

To Muslim women,

Islam is a religion of women. I will speak these words until my heart stops. Islam is a religion of women. Our prophet who was delivered the revelation may have been a man but his first and truest disciple was his wife. She was a woman of stature, endurance, patience and poise. And to reiterate what has already been said, she was a woman. With female hands was the first iftar made; with female hands was the first wudu done.

All the sanctified souls Rasulullah saw on his night journey were of women- We would have no Adam, John, Jesus, Joseph, Idries, Aaron, Moses, or Abraham without Eve, Elizabeth, Mary, Rachel, Barkanah, Jochebed, and Amathlaah. Even in the prophet’s family, although it was Hazrat Ali who went down in sajdah before the sword of his enemy and his son Hazrat Hussien who was massacred at Karbala – it was Hazrati Zainab, Rasulullah’s granddaughter, who was tasked to carry the weight of the carnage back to the believers, and subsequently, to the rest of time. It is Bivi Fatima, The Prophet’s daughter, who is said to come to the aid of the needy and the helpless. In her black chador do foreignness and aliment reside.

Islam lives in our wombs. The Shahada lives in our wombs. Salat lives in our wombs. Sawm lives in our wombs. Zakat lives in our wombs. Hajj lives in our wombs.

You have no Islam without women. It is on a woman’s back does Islam find its alter.

Islam is birthed by women. Islam is kept alive by women. Islam, in its submission and in its excellence, dies if its womenkind are not protected.

During the month of Ramadan in Muslim year 1438, women were not protected. Seventeen-year-old Nabra Hassanen was beaten to death while on her way to Qiyam prayer recently in her North Virgina hometown. Regardless of the fact that her death has not been ruled a direct hate crime—it comes at a time where Muslim women specifically face the brunt of Islamophobia, direct or indirect, both in this country and abroad.

Nabra stood as a pinnacle of what it means to be Muslim, to be a young woman, and to be a black American. She wore a head scarf and Islamic robes. She had chosen such symbols of devotion at a commendably young age. And whether her awful death was an outcome of that choice, we may never know for sure. But she does represent the fact that for veiled Muslim women, their existence is one that is often objectified into being purely a threat, and their lives are endangered at any given moment because of this. For black Muslims, this is only heightened by the racism already rampant in this nation. For Muslim women in general, it showcases that head scarf or not, Quranic name or not, pigmented skin or not, there is a real danger in existing as Muslim.

To Nabra I want to say that since your passing I have meditated on your name. It has become my zikr. I remember you. When the strength in my fast wanes, I remember you were not able to complete yours- I find strength in your name. In prayer for strength I call on many names; Muhammad, Hazrat Ali, Hazrat Hussein— but I do not forget yours, for it always comes next. You are a martyr of our times; who went out to pray and was faced with violence. As someone who has felt the physical end of Islamophobia – who has faced boys chasing her in elementary school hallways to pin her in bathroom stalls in order to berate and shame her, who has dealt with physical violence at the hands of other POC’s on middle school playgrounds and suburban back allies.

As someone who has felt the physical hands of hatred on her—Nabra I am sorry. I am sorry. I am sorry. I am sorry we could not protect you. And now, just like Hazrati Zainab, Bivi Fatima, and the rest of Muslim womankind, may you go down in history as being the definition of a devotee. Islamic history has a problem with remembering the women who represent it, but we will not forget you. May you rest in power sweet child. May you forever rest in power.

To Muslim women, I love you dearly. Regardless of what stage of Islam you operate in, regardless of how Muslim you feel—know you are valid and that I love you. You who birth Islam also face its largest burden—criticized, objectified, victimized both within the religion and without. Know that you carry the power that Zainab used to rally the believers in tragedy. Know that you carry the virtue of Bivi Khadijah’s first salat. Know that you carry the utter grace of Bivi Fatima and her devotion. Islam is not a religion of current parted mosques and patriarchal judgments. It is a religion of women. It belongs to you. It always has and it always will.

To those who do not value us—I will repeat what I started this piece with: Islam is a religion of women. I will speak these words until my heart stops. Islam is a religion of women. On a woman’s breath does Submission rest. Without us, you would not have the faith you try to use against us. I promise, you will fail time and time again to do so. Islam belongs to us. This will never change.",1

"SAN MATEO COUNTY, CA — A man who picked up his girlfriend from her last shift at San Francisco International Airport last week and planned to move with her to Las Vegas was fatally shot by a fellow SFO worker who sought a romantic relationship with her, San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said this week. Kevin Prasad, 31, of South San Francisco, and Donovan Rivera, 25, of Hayward, are charged in the murder of 31-year-old Mark Mangaccat last Wednesday. That day, Mangaccat drove to pick up his girlfriend, the mother of their 3-year-old child. Prasad, who worked at SFO with her, had been trying to develop a romantic relationship with her and urged her to dump Mangaccat but she had rebuffed his advances, prosecutors said. Rivera allegedly drove Prasad as they followed Mangaccat, who picked up his girlfriend and returned to their home on Abbot Avenue in Daly City. As Mangaccat was backing the vehicle into the garage, Prasad allegedly walked up and fired five to six shots into the car, killing him while not hitting the girlfriend, prosecutors said. The working proposition for the motive is, If I kill him and get him out of the way, then I could be there to start the relationship with the grieving widow, Wagstaffe said. Thats pretty bizarre. Wagstaffe said the couple was planning on moving to Las Vegas after living with Mangaccats family in Daly City and said last Wednesday had been the girlfriends last shift. Following the shooting, Prasad allegedly ran back to the car and Rivera drove them away from the scene, but investigators were able to identify and arrest them a day later, according to Wagstaffe. The two defendants made their initial court appearance Monday on murder charges with a special circumstance of lying in wait. They did not enter pleas and will return to court on May 8 for appearance of their appointed Private Defender Program attorneys and to possibly enter pleas. Daly City police have not released any information about the case and referred any inquiries about it to the district attorneys office. Social media posts about Mangaccat mourned his death. He was one of the nicest people, one post read. I still cant believe it.Meanwhile, three weeks ago Prasad apparently testified at a San Francisco Board of Supervisors hearing on raising minimum wages for workers, saying he was a security officer at SFO who is also a veteran and part of the working poor. The clip of Prasad speaking at the hearing was posted on the Facebook page for Airport Workers United, a union of airport workers.

"Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo, who seem perpetually on the verge of main eventing SummerSlam at the Barclays Center, put their differences aside this morning and announced that in the wake of a bomb threat against the Jewish Childrens Museum, the city and state were teaming up to offer a new cash reward for anyone who had information that led to an arrest and conviction in a suspected hate crime.

According to a joint press release from the two officials, the city and state have partnered to increase the reward offered for information leading to a hate crimes conviction from $5,000 to $20,000. The recent spate of threats against our Jewish community are threats against all of us. Those directed at children are particularly disturbing. As New Yorkers, we stand united in the face of cowardly tactics designed to frighten, disrupt and divide us, de Blasio said in a statement announcing the reward.

“The Statue of Liberty holds the torch high in New York’s Harbor, an eternal reminder that our state will always be the beacon for tolerance and acceptance. We have zero tolerance for intolerance, and I encourage all New Yorkers to report any instance of hate, bias or discrimination, Cuomo said in a statement.

On top of the bomb threat against the Jewish Childrens Museum yesterday, a bomb threat was also called into the Jewish Association Services for the Aged in Midwood this morning. John Miller, the head of the NYPDs intelligence unit, told CBS this morning that the department believes a single person using a spoofing device to hide their identity is behind the majority of the calls.

100 hate crimes have been reported in New York City since the beginning of 2017 according to the press release, which is more than twice as many reported hate crimes than in the same period in 2016. Last year, through mid-November, there was a 31.5 percent increase in bias crimes when compared to the same time period in 2015.

In addition to the increased reward thats being offered, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and 17 other senators sent a letter to Department of Homeland Security head General John Kelly asking him to increase federal funds programmed to the Nonprofit Security Grant Program and give it $50 million in funding. The NSGP provides funding for security enhancements for non-profits that are under a high threat of terrorist attack.

In the letter asking for the funding, Gillibrand and the other senators mentioned the 100 threats to JCCs around the country and the instances of Jewish cemetery vandalism nationwide, in addition to cases like a violent bigot who shot a Sikh man in Seattle after yelling at him to go back to your country and an incident in Dearborn, Michigan in which someone called a mosque and told someone there that Muslims should be eradicated.",1

His sentencing is scheduled for March 10, 2011. Its the second time in the last month that Watson has been brought to a federal jury on charges of tampering with a witness.

"Around the world, Muslims are partaking in festivities for Eid-ul-Fitr, a religious holiday celebrating the end of a month-long fast. At home, in the U.S., the day also marks the end to another violent Ramadan representative of a larger pattern of intensifying Islamophobia.

While the murders of two American heroes, Ricky John Best and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche, in Oregon and a Muslim American teenager, Nabra Hassenan, near her local mosque in Virginia received considerable news coverage, a number of lesser-known acts and threats of anti-Muslim violence contributed to continued concerns about the minority faith group’s safety and security, not to mention the status of religious freedom in practice.

American Muslim Leadership Council American heroes, Ricky John Best, Micah Fletcher and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche, stood up to anti-Muslim hate.

Alarmingly, over the course of a mere 30 days, fasting Muslims consumed a regular diet of physical assaults, verbal harassment and mosque attacks, among other Islamophobic incidents around the country. Consider the following distressing events:

In New York, a Manhattan mosque received a threatening letter promising a massacre “on a scale never seen before;”

In Boston, MA, a male passenger on a train physically assaulted a 61 year old Muslim American woman observing hijab after yelling Islamophobic slurs;

In the Bronx, NY, a pellet gun shooter targeted a local mosque causing property damage;

In Mathis, TX, a Muslim owned convenience store – that had previously received threats such as, “You are Muslim, we are going to burn your store,” – was set ablaze in an arson;

In Denver, Colorado, mosques received a rash of hateful phone calls threatening violence;

In Hickory Hills, Chicago, Muslim American teenage girls observing hijab were harassed while dining at a local restaurant;

In Kent, Washington, a Muslim high school staff member received a threatening note stating, “F―― + Ramadan + All Muslims;”

In Columbus, Ohio, an attacker yelled, “You will be shipped back to Africa,” at a Muslim woman observing hijab prior to beating her unconscious;

In Santa Barbara, CA, a group of men verbally accosted a Muslim woman walking on a local college campus, laughing while threatening to get a gun;

In South Florida, a mosque was evacuated after receiving a bomb threat;

In Portland, OR, a man yelled “take the burka off, this is America, go back to your f***ing country,” at a Muslim couple while making hand gestures in the shape of a gun and pulling the “trigger;” and

In Sacramento, CA, Muslims found desecrated Qur’ans outside two mosques.

Mic.com Rahma Warsame was beaten unconscious in Columbus, Ohio.

To better understand the traumatic impact of such anti-Muslim attacks in Ramadan, imagine celebrating Hanukah, Christmas, Diwali or Easter in a political and social climate strewn with such hatred. To be sure, rising Islamophobia isn’t confined to the Islamic holy month. Rather, it is part of a broader phenomenon threatening religious freedom every day in our country. In fact, according to the Council on American Islamic , acts and threats of perceived anti-Muslim violence increased by 44 percent in 2016.

Significantly, contemporary manifestations of Islamophobia also include unlawful discrimination in a variety of other contexts. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, for instance, approximately 40 per cent of its investigations into violations of federal religious land use law – that protects houses of worship and religious institutions from discrimination by zoning officials – involve Muslim Americans.

Additionally, data from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal government agency tasked with enforcing civil rights laws in the workplace, reveal that Muslim Americans account for 40 percent of all religious employment discrimination claims – a marked increase from 25 percent in 2009. And, according to the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, more than 40 percent of Muslim American parents report that their children have experienced bias-based bullying in school.

WILX Muslim American teenage girls were verbally harassed while dining at a local restaurant in Chicago.

In other words, while Muslim Americans comprise just one to two percent of the entire U.S. population, the minority faith community is confronting grossly disproportionate levels of religious discrimination at work, in schools and the public square. But, now that you know this, what are you going to do in response?

In fact, amid growing Islamophobia, Americans have only one winning choice: stand united with your Muslim neighbors, classmates and co-workers against the forces of hatred and division that threatens who we are as a nation.

And, so, while Ramadan may be drawing to a close, our shared struggle to protect religious freedom, the rule of law and our national values is only just beginning.",1
"Teen charged with hate crime for holding gay man captive for 4 days, torturing him

A teen was arrested and charged with a hate crime after he allegedly kept a 50-year-old gay man captive in a basement for four days, beating and starving him.

The alleged victim, Otoni Eliseu, was discovered after someone called in a police report about a man being beaten with a bat.

Now Jackson Sugrue, 19, of the Boston suburb of Framingham, is facing a hate crime charge. Eliseu says Sugrue screamed homophobic slurs as Sugrue beat him.

When police arrived at the scene, Eliseu was lying on the ground covered in blood and bruises, wearing only a pair of pants.

Eliseu was reportedly living in the woods and was staying in the local church basement. The two men had used crack before Sugrue turned violent.

“On Saturday,” reports Boston 25, “the prosecution alleges Sugrue pulled Eliseu from his bed onto the floor and began attacking him repeatedly by stepping on his throat and choking him. Eliseu claims it was a hate crime because he is gay.”

“He attacked me on my back, on my butt, [saying] ‘you’re gay, you like me,’” said Eliseu.

Sugrue’s attorney, Kenneth Gross, claims Sugrue was the real victim.

“[Eliseu] was trying to entice my client to do things that were against his nature,” Gross said.

“My son is a victim of a 50-year-old man,” said Terry Sugrue, the father of the alleged attacker.

“This is someone we tried to help,” he added. “He became obsessed with my son.”

"From the moment the world first learned that Prince Harry was dating Meghan Markle, racist trolls have been crawling out of the woodwork to spew their hateful bile.

These days, Harry and Meghan are engaged, so naturally, the worlds worst people have ramped up their efforts to frighten and harass the couple.

The Guardian is reporting today that Scotland Yard is investigating an envelope of white powder that was mailed to Kensington Palace and addressed to Harry and Meghan.

Police are treating the incident as a racially-motivated hate crime.

Investigators suspect that the envelope contained anthrax, but they have yet to release the results of a toxicology test.

Of course, even if it turns out the powder is something far less harmful, the fact remains that the perpetrator intended to scare Harry and Meghan, to make them feel unsafe in their own home.

Sadly, this incident isnt entirely surprising.

Its hard to believe - especially given how beloved she is on this side of the pond - but some Brits are not happy about the idea of Harry marrying Meghan.

Some say its because Meghan is divorced.

Others claim its because shes an actress.

And a surprising number just come right out and admit theyre racist.

We suppose their honesty would be refreshing if theyre bigotry wasnt so nauseating.

A recent collection of comments posted on the Daily Mails website in response to an article about Harry and Meghan gives you an idea of the sort of vitriol thats at work here:

A DIVORCEE BARELY a Z-list actress! wrote one caps-loving psychopath.

This is going to be a JOKEfest of a SHAM wedding!

CANT STAND THE WITCH SHE IS GOING TO BE THE DOWNFALL OF THE ROYAL FAMILY!!! remarked another level-headed gent.

An almost 40-year-old divorcee who appears used up, tongue hanging out and slapping high fives and taking selfies along her carriage route, another basement-dweller wrote of Meghan.

You get the idea.

These people seem unaware that the Church of England literally only exists because of a divorce, but theres no point in arguing with them, anyway.

Living well is the best revenge, and it doesnt get much better than life as a princess.",1

"On June 8, 2017, Bree Nece and her sister Gina Nino attended a New Kids on the Block concert at the KeyArena in Seattle, Washington. They stopped for a late night snack at the Palace Restaurant, and on their way back to their hotel, The Kings Inn, they were approached by a woman in her mid to late 30s, accompanied by two men.

The incident

Bree claims that the woman handed her a yellow balloon and struck up a friendly conversation about the concert. When the woman discovered that Bree was from Kennewick, Washington in Eastern Washington state, a more conservative area, she stated that she hoped Bree hadnt voted for Trump.

When Bree admitted that she had, the encounter took a turn for the worse.

Bree claims that the female began screaming at her and her sister, calling them racist. Shortly after, the two men joined in the verbal assault. One of the men came at her and punched her in the face as her sister Gina stood by, watching helplessly. As Gina tried to pull the man off Bree she was punched in the face. Shortly after, the man kicked Bree in the face and ribs as she tried to protect her sister.

After the trio left, Bree got to her feet. Shortly after, one of the men came back from around the corner, accosted her, slammed her onto the concrete, grabbed her hair and dragged her across the sidewalk. There were three witnesses, and the two men were arrested but released the following day. Bree Nece believes that the trio mentioned the words antifascist or ANTIFA, an acronym standing for antifascist, with groups across the nation.

Top Videos of the Day

Bree stated to this reporter that although no one came to our aid, we are grateful the three witnesses made statements. She went on to say, Without them, the men wouldve never been caught.

Messaging with her on Facebook, Bree said, The prosecutors have filed charges on them and their pretrial is set for July 31st. My sister spoke with them this morning. We are patiently waiting on the official police report.

She ended our conversation with, Our mother fears for our safety, but we need this to be heard. I wont lie and say im not nervous but we cant let hate win. God bless.

"The IRS and local officials want residents to know if they receive a call from the IRS to be careful, it could be a phone scam. The scams, which have been circulating for more than a year, are continuing and residents should be aware this is happening, that despite what you see on your Caller ID they can be altered and it may not, in fact, be the IRS calling and threatening you. These unsolicited calls are coming from individuals demanding payment while fraudulently claiming to be from the IRS. More than a thousand people have been victims of this scam nationwide and have lost an estimated $5 million from these scams, according to the IRS. There are clear warning signs about these scams, which continue at high levels throughout the nation, said IRS Commissioner John Koskinen in a statement last year that has recirculated this week. Taxpayers should remember their first contact with the IRS will not be a call from out of the blue, but through official correspondence sent through the mail. A big red flag for these scams are angry, threatening calls from people who say they are from the IRS and urging immediate payment. This is not how we operate. People should hang up immediately and contact TIGTA or the IRS. Additionally, it is important for taxpayers to know that the IRS: Potential phone scam victims may be told that they owe money that must be paid immediately to the IRS or they are entitled to big refunds. When unsuccessful the first time, sometimes phone scammers call back trying a new strategy. Other characteristics of these scams include: What should you do If you get a phone call from someone claiming to be from the IRS?

"But yesterday, King James took the time out to address his Los Angeles home being vandalized with the N-word spray painted on its front gate. More than anything, the three-time NBA champion thinks the hate crime is a cruel reminder of how racism will always be a part of the world and that being Black in America is tough.

As I sit here on the eve of one of the greatest sporting events we have, race and what is going on comes again, James told the media Wednesday afternoon, as reported by ESPN. On my behalf, familys behalf, I look at this as if this sheds a light and keeps the conversation going. My family is safe, thats most important.

As it was reported earlier in the day, neither James nor his family was at the home during the time the hate crime took place. LAPD investigators are busy trying to review neighbors security footage to see if they could pinpoint the perpetrator. The word has since been covered up on the property.

Just shows that racism will always be a part of the world, part of America, James continued. Hate in America, especially for African-Americans, is living every day. It is hidden most days. It is alive every single day. I think back to Emmett Tills mom and the reason she had an open casket, she wanted to show the world what her son went through in terms of a hate crime in America. No matter how much money you have, how famous you are, how much people admire you, being Black in America is tough.

James purchased the 9,440 square-foot home for $20.9 million back in 2015, making it a summer home residence for his family.

"According to a Fairfax County Police Department spokesperson, the investigation into the slaying of a 17-year-old girl in Virginia is not being investigated as a hate crime at this time. Based on the information that detectives have, theres no indication that this was a hate or bias crime, FCPD spokesperson Don Gotthardt tells Bustle of the investigation into the murder allegedly committed by a 22-year-old man. Gotthardt declined to identify the victim, but media reports have named the deceased teenage girl as Nabra Hassanen.

Early Sunday morning, after she attended a Dulles-area mosques midnight Ramadan prayers, Hassanen and her friends were confronted by a motorist as they walked back to the mosque from a nearby IHOP. The motorist confronted the group and all but one — Hassanen — ran back to the mosque. Remains believed to belong to the girl were later found in a nearby pond.

After reports spread that the Hassanens murder may be under investigation as a hate crime, the FCPD tweeted, We are NOT investigating this murder as a hate crime; however, Gotthardt says that if, as the investigation progresses, the murder does seem to have been motivated by bias, detectives will exhaust all investigative leads. Under the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009, hate crimes are defined as crimes in which the perpetrators acted based on a bias against the victims race, color, religion, or national origin, as well as those based on biases of actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or gender, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigations website.

According to the Southern Poverty Law Centers 2016 hate census, last year saw a dramatic increase in the number of anti-Muslim hate groups in the U.S: from 34 in 2015 to 101 in 2016. Overall, the SPLC report notes, the number of hate groups in the U.S. rose from 892 in 2015 to 917 in 2016. The Pew Centers analysis of the FBIs anti-Muslim hate crime statistics showed that in 2015, American Muslims faced the same level of bias-related violence as they did in the post-9/11 era.

Members of the Fairfax County Muslim community said they were taken aback by the killing. We are devastated and heartbroken as our community undergoes and processes this traumatic event, Rizwan Jaka, chairman of the All Dulles Area Muslim Society, the mosque where Hassenen attended prayers, said in a statement. It is a time for us to come together to pray and care for our youth.",1

TRUMP JR.’S WIKILEAKS EXCHANGE ADDS INTRIGUE TO RUSSIA PROBE

WASHINGTON (AP) – President Donald Trump’s oldest son released a series of private Twitter exchanges between himself and WikiLeaks during and after the 2016 election, including pleas from the website to publicize its leaks. Donald Trump Jr.’s release of the messages on Twitter came hours after The Atlantic first reported them Monday. In the exchanges — some of them around the time that the website was releasing the stolen emails from Democrat Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman — WikiLeaks praises his father’s positive comments about WikiLeaks and asks Trump Jr. to release his father’s tax returns to the site. The revelations are sure to increase calls in Congress to have Trump Jr. testify publicly as part of several committee probes into Russian interference in the 2016 election. And they add a new element to the investigations that have been probing for months whether Trump’s campaign colluded in any way with the Russian government.

THE LATEST: MCCONNELL: GOP STILL HOPES TO KEEP ALABAMA SEAT

WASHINGTON (AP) – The Senate’s top Republican says the party still hopes to retain an Alabama Senate seat at the center of a scandal involving GOP nominee Roy Moore.

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday: “We would hope to save the seat and that might require a write-in” campaign. McConnell says he expects to discuss the issue with President Donald Trump once he returns to Washington. The national party has turned against Moore, a Christian conservative accused of molesting teenage girls during the late 1970s when he was in his 30s. Trump has remained quiet while on an extended trip to Asia. McConnell says with the Dec. 12 election three weeks away, “it’s a very complicated matter” to try to retain the seat. Moore can’t be knocked off the ballot under Alabama law.

RISE IN TEEN SUICIDE, SOCIAL MEDIA COINCIDE; IS THERE LINK?

CHICAGO (AP) – An increase in suicide rates among U.S. teens occurred at the same time social media use surged and a new analysis suggests there may be a link. Suicide rates for teens rose between 2010 and 2015 after they had declined for nearly two decades, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Why the rates went up isn’t known. The study doesn’t answer the question, but it suggests that one factor could be rising social media use. Recent teen suicides have been blamed on cyberbullying, and social media posts depicting “perfect” lives may be taking a toll on teens’ mental health, researchers say. “After hours of scrolling through Instagram feeds, I just feel worse about myself because I feel left out,” said Caitlin Hearty, a 17-year-old Littleton, Colorado, high school senior who helped organize an offline campaign last month after several local teen suicides. “No one posts the bad things they’re going through,” said Chloe Schilling, also 17, who helped with the campaign, in which hundreds of teens agreed not to use the internet or social media for one month.’ Use of smartphones and social media is important, and so is setting reasonable limits, she said.

SESSIONS DENIES LYING ON RUSSIA, PLEADS HAZY MEMORY

WASHINGTON – Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Tuesday displayed a hazy memory of the Trump campaign’s discussions about and dealings with Russians in the 2016 election, denying he ever lied to Congress about those contacts but blaming the chaos of the race for fogging his recollections. During more than five hours of testimony to Congress, Sessions sought to explain away apparent contradictions in his earlier accounts by citing the exhausting nature of Donald Trump’s upstart but surging bid for the White House. He also denied under repeated questioning from Democrats that he had been influenced by Trump. But after saying under oath months ago that he was unaware of any relationship between the campaign and Russia, Sessions acknowledged for the first time that the arrest of a low-level campaign adviser reminded him after all of a meeting at which the aide, George Papadopoulos, proposed setting up a get-together between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. “After reading his account and to the best of my recollection,” Sessions told the House Judiciary Committee, “I believe that I wanted to make clear to him that he was not authorized to represent the campaign with the Russian government or any other foreign government for that matter. “But I did not recall this event, which occurred 18 months before my testimony of a few weeks ago,” he added, “and I would gladly have reported it had I remembered it because I pushed back against his suggestion that I thought may have been improper.”

GUNMAN PICKING RANDOM TARGETS KILLS 4 IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

RED BLUFF, Calif. (AP) – A gunman choosing targets at random opened fire in a rural Northern California town Tuesday, killing four people at several sites and wounding others at an elementary school before police shot him dead, authorities said.The gunfire began around 8 a.m. in the community of Rancho Tehama Reserve, about 130 miles north of Sacramento.Police offered no immediate word on the assailant’s motive, but a sheriff’s official said the shooter’s neighbors had reported a domestic violence incident.“It was very clear at the onset that we had an individual that was randomly picking targets,” Tehama County Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston said. Witnesses reported hearing gunshots and children screaming at an elementary school about five miles down a road from where the shooting is believed to have started. Several people were wounded at the school, said Jeanine Quist, an administrative assistant with the Corning Union Elementary School District. Salvador Tello said the gunman fired at a truck in front of him as he was dropping off his three children. Tello said he was about three blocks from the school when bullets made “big holes” in the truck in front of him. He said he forced his children to duck down and slammed his truck into reverse and headed to the children’s grandmother’s house. “I put my kids down and put my truck in reverse and went out,” he said. “I don’t believe it because I wake up, take my kids, feed them cereal and put them in the truck and says ‘Let’s go to school like a normal day.’” On the way, he said, he saw an apparent gunshot victim and police at another scene. Details were still sketchy hours after the shootings, and authorities did not have a firm count of the wounded due to the number of places the gunman attacked, Johnston said. Authorities recovered a semi-automatic rifle and two handguns.

WISCONSIN FIREFIGHTERS UNION HEAD RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR

MADISON, Wis. (AP) – The Democratic head of the state firefighters union launched his candidacy Monday to take on Republican Gov. Scott Walker, looking to avenge a defeat in the 2012 recall while also attempting to become Wisconsin’s first African American governor. Mahlon Mitchell, a Madison firefighter who lives in the suburb of Fitchburg, said he was running because “after eight years of Scott Walker, it’s time for change.” “I look at Madison, and see Governor Walker who now wants to be in office for 12 years!? Over a decade?!” Mitchell tweeted on Monday. “He spent last year running for president: Wisconsin was Walker’s Plan B. He’s already had eight years in office, and he’s failed us, the people of Wisconsin!” Walker’s campaign spokesman Nathan Craft responded by not addressing Mitchell directly, but instead saying Walker is seeking a third term because “there’s more to be done.” Mitchell, like Walker, grew up in Delavan. But at 40, he is a decade younger than Walker who turned 50 earlier this month. Mitchell was outspoken against Walker’s proposal in 2011 that effectively ended collective bargaining for most public workers. It did not apply to police and firefighters, but as head of the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin Mitchell led marches in opposition and then ran for lieutenant governor in the 2012 recall.

FBI STATISTICS SHOW HATE CRIMES RISE IN MINNESOTA IN 2016

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) – Hate crimes in Minnesota rose for the second straight year in 2016, with the bulk of crimes motivated by the victim’s race or ethnicity. Crimes were also committed against victims because of their religion or sexual orientation. The FBI released its 2016 hate crime statistics report Monday. Minnesota reported 119 hate crimes last year, up from 109 in 2015. Nationally, there were more than 6,100 hate crimes in 2016, up about 5 percent over the previous year.The yearly report is the most comprehensive accounting of hate crimes in the U.S. But authorities warn it’s incomplete, partly because it’s based on voluntary reporting by police agencies. The number of participating agencies also varies from year to year.Minnesota’s 2016 figures come from just 10 percent of participating agencies statewide.

ALLEGATIONS AGAINST ROY MOORE ROIL US EVANGELICAL RANKS

For many evangelicals, fiery Alabama politician and judge Roy Moore has been a longtime hero. Others have sometimes cringed at his heated rhetoric and bellicose style. Now, as Moore’s Republican U.S. Senate campaign is imperiled by allegations of sexual overtures to a 14-year-old girl when he was in his 30s, there’s an outpouring of impassioned and soul-searching discussion in evangelical ranks. “This is one of those excruciating decision moments for evangelicals,” Albert Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, said in a telephone interview. “These allegations, if true, are devastating. If true, this is a very big deal.” Mohler said Alabama voters face a potentially wrenching task of trying to determine if the allegations – Moore has emphatically denied them – are credible. According the Pew Research Center, 49 percent of Alabama adults are evangelical Protestants. For some of them, the Moore allegations echo the quandary they faced last year, wrestling over whether to support Donald Trump in the presidential race despite his crude sexual boasts. The Rev. Robert Franklin, professor of moral leadership at Emory University’s Candler School of Theology in Atlanta, said The Washington Post’s report about the Moore allegations represents a test of “moral consistency” for evangelicals. “Evangelicals are steadily losing their moral authority in the larger public square by intensifying their uncritical loyalty to Donald Trump,” Franklin wrote in an email. “Since this is Roy Moore and not Donald Trump, I think there may be significant disaffection with him, and increased demands for his removal from the ballot.”",1
"A Bowie State University student who was supposed to graduate on Tuesday was remembered after he was stabbed to death on the College Park campus of the University of Maryland. News4s Jackie Bensen reports.

The young man stabbed and killed in a random attack on the University of Maryland campus Saturday could make friends no matter what group he was around, his father remembered.

Richard Collins III was a competitor and athlete. He loved lacrosse and soccer. He was a runner, said his father, Richard Collins Jr.

Collins had just been commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Army, and he prided himself on his time and in his ROTC unit on being the top runner in his PTs, remembered his father. He even won a certificate for being the best.

He was just competitive at heart, and had a loving and giving heart, the father said, his pain obvious as he spoke about his son.

He would go out of his way, sometimes to my chagrin, to try and help others. But you want to try to encourage that in your children.

In court, a judge held Urbanski without bond at an appearance Monday afternoon.

He is an absolute danger to the community, she said.

Urbanskis parents attended the hearing. As prosecutors stated the charges, the accused attackers father closed his eyes.

Urbanski appeared on a video monitor, wearing an orange jumpsuit. He did not speak.

His lawyer cited media reports saying Urbanski had been intoxicated at the time of the crime. He requested bond, drug counseling and GPS monitoring for Urbanski, but the judge refused.

Outside the courtroom, Urbanskis father declined to comment. His mother tried to cover her face.

Students Tweet About Racial Issues on Campus

Fear the turtle is normally a rallying cry on the University of Maryland campus. But that hashtag took on a very different tone as students of color tweeting their experiences of racism at UMd. News4s Shomari Stone reports. (Published Monday, May 22, 2017)

The University of Maryland police sought the FBIs help after learning Urbanski is a member of a Facebook group called Alt-Reich Nation.

Suffice it to say that its despicable. It shows extreme bias against women, Latinos, members of the Jewish faith and especially African Americans, Mitchell said at a news conference Sunday.

The case is making headlines as a possible hate crime, but the FBI and the Prince George’s County state’s attorney said that determination will take more time, while the circumstances of the crime are investigated first. The FBI said they are assisting in some of the aspects of the investigation.



We are here to evaluate that as an ongoing concern with respect to whether or not this was a hate crime, said Gordon Johnson, special agent in charge of the FBI field office in Baltimore.

Collins father told NBC News he was in shock.

Im in no place to feel very many emotions beside sadness and just a deep sense of personal loss, he said.

A parents worst nightmare has just reached my doorstep, he continued.

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan expressed outrage on his Facebook page about the attack while sending deepest condolences to the family, friends and college communities.

The individual responsible for this young man’s death must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, Hogan wrote. Violence and hatred have no place in our communities and will never be tolerated. In the wake of this senseless tragedy, I ask that all Marylanders show strength and come together in this time of grieving.

Before Collins was stabbed, he was standing at a bus stop with two friends near the University of Marylands Montgomery Hall on Regents Drive about 3 a.m. Saturday, police said.

Court documents obtained by News4 say Collins was waiting for the universitys shuttle bus with his friends when they realized the shuttle bus had stopped running for the night. They decided to call an Uber and were waiting for one to arrive when they heard Urbanski screaming nearby, the documents say.

Collins and his friends watched Urbanski approach them.

Step left, step left if you know whats best for you, witnesses told police Urbanski said.

No, Collins reportedly replied.

Urbanski continued to approach Collins and his friends. Then, he pulled out a knife with a 3- to 4-inch silver blade and stabbed Collins once in the chest, the documents say.

It never gets any worse than this, the University of Maryland police chief said. When I sat with the victims father, who is a military veteran, and his pastor, and we shed tears together ... I can tell you, it rips your heart out.

Brian Douglas, who got to know Collins when they took a class together, said the man was looking forward to graduation.

He was just nice, just a good young man all around. You cant find those too often in todays society, Douglas said.

Ciera Sorrell, who also took a class with Collins, said his killing shocked the Bowie State community.

Everyone is in disbelief, she said. He seemed so excited to get to live his life, and he doesnt have that chance anymore.

The attack has sparked fear on the University of Maryland campus.

If Im a person of color, I would certainly look at this as something that could happen to me. In fact, I know on Facebook our students are saying that, Mitchell said.

FBI Joins Investigation Into Deadly Stabbing at UMd.

The FBI is helping the University of Maryland police department investigate whether Saturdays deadly stabbing was motivated by hate. News4s Darcy Spencer has our report. (Published Sunday, May 21, 2017)

Campus police have stepped up patrols on and around campus.

Dr. Artie Lee Travis, vice president for student affairs at Bowie State University, said the school hopes the investigation moves forward as quickly as possible.

Hate has no place in America, he said. Hate has no place on a college campus, where young minds are coming together to try to change the world.

Urbanski, of Severna Park, Maryland, is being held without bond.

A vigil for Collins is scheduled for Monday evening on Bowie States campus.

On the University of Maryland campus, flowers and candles were placed at the bus stop where Collins life was taken.

"Manhattan Ave Ticket Trap, Bearded Burglars, & Williamsburg Hate Crime — The Hook-Up 4/17

The L Train shutdown could totally transform 14th Street as we know it.

Think twice before you try parking on Manhattan Avenue between Huron and India. It’s a “ticket trap”.

Shooting so many movies and TV shows in Greenpoint and Williamsburg is both a blessing and a curse. It makes our restaurants and shops more popular, but isn’t always the most convenient.

Via 6Sqft: “Shooting in Greenpoint, Brooklyn continues to gain in popularity for many studios. Tina Fey’s show, “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” paid a Greenpoint homeowner about $1,500 to shoot on her brownstone’s front steps. Rolf Carle, a woodworker in Greenpoint, started a Facebook page that lets neighbors share information and vent about the shoots taking over their streets. According to Carle, as many as 50 shoots occurred in a single week in Greenpoint and Williamsburg, sometimes filming until midnight.”

Are beards the new burglar masks? Pokito in Williamsburg was robbed this week by a bearded man.

Two gay men in Williamsburg had a brick thrown at them on the corner of Bedford and Grand during daylight hours.

Via Gothamist: “NYPD officers apprehended two teenage male suspects, ages 13 and 15, near the Williamsburg intersection and arrested them. Both were charged with assault as a hate crime and aggravated harassment. A police spokesperson confirmed they will be tried as juveniles.”",1

Maan Singh Khalsa said he used to assume the best in others.

But after two Texas men savagely attacked him in Richmond in September — leaving him with one less finger, and severe emotional and physical trauma — the 42-year-old information-technology specialist now evaluates any stranger as a possible threat to his safety.

Khalsa made it though one phase of his trauma Thursday, though, when his attackers admitted to their crimes and were sentenced to three years in state prison each for the hate-crime assault.

“I have suffered from severe depression, anxiety and PTSD since the attack,” Khalsa said in court, reading from a statement before the sentencing of the men who assaulted him. “It is difficult for me to go outside now without having pepper spray with me. Now, when I interact with strangers, I am not as open as I used to be — I am more likely to view others not as my brothers, but as possible threats to my safety.”

The attackers, Colton Leblanc, 24, of Winnie, Texas, and Chase Little, 31, of Beaumont, Texas, each pleaded no contest to one count of assault with force causing great bodily injury in Contra Costa County Superior Court in Martinez. The assault carried with it hate-crime enhancements because prosecutors said the men attacked Khalsa because of his religion.

Khalsa, who immigrated to California from India in 2003 and has an 8-year-old daughter, is a Sikh and wears a turban over his hair that he keeps unshorn as part of his religion.

Neither defendant spoke during the hearing as the two stood attentively behind a glass partition in their yellow jail clothes.

“I’m satisfied with how this was resolved,” defense attorney Joseph Tully said after the court hearing. “It was in the best interest of everyone involved in this case.”

The assault began on the night of Sept. 25, when five men in a white pickup truck pulled up next to Khalsa at a stoplight at Blume and Hilltop drives in Richmond, and one of the men inside hurled a half-full beer can at him.

Khalsa got out of his car and told the men, “You forgot something” before throwing the can back at the truck. That apparently set off some of the men inside, who began screaming and cursing at him.

Khalsa drove east on Hilltop and called 911, but as he reached another stoplight at the intersection at the Interstate 80 overpass, two men jumped out of the truck and began their assault.

The assailants, later identified as Leblanc and Little, punched Khalsa in the face through his open window, yelled profanities and knocked off his turban. Little then pulled out a knife and cut Khalsa’s hair and stabbed him in the hand.

The attackers, who were in town on contract assignments at the Chevron refinery in Richmond, were arrested shortly after the incident.

Doctors later had to amputate Khalsa’s right pinkie, which was badly cut.

“This is as disturbing a crime as you can be involved in,” Contra Costa County deputy district attorney Simon O’Connell said after Thursday’s hearing. “Thankfully, these individuals are being punished and our community can now move on.”

Khalsa said the attack has “greatly affected every facet of my life.” He suffered damaged teeth and a black eye, and had cuts and bruises on his face.

On top of the physical and emotional toll, he has paid thousands of dollars in medical bills, has had to take time off from his job as an IT specialist for the Social Security Administration, and has cut back on his charity work.

“It will take me many years, maybe the rest of my life, to heal from this attack,” he said.

And while Khalsa recovers from the ordeal, he said he takes solace in his Sikh faith and his belief that “all of us are one human family.”

“Mr. Little and Mr. Leblanc, I hope that one day you will come to share this view,” he said, addressing his attackers in court. “I still consider you my brothers, and I hope that you will learn about me and my community, and one day consider me your brother, too.”

"With this week being Police Week, a number of community members have offered their heartfelt thanks to the men and women in blue this week. The week includes area law enforcement officials honoring those who were disabled or died in the line of duty. More than 19,000 names of fallen law enforcement officers are etched into the walls of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial — and more are added every year. So why is Police Week important? Police officers are hired to protect the public, said Caledonia Police Chief Toby Schey. Its important that the public realize the work we do to serve them. Sometimes we put our lives on the line and someone who goes into law enforcement understands that we may have to sacrifice our lives to save someone else. As police officers we do this every day to protect the public. Schey pointed to what happened with officer Jim Gardiner last week. During a fire, Gardiner broke into a home that was on fire to get a family of four to safety. Going into that house that was on fire, Im sure he didnt know if he was going to come out alive, Schey said. Schey said the community has been lucky that no officers have been killed in the line of duty though they have been injured. Still, law enforcement officers have to carry with them all of the stresses of their job. We take everyones problems home with us everyday and those stresses add up over the course of a career, Schey said. Thats why the alcoholism, divorce and suicide rates are so high amongst officers. When people stop and recognize the job we do with a simple thank you, it helps to rationalize an irrational world. While the Caledonia Police Department hasnt lost any officers during the course of duty, the following officers were killed while on duty while serving the Racine County Sheriffs Department: Deputy Sheriff Henry Denman Racine County Sheriffs Department EOW: Thursday, June 25, 1953 Cause: Vehicle pursuit Deputy Sheriff George W. Hansen Racine County Sheriffs Department EOW: Thursday, June 18, 1953 Cause: Vehicle pursuit Deputy Sheriff Arthur G. Herman Racine County Sheriffs Department EOW: Saturday, May 15, 1920 Cause: Motorcycle accident Because members of the Caledonia Police Department put their lives on the line every day, we put out a call on Facebook to give the community the opportunity to show their support for their men and women in blue. Heres what you had to say: Rosie Olle Thank you so much for all you do in supporting your local baseball / Softball league, All of us in Caledonia, we truly appreciate you. Thank you for keeping an eye on the park for us as well.... Thanks Ed Pestka and Terry Mayne. Chad Tremelling Thank you for your service to our community. Stay safe.",0
"Police arrested a man on hate crime charges Friday night in connection with a May harassment incident.

Police say 49-year-old Frederick Nolan Sorrell threatened a Muslim couple using words and hand gestures.

Bias crimes detectives investigated the incident, which led to an arrest warrant for the man.

Sorell faces three counts of intimidation in the second degree.

Court documents say he unlawfully, intentionally and because of his perception of the victims race, color, religion and national origin, caused alarm by threatening to inflict serious physical injury upon them.

Hes also accused of threatening to cause substantial damage to the victims property.

Sorell is no stranger to the law. Records show he was convicted of rape in Multnomah County in 2001.

Sorell was booked into the Multnomah County Jail where he awaits arraignment on Monday.",1
"(JTA) — The city council of a St. Louis suburb that had its Jewish cemetery vandalized is considering a resolution that would create a hate crimes registry.

The resolution was introduced Monday in the University City Council by Councilman Rod Jennings.

Jennings told the local media that he had been considering introducing such legislation since November, long before the attack on the Chesed Shel Emeth Cemetery in which 154 headstones were knocked over or damaged.

The resolution would create a hate crimes database similar to a sex offenders registry. Anyone convicted of a hate crime who moves into or out of University City would be in the database, which would accessible to the public.

“I think it is important that we know they are living close to our schools and our children, close to our resident and our homes, close to every mosque, synagogue and church,” Jennings told the St Louis Post-Dispatch. “We would want to know if someone who was a proven hate crime offender is in our community, and we would want our neighboring community to know they are leaving or community and moving into theirs.”

The council will vote on the measure at its regular meeting in two weeks on March 13.

Police still have not identified any suspects in the cemetery case, nor have they decided to label the attack as a hate crime.",1

"ATLANTA, GA -- A heartwarming story involving an Atlanta police officers good deed has led to a stream of people vowing to help a local family in need. Atlanta Police Officer Che Milton responded to a call about a 12-year-old girl being held in a Family Dollar for alleged shoplifting. The girl told Milton that although she couldnt afford to buy them, she wanted to bring a pair of $2 shoes to her 5-year-old sister, who desperately needed them. The exchange prompted Milton to look further into the girls home conditions were like, so he offered to give her a ride home. Officer Milton came to learn that the girl was the eldest child of four, with the youngest being a newborn. The mother told the officer that she didnt work because she couldnt afford day care; her husband frequently works out of town but for little pay. Inside the home, there was hardly any food, not enough beds for the kids and the only furniture was an old couch. Moved by the familys living conditions, Officer Milton reached out to the Georgia Division of Family and Children Services to see if a social work could assist. He also paid for and delivered four pizzas and two large drinks for the family. But it didnt stop there, the Atlanta Police Department sought to help the family further, so they have rallied around them. The call from the APD went out this week to donate items to assist them. On Facebook, APD said it would set up a donation drop-off. If you would like to donate items to support the family, please drop them off at the Zone 1 precinct located at 2315 Donald Lee Hollowell Pkwy NW, Atlanta, GA 30318. Donations will be accepted from 8 am – 6 pm, Monday - Friday. There has been an overwhelming response. An Atlanta family is getting the help it needs because of a stellar example of community policing. Officer Milton didnt publicize this incident nor was he looking for recognition from it, but another officer saw fit to share this story with Atlanta and the world -- and were all thankful for it.

"As soon as there is a tragedy in this country, Muslims are often the ones who get the brunt of the blame, even if they have nothing to do with it. It is not your job to apologize, because it is not your fault. And further, any real Muslim would know that nowhere in the Quran or Islam does it say to kill innocent people. However, it is okay to show your remorse and sadness. This is because ― like all Americans ― American Muslims mourn after any tragedy occurs, as we did after the recent shooting in Las Vegas and the Texas church massacre. We all mourn because the loss of innocent lives is something any sane person would mourn. American Muslims, this article will offer you some talking points that you can use in the aftermath of all national tragedies.

I had the pleasure to reach out to Hiba Rahim, the North-West Regional Coordinator for the Council On American and Islamic Relations in Florida (CAIR FL). CAIR FL is the state’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy group. They offer victims of discrimination free legal representation, regardless of their faith or ethnicity. Their focus and mission is to create mutual understanding and respect through dialogue, for all of society. Though Rahim is located in Panama City, FL, she oversees the Florida panhandle, which ranges from the Florida capital of Tallahassee all the way to Pensacola. She does outreach and presentations for/with the media, law enforcement, schools, universities and interfaith and civil rights groups, etc.

Last week, I sat in on a conference call led by Rahim. On the call, we reviewed talking points one that offered insightful information on what Muslims should say after a tragedy, if brought up in conversation. The conference call took place the day after the incident in Manhattan, on Halloween 2017.

After these types of tragedies, the majority of Muslims are the ones who are bearing much of the burden. These talking points will help you talk to people when the topic of national tragedy is broached.

Some talking points you could use are as follows:

We are upset and angered by the recent acts of mass violence. An attack on one American is an attack on all of us. We will not stand for violence against innocent people.

Few carry out acts of mass violence. We as a community of logical and intelligent individuals condemn all forms of violence in the most drastic way. When we see repetitious acts of mass violence ranging from Texas to Las Vegas to Manhattan, we must seek to create solutions that will have a lasting impact on our society.

There are leaders that will raise fear in hopes of dividing us. We are smarter than that. The events of Las Vegas and Charlottesville show all too well that violence doe not stem from one faith or political party - this is a tactic that weak individuals use to appear powerful, and to pronounce power where they have no power.

We, as people ― and our leaders ― have significant choices to make: we can play on our strengths or give into fear. America has always been it’s strongest when we stand together. Those Americans who would turn against each other or abandon our rights to free speech, free assembly, and freedom of religion would be throwing the greatest thing about America away. Those people will never succeed. As we look back at which our history taught us we renounce our principles with humiliation.

We must stop thinking with fear and be intelligent with how we will tackle the problem of mass violence. We should not blame an entire group of people because of their religion or their race.

"LONDON (AP) - A Scottish man who filmed a dog appearing to give Nazi salutes was fined 800 pounds ($1,200) on Monday after being convicted of a hate crime, in a case that has sparked a debate about the limits of free speech.

Mark Meechan filmed his girlfriends pug responding to phrases such as sieg heil by raising its paw and posted the footage on YouTube in 2016.

Meechan - a comedian and video blogger who uses the name Count Dankula - said the stunt was meant as a joke, but he was convicted last month of posting grossly offensive material.

A judge at Scotlands Airdrie Sheriff Court imposed the 800-pound fine Monday. Sheriff Derek OCarroll said the video contained menacing, anti-Semitic and racist material. The dog was filmed responding to the phrase gas the Jews, which was repeated 23 times in the video, OCarroll said.

The judge said that while the right to freedom of expression is very important, in all modern democratic countries the law necessarily places some limits on that right.

Outside court, Meechan, 30, said his conviction set a really dangerous precedent for free speech and he would appeal. His conviction drew expressions of concern from comedians such as Ricky Gervais. Several far-right commentators also championed Meechans position.

Meechan, who described the contents of his YouTube channel as offensive social commentary in an accent you wont understand, said Scottish authorities have ignored the context of the dog video.

Its the juxtaposition of having an adorable animal react to something vulgar that was the entire point of the joke, he said.",1

"ATLANTA, GA -- A Fulton County grand jury has indicted a 39-year-old Roswell man in the shooting death of an attorney for Sandy Springs-based UPS, who was on her way to work when she was killed in the middle of a Midtown Atlanta street. Raylon Browning was indicted this week on murder, felony murder, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon charges in the shooting death of Trinh Hong Huynh. He was also indicted on two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, possession of a knife during the commission of a felony, aggravated battery and simple battery for the alleged attack on two construction workers, the Fulton County District Attorneys Office said. Atlanta police responded to a call of a person shot around 7:40 a.m. April 3 where they found Huynh dead from a gunshot wound in the middle of a crossswalk at the intersection of Peachtree Street and Peachtree Place. Surveillance video from the scene of the crime helped police identify the shooter as Browning and later that day, he was arrested by Cobb County police after running a red light. During the traffic stop, Cobb police learned Browning also had an active arrest warrant for aggravated assault in connection to the stabbings that occurred a day before Huynh was gunned down. He was taken into custody and detectives were able to tie him to Huynhs death, the district attorneys office said. While housed at the Fulton County Jail, Browning allegedly attacked another inmate without provocation. He was transferred to the jails medical wing and was seen by another deputy biting into his left arm. Jail staff opted to transport Browning to Grady Memorial Hospital where he was treated.

"LOWER EAST SIDE, NY — A pedestrian was injured in an accident involving an MTA bus on Canal Street and Allen Street just before 3 p.m. on Friday, officials said. An FDNY spokesman said one person was seriously injured in the accident in which the accordion-style bus drove up on the sidewalk and hit a gate and bench. The injuries were not considered life-threatening, according to the FDNY. The person was taken to New York Downtown Hospital by paramedics. The bus remained on the scene until after 5 p.m. as investigators looked into the accident. The official did not know if anyone was on the bus besides the driver, but no one else was injured. The accident comes one day after Mayor Bill de Blasio announced his campaign to get drivers to take note of dusk conditions in an effort to avoid pedestrian deaths.

"LAWRENCEVILLE, GA — A 73-year-old Gwinnett County man has been convicted of repeatedly raping a teen relative of his over the course of several years. A Superior Court jury took two hours Thursday to convict Benjamin Daniels on charges of rape, aggravated child molestation, child molestation and incest. He is scheduled to be sentenced for his crimes on August 1. Evidence during Benjamins four-day trial showed that on Sept. 19, 2014, a sister of Benjamins then 15-year-old victim walked into a bedroom to discover Daniels — who was 70 at the time — on top of the victim in the act of sexual intercourse. The sister who saw the act reported it to administrators at South Gwinnett High School the following Monday. When approached by school administrators and Snellville Police, the victim said shed been molested by Daniels on and off for more than seven years at locations in Clayton, DeKalb and Gwinnett counties. She acknowledged she was being raped when her sister saw the act, but said she didnt say anything because she was used to it. She told police shed maintained her silence out of fear for what the information would have done to her family and out of physical fear of Daniels — who had previous served prison time for voluntary manslaughter, aggravated assault, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony and possession of a sawed-off shotgun. During his trial, Daniels maintained that he had never done anything sexually inappropriate to the victim, that he had rejected her sexual advances the day her sister saw them and, also, that he believes Georgias legal age for sexual consent should be lowered from 16 to 14. The August 1 sentencing day in the case, set by Judge Tom Davis, is meant to allow the victim and her family to testify regarding Daniels sentence. Photo via Gwinnett County Sheriffs Office",0

"You might say a Washington State Trooper always gets his bike. Last week, a state trooper spotted a bike he had recently sold on-line to a college student on Capitol Hill in Seattle -- inside a suspicious vehicle another trooper found partially blocking a road in Shoreline. The bike had, in fact, been stolen just days after the trooper sold it, and he subsequently confiscated it and returned it to the rightful owner. It all started on the morning of April 25, when a state trooper arrived at a disabled vehicle that was partially blocking State Route 523 (NE 145th) near 12th Avenue NE in Shoreline. According to Trooper Julie Judson, WSP spokeswoman, the driver, a 34-year-old Seattle man, was hurriedly attempting to change a tire on the car, a black Honda Accord. The trooper on the scene noticed a bicycle in the car with its serial numbers ground off, along with a grinder and a Ruger handgun, all clearly visible inside the car. Soon another trooper arrived to assist, and immediately recognized the bike by scratches on the frame. He had sold that bike just weeks earlier to the student. The driver merely claimed it was his bike. But the trooper called the student he had sold the bike to, who confirmed it had been stolen just days after he bought if from the trooper. The bike was later returned to the rightful owner. And the driver was booked into the King County Jail for investigation of being a felon in possession of a firearm.",0
"Updated at 11:39 a.m. to include a statement from The Intercept.

Updated at 1:28 p.m. to include comments by the Secure Community Network, the Southern Poverty Law Center and Larry Barton, and information from the Anti-Defamation League and the federal complaint.

Police have arrested a Missouri man named Juan Thompson for allegedly threatening Jewish community centers and the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), according to a complaint officials unsealed on Friday.

“Everyone deserves to be free from fear and discrimination based on religion, race or ethnicity,” U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara said in a statement. “That is fundamental to who we are as a nation.”

Related: 20 bomb threats follow Jewish cemetery desecration

Thompson, 31, is also accused of stalking a romantic interest. He allegedly made some of the threats in her name, officials said. The eight threats against Jewish community centers he allegedly made still account for only a small portion of those recently made to such institutions.

Thompson has written for The Intercept, a journalism website cofounded by Glenn Greenwald and Jeremy Scahill. Referring to Thompson, the editor-in-chief of The Intercept, Betsy Reed, said in February 2016 that the site had “discovered a pattern of deception in the actions of a staff member.” Reed said Thompson had fabricated quotes in articles and used fake email accounts to impersonate people, including the editor. Reed said Thompson’s employment had ended in January 2016. The Intercept released a statement regarding the arrest just before 11:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on Friday:

Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now

We were horrified to learn this morning that Juan Thompson, a former employee of The Intercept, has been arrested in connection with bomb threats against the ADL and multiple Jewish Community Centers in addition to cyberstalking. These actions are heinous and should be fully investigated and prosecuted. We have no information about the charges against Thompson other than what is included in the criminal complaint. Thompson worked for The Intercept from November 2014 to January 2016, when he was fired after we discovered that he had fabricated sources and quotes in his articles.

According to the federal complaint, Thompson allegedly made at least eight threats to Jewish institutions in January and February. The FBI believes these were part of an effort to stalk and harass a former romantic partner who had broken up with him last July. He allegedly made some of the threats in that woman’s name and others in his own name, in order to pretend that the woman was trying to frame him. (The complaint does not specify the gender of the former romantic partner, but on a Twitter account that appears to belong to Thompson, he referred to the person as a woman.)

In one anonymous email that Thompson allegedly sent in late February to the ADL, he named the woman and wrote that she “is behind the bomb threats against jews. She lives in nyc and is making more bomb threats tomorrow.” The next day, he allegedly called the ADL and, using a voice disguiser, said a C-4 explosive would go off “within one hour.” He also threatened Jewish centers in Dallas and San Diego, the complaint alleges. In several other anonymous threats, he allegedly mentioned his own name, saying “Juan Thompson” wants to cause a “Jewish newtown”—likely referring to the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

A February 24 tweet from an account that appears to belong to Thompson and cited in the complaint, said, “Know any good lawyers? Need to stop this nasty/racist #whitegirl I dated who sent a bomb threat in my name & wants me to be raped in jail.”

In addition to the threats, Thompson also allegedly falsely told the woman’s employer that she had a sexually transmitted disease and accused her of criminal activity. He also allegedly falsely reported her to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children for watching child pornography. That woman, which the criminal complaint said “works at a social service organization in the greater New York area,” secured an order of protection against him.

The ADL said on Friday that its Center on Extremism had previously monitored Thompson, including “his deceptive reports for a news website about Dylann Roof,” the white supremacist who killed nine people at a Charleston, South Carolina, church in 2015. Thompson had displayed a “hostility towards whites” and at least once referred to white police officers as “evil sociopaths,” according to the ADL. He also called former President Barack Obama a “rotten collaborating liberal” who “killed innocent [people of color]” and criticized “the white New York liberal media [that] makes me vomit with their arrogant, patronizing bigotry.” Thompson once ran for mayor of St. Louis, saying he wanted to undo the system of “racial supremacy and greedy capitalism that is stacked against us.”

Since the beginning of 2017, about 100 threats have been made against Jewish community centers (JCCs), Jewish schools and other Jewish institutions in the United States. Vandals have also struck Jewish cemeteries in Missouri, Pennsylvania and New York state, toppling hundreds of headstones.

On February 27, the ADL issued a “security advisory” to Jewish institutions because of the threats. That day, JCCs and Jewish schools received 31 bomb threats, according to the JCC Association of North America. The previous day, police and community members found headstones toppled at the Mount Carmel Cemetery in Philadelphia. A local rabbi and others who surveyed the cemetery counted 539 damaged plots. “People are pissed off,” Steven Rosenberg, chief marketing officer of the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia, previously told Newsweek. “They’ve had enough.”

Others Behind Threats Remain At Large

The suspected perpetrators of other recent anti-Semitic incidents remain at large. “I would not take comfort in the arrest of one individual, just given the volume of threats that have been received nationwide and the actual attacks on cemeteries,” says Larry Barton, a professor of crisis management and public safety at the University of Central Florida and an instructor at the FBI Academy and U.S. Marshals Service. “It’s a positive step, for sure,” he adds, “but the hate continues, the issues continue.”

The Secure Community Network, which provides security resources to Jewish organizations, and the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate and extremist organizations, also pointed out in tweets that Thompson is allegedly behind just a handful of the many recent threats.

Friday’s news is the first publicly announced arrest in what has been five waves of threats in 2017. Law enforcement sources had speculated that some of the threatening calls originated overseas, according to CNN. Another law enforcement source has said the calls “appear to be coordinated,” and are coming from both overseas and inside the U.S., CBS reported. The FBI has said it and the U.S. Department of Justice are investigating possible civil rights violations connected to the threats.

There have been other arrests and prosecutions for threats or attacks on Jewish institutions in the U.S. In 2015, a Kentucky man named Paul Apple appeared in court after allegedly leaving a threatening note on a JCC employee’s desk. In 2014, a gunman named Frazier Glenn Miller Jr. killed three at a Jewish community center in Kansas and a nearby Jewish assisted-living community, including a 14-year-old boy and his grandfather. He was convicted and sentenced to death. A 2009 shooting at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., left one dead. The suspect, James von Brunn, died while awaiting trial. In July 2006, a gunman named Naveed Afzal Haq killed one and injured five others at the Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle. He was convicted and sentenced to life without parole, plus 120 years. In 1999, Buford O. Furrow Jr., a white supremacist, opened fire at a Los Angeles JCC, injuring five, including three young children. Later that day, he murdered a mail carrier. He was sentenced to two life terms without parole, plus 110 years, and ordered to pay almost $700,000 in restitution.

President Donald Trump condemned the recent anti-Semitic acts during his address to a joint session of Congress on February 28: “Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week’s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a Nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms.” The shooting the president referred to involved the killing of an Indian national at a Kansas bar and the wounding of his coworker, who is also from India. The FBI has said it is investigating the incident as a hate crime.

Jewish community members had previously criticized Trump for a seeming unwillingness to condemn the anti-Semitic trend. On February 28, prior to the address to Congress, Trump said, “Sometimes it’s the reverse, to make people—or make others—look bad,” according to Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who recalled Trump’s remarks during an interview with Buzzfeed.",1

Black Man Arrested, Charged with ‘Hate Crime’ for Calling a Police Officer a ‘Nazi’ – Free Thought Project A Black man was charged with terroristic threats, resisting arrest and ethnic intimidation for calling a police officer a “Nazi” while he was being arrested.

Crafton, PA – In a complete misapplication of Pennsylvania’s hate crime statute called “ethnic intimidation”—defined by law as “malicious intention toward the race, color, religion or national origin of another individual or group of individuals”—Pennsylvania Police are using the law to criminalize constitutionally protected speech directed at them.

For example, Robbie Sanderson, a 52-year-old Black man from North Carolina, was arrested on Sept. 23, 2016, for retail theft in Crafton, Pennsylvania. During the course of his arrest, Sanderson allegedly called the officers “Nazis,” “skinheads” and “Gestapo,” according to court documents filed by the Crafton Borough police.

For the simple act of expressing his feelings about the officers, he was charged with a hate crime.





Let that sink in for a moment…

A Black man was charged with a hate crime for simply calling a cop a “Nazi.”

“This is completely ridiculous,” said Mary Catherine Roper, deputy legal director for the ACLU of Pennsylvania. “This is not what the hate crime statute was for. This is criminalizing pure speech and that violates the First Amendment.”

"A 17-year-old Muslim girl was assaulted and killed after leaving a Virginia mosque on Monday, in a murder case that isn’t being investigated as a hate crime, police said.

We are NOT investigating this murder as a hate crime. https://t.co/f6TegmdKMR pic.twitter.com/mlGzrQfiMk— Fairfax Co. Police (@fairfaxpolice) June 19, 2017

Darwin Martinez Torres, 22, was charged with murder in the death of Nabra Hassanen, who went missing after leaving the All Dulles Area Muslim Society in Reston, Virginia on Sunday morning.

Hassanen and a group of other teens had gotten out of early morning mosque services and were just leaving breakfast at a nearby IHOP when a motorist approached them aggressively, causing most of them to run back toward the mosque, The Washington Post reported.

When the teens arrived at the mosque, they reported that Hassanen was left behind.

Police searched for hours in an attempt to locate the missing girl, only to locate what appeared to be her remains at about 3 pm. They arrested Torres during the search after noticing him driving suspiciously and allegedly finding several items of evidence in his car, police said.

Hassanen’s mother, Sawsan Gazzar, reportedly told the Washington Post that Nabra was beaten with a metal bat. She believes her daughter was killed because of her religion.

“I think it had to do with the way she was dressed and the fact that she’s Muslim,” Gazzar said. “Why would you kill a kid? What did my daughter do to deserve this?”

Hassanen, who was not very religiously observant, did not normally wear traditional Muslim clothes, her mother said, but had borrowed an abaya from her mom to wear during Ramadan. During the month-long celebration of Ramadan, Muslims traditionally have big feasts after sundown followed by late night prayer services, often concluding with an early morning breakfast to prepare for a day of fasting from sunrise to sunset. This made the 24-hour IHOP near Hassanen’s mosque a popular destination for Muslim teens—Hassanen had safely eaten there with her friends during Ramadan just the year before, her mother said.

Police did not say why they are not investigating the murder as a hate crime in their intial tweet, but many on social media immediately questioned the decision.

“This is the question that I’ve gotten for the last four hours,” said Don Gotthardt, a public information officer for the Fairfax County Police, when Oxygen asked him why the his department specified that this was not being investigated as a hate crime. The intent of the tweet was to quell the public’s anxiety.”

We have no information to indicate that it was a hate crime, he added, but said that as the investigation uncovers more information about the suspects motives, police may still consider bringing hate crime charges against him.

"Updates from the Hillsborough County Sheriffs Office have been made to this story since it was originally published. Around 7 a.m., Amy Jo Akert heard the screams. Im gonna kill you! she heard someone say from across Orange Grove Drive in Countrywood Apartments. Outside, she saw a man burst in flames. I was thinking, Oh my gosh, how did he just start on fire? she said, standing outside the door of her apartment. It was crazy. The fire stemmed from a domestic dispute at 12401 Orange Grove Drive, unit 114, between an estranged husband and wife, said Larry McKinnon, spokesman for the Hillsborough County Sheriffs Office. According to McKinnon, Matthew Wong, 50, of 31512 Cross Creek Circle in Wesley Chapel, rented a Toyota Corolla that he drove to the apartment home of Gloria Davis. He waited for Davis, 47, to come out to the parking lot and head to work, McKinnon said. She comes out to to go to work, and he chases her with a bleach bottle with gasoline in it, he said. Wong splashes himself while chasing a screaming Davis. Neighbors hear her, and someone allows her to take refuge in their apartment, McKinnon said. When Davis disappears, Wong decides to set the unit on fire where she was hiding, McKinnon said, burning bushes and the entrance of the apartment building. Thats when he set himself on fire, his body wet from the gasoline that he splashed on himself while chasing Davis, McKinnon said. He fell to the ground burning when neighbors came out with a fire extinguisher and blankets, McKinnon said. Wong was taken to Tampa General Hospital, and is listed in critical condition, McKinnon said. Davis was not injured, he said. The couple had been married 25 years, and have been estranged since October. They have two adult children, McKinnon said. Detectives who searched Wongs rental car in the parking lot found black garbage bags taped to the back side windows, and a blanket taped to the back window, McKinnon said. Wong also had a two and a half gallon gas can, gloves and a roll of tape inside the car, McKinnon said. The investigation is ongoing.",0

"Police Investigating Possible Hate Crime Near Towson University

Baltimore County police are investigating a possible hate crime from last weekend.

The Baltimore Sun reported that two members of a Jewish fraternity were attacked by two suspects Sunday morning near campus. The students are members of the Alpha Epsilon Pi. They said the suspects, who the victims recognized as Towson students, started following them and shouted F the Jews, and then called them an ethnic slur.

According to the victims, one of them was then punched in the face and believes the assault was motivated by his religious beliefs.

Towson University does not tolerate acts of hatred, bias, racism or discrimination of any kind on our campus or by members of the TU community, Towson President Kim Schatzel said in an email to the university community. All reports of hate-bias are taken seriously and are thoroughly investigated. Any student found responsible for such conduct is subject to sanctions including suspension and expulsion from the university.

She said university officials have contacted the victims and are offering their full support.

The victims have up to a year to press assault charges against the suspects. The Sun reports police have identified the suspects, who have not yet been charged.

I am appalled that the off-campus incident occurred between members of our own community, and wish to provide my deepest assurances that these events will be treated with the utmost urgency by me and the Towson University administration, Schatzel wrote.

An official with the national fraternity told The Sun that there is no question the incident was a hate crime.",1
"FAIRFAX, VA — An Alexandria, Va. woman was convicted of murder Monday in the MS-13 gang-related stabbing of a 15-year-old from Gaithersburg. Venus Iraheta, 18, admitted to the brutal slaying of Damaris A. Reyes Rivas in Fairfax County Circuit Court Monday. Iraheta pleaded guilty to charges of first-degree murder, abduction and gang participation and faces a maximum of life in prison. Iraheta is one of ten MS-13 gang members charged in the death and is believed to be the ringleader in the killing. Reyes Rivas was killed in Lake Accotink Park in Springfield, Va. on Jan. 8, 2017, prosecutors said. Reyes Rivas was reported as a missing person in December and her body was found in February. She had previously told her mother gang members were threatening her. Reyes Rivas left her Gaithersburg home on Dec. 10, 2016 and was lured to the park, thinking she was going to smoke marijuana, but found gang members waiting who immediately began interrogating her about the death of Christian Sosa Rivas, Irahetas ex-boyfriend, prosecutors said. The body of Sosa Rivas, 21, was found in Dumfries, Va. in January. The group accused her of luring Sosa Rivas to a park in Dumfries where he was slain around New Years Eve. The group wanted revenge against Reyes Rivas and questioned her about his death. An FBI special agent who questioned Iraheta said the group wanted Reyes Rivas to feel as much pain as Christian, according to NBC Washington. She told the victim she would never forgive her, said FBI Agent Fernando Uribe. She would see her in hell. She would never forget her name. See Related: Reyes Rivas was taken to another park, beaten, and then stabbed 13 times, prosecutors say. The group reportedly threatened to cut off her fingers and set her on fire before they killed her as she stood freezing in the cold. Her killers recorded her last minutes on cell phone videos. According to Fairfax County Police the four adults charged in the girls death are: Six teenagers were also been charged with abduction and gang participation, police said. Iraheta, who was 17 at the time of the murder, faces life in prison plus 20 years and will be sentenced May 25.

"The man who believes racism no longer exists was just slapped with a hate crime lawsuit. A white Hollywood security is suing Lil Wayne and alleging the rapper assaulted him because of his “Caucasian ancestry and descent.”

Andrew Nunemacher was a bouncer at Hyde Sunset nightclub in LA on June 27, 2016 at the BET Music Awards after party. He claims, while doing his job monitoring the flow of traffic entering the club, Wayne and his crew became angry and rowdy because he didn’t allow some of Wayne’s entourage in the club.

According to the bouncer, Wayne punched him with a closed fist and knocked him to the ground. He also claims the rapper threw a glass filled with alcohol in his face.

Nunemacher believes the incident was partially racially motivated because Wayne allegedly said, “F*ck you, white boy” during the assault. According to Variety, Nunemacher used California’s Unruh Civil Rights Act and the Ralph Civil Rights Act to file the hate crime lawsuit.

Citing assault, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, the bouncer is seeking $25,000 in damages.

Nunemacher is also suing Young Money Entertainment, Universal Music Group, SBE Entertainment (which owns Hyde), and the company that promoted the BET Music Awards after party, Made Hollywood Inc.

The rapper’s reps denies he had any involvement in the incident.

Wayne facing a hate crime allegation is ironic because he has claimed that racism no longer exists because his concert audiences are predominantly white and claims he’s never personally experienced racism. He also received backlash for not supporting the Black Lives Matter movement.",1
"Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Wednesday that the Charlottesville car attack could be prosecuted as a hate crime, saying that federal authorities intensely probing the case could ultimately decide to prosecute the driver in a number of different ways.

Sesssions cautioned that no federal charges were imminent as officials are still conducting an ongoing investigation into the deadly attack that killed one woman Saturday and injured 19 others.

It doesnt have to be done immediately, he told NBC News in an interview. We will be working with the state to see how they will proceed with their charges. We could bring charges whenever the investigation justifies them. But I dont think we should just feel like weve got to do it in a matter of hours or days.

Local authorities have charged James Alex Fields Jr., 20, with second-degree murder, hit-and-run and three counts of malicious wounding. He is being held in a Charlottesville jail about two miles from the site where police say he crashed his car into a group protesting white supremacists and neo-Nazis who had gathered in Charlottesville.

Sessionss comments characterizing the attack as a potential hate crime, during which he again stressed how seriously the Justice Department takes what happened, came as President Donald Trump has drawn intense criticism for his reaction to the Charlottesville violence.

During a remarkable news conference Tuesday in New York, Trump - who had at first declined to condemn hate groups by name, then did so after blowback - defiantly reiterated his belief that both sides were to blame for the bloodshed. He also defended some of the marchers who descended on Charlottesville.

A day after Sessions said the Charlottesville car attack meets the federal definition of domestic terrorism, Trump on Tuesday pilloried the suspected driver but declined to call the attack terrorism when asked by a reporter.

I think the driver of the car is a disgrace to himself, his family and this country, Trump said. You can call it terrorism. You can call it murder. You can call it whatever you want. I would just call it as the fastest one to come up with a good verdict. There is a question. Is it murder? Is it terrorism? Then you get into legal semantics. The driver of the car is a murderer. What he did was a horrible, horrible, inexcusable thing.

Sessionss comments labeling the Charlottesville incident terrorism echoed the way a number of lawmakers and citizens have characterized the car attack, but they did not immediately suggest what kind of federal prosecution could follow. There is no specific federal criminal charge for domestic terrorism, so authorities seeking to prosecute Fields in federal court would need to charge him with another crime.

Experts have said that the attack might straddle the line between terrorism and a hate crime and could ultimately be viewed as both. Former federal prosecutors said that a possible hate crime prosecution would depend on whether Fields was specifically targeting someone in a group covered by the hate-crime statute.

If youre a racist and you kill someone, that doesnt mean its a hate crime, said Timothy J. Heaphy, a former U.S. attorney in the Western District of Virginia, which encompasses Charlottesville. There has to be an explicit connection between the two for it to be a civil rights offense.

Heaphy, who lives in Charlottesville, said that federal and local authorities will coordinate as they pore through Fieldss history and social media accounts and speak with people that know him in an effort to uncover whether there was anything directly linking the car attack to a hateful ideology.

The question is, is there a connection between the odious views that this person evidently has and his action at that time? Heaphy said.

Federal officials, who launched a civil rights investigation Saturday, have approached the incident as both an act of terror and a civil rights case. The Justice Department said it dispatched FBI counterterrorism agents and counterterrorism prosecutors Saturday. Sessions also said Wednesday that federal authorities could ultimately opt to prosecute a civil rights violation, a hate crime or unspecified other charges in the case.

We are working it intensely on the assumption that we may well want to prosecute it under one of those theories or whatever theory that we would find, he told NBC. Were also working with the state and local authorities who clearly have jurisdiction too, and often theyre the ones that have the best charge.

In some other cases, federal authorities followed local charges with their own. This happened in two high-profile situations in South Carolina recently. After the Charleston church massacre in 2015, local authorities charged the attacker, Dylann Roof, with murder. The Justice Department later indicted him on federal hate crime charges. Similarly, after Michael Slager - a former North Charleston police officer - was charged locally with murder for shooting a man fleeing a traffic stop, a federal civil rights charge was filed against him.

In both cases, the federal charges proved key. Roof was found guilty in his federal trial and sentenced to death, so he pleaded guilty to the state charges to avoid a second death-penalty trial. A mistrial was declared in Slagers trial, and though local prosecutors pledged to try him again, the local and federal cases were both resolved in May when the former officer pleaded guilty to the federal civil rights charge.

Sessions said that whatever authorities decide to do in Charlottesville, you can be sure itll be fully investigated and thoroughly prosecuted.",1
"police-fire

ARCADE—Four people are facing hate crime charges after a weekend vandalism spree in Arcade. Three of the four men charged are from Springville. Vehicles and other property were spray painted with racial slurs and at least one swastika, according to the Arcade Police Department.

Damien R. Brown, 20, of North Collins, two 16-year-olds and one 17-year-old of Springville, were arraigned July 2. The individuals were charged with criminal mischief in the fourth degree: a felony hate crime, disorderly conduct and conspiracy in the fifth degree.

“The Arcade PD called me [July 1],” Justin Haggerty, a Maple Street resident whose vehicle was tagged, said. “I was upset at first, but I brushed off what was going on and found a way for the paint to be taken off and [decided to] let the justice system run its course.”

The Arcade Police Department’s investigation revealed nine vehicles, one boat, two bridges and a couple stop signs in the Village had all been tagged with graffiti. Reportedly, there was also damage in the Town of Yorkshire.

The APD was able to identify the suspects and interviewed them accordingly. During the interview, police discovered the suspects were responsible for the vandalism in Arcade as well as in multiple towns stemming from a few months back.

“It was learned [the suspects] were responsible for vandalism in the Town of Orchard Park and in the Town of Sardinia,” a press release from the APD said. “In the Town of Sardinia, the Town Park was vandalized approximately a month ago.”

Brown was remanded to Wyoming County Jail, in Warsaw, in lieu of $1,500 cash or $3,000 bail bond. The three Springville teens were arraigned in Arcade Justice Court and released on their own recognizance to the care of their parents. They are all to appear in court at a later date.

“There is no need for me to remain upset about the situation,” Haggerty said. “I am disappointed to know those kids have gone down the wrong path. But, society is not perfect. Arcade PD has done an amazing job with finding the suspects, [I] couldn’t ask for a better group of officers in the Village.”",1
"OCEANSIDE, CA – The Red Cross is helping four people displaced by a Christmas Day mudslide that hit an apartment complex, a city official said. No one was injured, according to Greg DeAvila, on-duty battalion chief for the Oceanside Fire Department. He added a crew remains on scene to determine the source of water that caused the slide and to help clean up. A broken water line, along with the rain that fell on the North County on Saturday, caused the slide, DeAvila said. The fire department responded to 509 Canyon Drive at 5 a.m. Sunday regarding water coming through the wall downstairs in the four-unit, two-story complex. When fire and police units arrived, they discovered a 75-feet-long, 12-feet-wide mudslide behind the building. Mud pushed through the lower units, damaging the structure and appliances, said Pete Lawrence, Oceanside battalion chief. Lawrence said the Red Cross is helping displaced residents with temporary housing. The apartment property management company will help in securing long-term accommodations for the residents, who will have to live elsewhere for an extended period of time, Lawrence said. An official from the citys Building Department deemed the apartment complex unsafe, Lawrence said. He added that city officials also tagged a residence above the complex on Maxon Street for limited occupancy until a geologist can evaluate the slope. Residents in that house did not need assistance from the Red Cross, Lawrence said. The citys Water Utilities Department evaluated all water lines in the immediate area for any leaks or damage and found none, Lawrence said.

"The International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) and the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law are launching a new effort to deal with hate crimes. The groups are forming an advisory committee to “lead a discussion about ways to break down barriers and strengthen the relationship between law enforcement and communities that too often are the targets of hate crimes.” IACP president Donald De Lucca, police chief in Doral, Fl., says the project aims both to prevent and respond effectively to hate crimes.

Kristen Clarke of the Lawyers’ Committee said, “The tragic events in Charlottesville, Virginia serve as a chilling reminder that too many communities are the targets of hate-fueled acts.” The advisory committee will hold its first meeting on Sept. 19. It will focus on incidents that are motivated by actual or perceived race, national origin, religious background, gender identity, sexual orientation, and disability of any person.",1
"The Barrington Town Council ratified three union contracts on Monday evening, Oct. 1, that will save taxpayers millions of dollars down the road. The votes were all unanimous, 5-0. The millions of dollars in future savings will come in a give back by the police and fire departments of other post-employee benefits (OPEB) -- medical insurance after retirement, in Barringtons case -- for new officers, firefighters and dispatchers. That liability was in the same breath as pension reform, said Town Manager Peter DeAngelis Jr., who negotiated the new contracts. We stopped the liability for all new employees. OPEBs will continue to place unsustainable fiscal demand on communities, DeAngelis said. Its a good deal for the taxpayers, he said. The OPEB give back is a big one. We are now ahead of the game, DeAngelis said. I dont think any other town in the state doesnt have an OPEB. DeAngelis said he got the opportunity to bring up the OPEB because of four vacancies in the fire department. Those positions would probably have been filled if he had waited to negotiate the contracts later. The new contracts are all for three years. They will go into effect next July 1. The unions now will have minimum staffing levels written into the new contracts, DeAngelis said, although both the police chief and fire chief are already maintaining those levels. The minimum staffing level in the fire department during the day is 4; it will rise to 5, although Fire Chief Gerald Bessett has been maintaining a minimum of 5 already, said DeAngelis. The minimum staffing level in the police department is 3 during the day and 4 at night and on weekends, DeAngelis said. Police Chief John LaCross has been operating with those levels since 2009. Wage increases for the police and fire unions will be 2 percent each year. And the police will receive new language relating to detail pay, DeAngelis said. The towns six dispatchers, who handle police and fire calls, will get 2.5 percent and 2 percent raises in the first two years and no increase in the third year. OPEB is already out of the contract for the public works union, DeAngelis said.",0

"Four Men Convicted After Using Popular Gay Social App in Violent Hate Crime Scheme

A total of four men have been sentenced to multiple years in prison after being caught using the gay dating app Grindr in a hate crime scheme.

The Daily Beast reported that the last of the four perpetrators, all of whom are between 19 and 21, were sentenced Monday after committing a series of early 2017 hate crimes in north Texas. Anthony Shelton and Cameron Ajiduah, ages 20 and 19, “were sentenced to 20 and 15 years in prison, respectively,” the report noted, and joined the previous sentencing of 15 and 10 years of their co-conspirators, Nigel Garrett (age 21) and Chancler Enclade (age 20).

“For each of the four home invasions,” the Justice Department wrote in a press release, “the defendants used Grindr, a social media dating platform for gay men, to falsely identify as a gay man and arrange to meet the victim at the victim’s home.”

“Upon entering the victim’s home, the defendants assaulted the victim, restrained the victim with tape, and made derogatory statements about the victim being gay,” the DOJ statement continued. “The defendants possessed a firearm during each home invasion, and they stole the victim’s property, including his motor vehicle.”

As U.S. Attorney Joseph D. Brown for the Eastern District of Texas said in the statement, the case “highlights the danger of the internet and specifically, online apps.”",1

Police say they havent ruled out hate crime charges, but do not yet have any evidence to believe Hassanen was targeted due to her religion.

Almost 1,000 people gathered at a local park in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday to pay tribute to the teen with flowers, signs, and one central message: Say her name. Small flower pots were available for passersby to arrange, as was a pen to write down thoughts and wishes for the slain 17-year-old girl. I can not forget her.

Among the multitudes who showed up to remember Nabra, was John Chadwell who believed it was important he came to support the people who feel threatened.

And it wasnt just Muslim youth but the broader Reston community that she was connected to, he said.

In fact, violence and hostility towards Muslim-Americans has become all too common.

Police said Torres beat her with a baseball bat after chasing a group of teenagers he encountered in the road on Sunday.

Lamia Sarver of McLean, Va., told the AP her own daughter is the same age as Hassanen. According to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, hate crimes like these have risen 20 percent in the past year. Its racism. Getting killed because shes Muslim. This teenage girl, Mehter said, had lived the horrific reality of the many incidents Muslim girls and women face.

Police stressed that the incident does not appear to be motivated by bias.

That is the highest number since 2001, when the al Qaeda attacks on NY and elsewhere drove the number to its highest ever level, 481 hate crimes, according to Mark Potok with the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Michelle Salehi, 17, stood outside the ADAMS Center Wednesday before Hassanens funeral.

A Washington, D.C., memorial for Hassanen was set on fire Wednesday.

Later Wednesday evening, after Hassanens burial, a crowd of several thousand gathered at a plaza few blocks from her home for a vigil. Many said they were only starting to wrap their heads around what had happened - but for all of them, it felt personal.

He said he sought to comfort the victims mother by telling her that a person who dies is such a manner will enter paradise, with not any question asked.

It seems like theyre sugar-coating it, said Ajha, a 21-year-old student who. She went with a group of friends from the mosque to get food, said Kashif Osman, with The Light House Project. It could have been me, said Yasmin Ali.

She was innocent, he said.

"ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — A White man was indicted Tuesday on a hate crime charge for allegedly stabbing a Black college student to death “because of his race,” a Maryland prosecutor said.

Prince George’s County State’s Attorney Angela Alsobrooks announced the grand jury indictment against Sean Urbanski at a news conference in Upper Marlboro, Maryland. Richard Collins III was stabbed to death on May 20 at the University of Maryland, days before he was set to graduate from Bowie State University. He had just been commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army.

“We are completely comfortable with the indictment in this case and look forward to taking the case to trial in January,” Alsobrooks said, adding that prosecutors took the time they felt was necessary to investigate all the evidence.

Authorities analyzed “lots and lots of digital evidence,” including evidence from Urbanski’s phone and computer data, Alsobrooks said.

“There was lots of digital evidence that we could look at to get a sense for the motive in this case,” Alsobrooks said, though she declined to elaborate.

“Again, we can’t discuss in detail without compromising our case what the evidence is in the case, but again the evidence led us to the conclusion that Lt. Collins was murdered because of his race,” Alsobrooks added, when reporters asked for further details.

Hassan Murphy, an attorney representing the Collins family, commended the decision to bring the hate crime charge.

“The Collins family calls on the University of Maryland, the University Police, the State Police, the Attorney General, and the Governor to do what is necessary to protect students of color at its institutions and to make them truly safe for all so that no family has to suffer as they have,” Murphy said in a statement.

Collins, 23, was visiting friends at the College Park campus of the University of Maryland when the stabbing happened.

Authorities quickly focused on the possibility that the slaying was a hate crime, because Urbanski became a member of a racist Facebook group several months before the stabbing. University of Maryland Police Chief said at the time he asked the FBI to assist in the investigation after learning Urbanski belonged to a Facebook group called “Alt-Reich: Nation,” where members post disparaging material about African-Americans and others.

Officials said Collins was with two friends near a campus bus stop about 3 a.m. when they heard Urbanski screaming and watched him approach them. Urbanski said “Step left, step left if you know what’s best for you,” according to the charging documents. Collins said “no” before Urbanski stabbed him once in the chest, the documents said.

The killing roiled both campuses, which are near each other in suburban Washington. Bowie State is a historically black school. The case increased racial tensions at the flagship campus of Maryland’s university system, and the university announced new initiatives to improve how it investigates hate-based incidents.

“The Collins family remains in our thoughts, following their tragic loss last May,” the University of Maryland said in a statement. “This is especially true today as the prosecution of this senseless crime moves through the criminal justice system.”

Urbanski, 22, has been held on a murder charge since the stabbing. The former University of Maryland student faces up to life without parole, plus 20 years for the charge of a hate crime resulting in death, Alsobrooks said.

William Brennan, Urbanski’s attorney, did not immediately return a call seeking comment.",1
"Jun 21, 2017 10:54 AM Jun 21, 2017 10:54 AM

A 23-year-old Hispanic man told Southampton Town Police that four white men jumped him in Hampton Bays on Sunday night, beat him up while shouting anti-Hispanic comments at him, according to police.



Town Police are investigating the attack as a possible hate crime in cooperation with the Suffolk County Police Hate Crimes Unit and Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas Spota’s office.



Police said the victim, who lives in Hampton Bays, said he was walking on Atlantic Avenue near an alley, Pine Street, at 8:40 p.m. on Sunday when the four men, described by police as white men in their 20s, jumped out of a vehicle and began striking him and kicking him in the face. The victim told police the men left the scene in the same vehicle.



The victim was taken to Southampton Hospital, where he was treated for his injuries and released, police said.



On Tuesday, Minerva Perez, the executive director of the Organización Latino-Americana of Eastern Long Island, condemned the attack but said she is thankful that Town Police and other agencies say they are committed to finding the perpetrators who assaulted the young man.



“We are very encouraged by how quickly the police department in Southampton and [Chief Steven Skrynecki] immediately just looked at the facts and information they had, and determined to look at it as a hate crime,” Ms. Perez said. “How quickly they acted is an important message for the perpetrators.”



She said she was able to meet with the victim on Monday, as well as a few of his family members. She said she saw bruises on his face, forehead and nose. He also had a huge bump on his head.



“I saw a shaken, shocked and fearful young man,” Ms. Perez said. “He’s fearful, because the children who live in the house he lives in are fearful—they are petrified. He just wants his family to feel safe.”



Chief Skrynecki called the incident “a serious crime” and said they are asking for the public’s help in identifying the suspects. “If anyone has information about this case, or any similar instances occurring in the area, please give us a call,” he said, adding, “All calls will remain anonymous.”



Police ask that anyone with information about the incident call Southampton Town Police at 631-702-2230 or Suffolk County Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS.



Police did not provide a description of the vehicle or a further description of the alleged attackers, saying the release of those details could adversely affect the investigation. “We’re still trying to get a good handle on that vehicle,” Chief Skrynecki added.



In a press release from OLA, officials with the organization expressed condemnation of “these hateful and ethnically charged acts against a Latino member” of their Hampton Bays community.



“While OLA is horrified that a crime of this nature would happen, we are not surprised that such acts of violence could occur, as immigrants have been further vilified and scapegoated by those with an interest in creating fear and division,” OLA officials said in the release. “Our community must not cave to further violence.”



The organization called for “continued dialogue and transparency” focusing on the fears of the immigrant community, saying that, regardless of immigration status, the goal is to ensure “that all among us are safe and equally inclined to seek protections as victims and witnesses to crime.”",1
"- Joseph Messina woke up Wednesday morning, February 21, and came outside his South Philly home to find graffiti spray painted across the whole front wall.

“I feel really shocked and scared,” 12-year-old Joseph told FOX 29, “I’m just shocked that they know our address and that they did that.”

“I heard him scream. I didn’t know what happened,” said Margaux Messina, Joseph’s mother.

Margaux Messina quickly came outside. When she stepped out the front door, she saw the words “Snitchin and Die,” then a racial slur.

“To write the word die, that’s really, like, taking it far. It wasn’t just a racial comment. It was die,” Messina said.

Joe Messina believes the graffiti is tied to bullying incidents directed at his son. Joseph is a 7th grader at the Mastery Charter School, Thomas Campus in South Philly, which has a strict police against bullying.

“We’re trying to get him into another school and he was an honor roll student and his grades are starting to drop cause it’s consistent bullying,” Joe Messina said.

South Detectives and Homeland Security are now investigating the incident as a possible hate crime. Police are also stationed at the school to prevent further incidents. City cleanup crews removed the graffiti on the Messina’s home.

“God forbid if they retaliate and start shooting at our house. We’re really concerned about that,” Messina said.

“I really hope that they lock them up. I really do,” Margaux said.

“It’s like immature to do that to a person’s house over an incident with kids,” Joseph added.

Joseph is not going to return to school at this point. FOX 29 is awaiting a statement from the school.

"GULFPORT, FL -- Friday the 13th lived up to its reputation for a 64-year-old Gulfport woman who drove her sports utility vehicle over a seawall and into a Boca Ciega Bay canal. Around 2 p.m., Friday, April 13, Gulfport Police were called to 49th Street South and 31st Avenue South for a report of a vehicle in the water. According to police, the driver of the silver 2004 Toyota Highlander most likely experienced a medical problem that cause her to lose control of her SUV. Police say she was traveling at a high rate of speed on 49th Street South, which dead ends at the water with a seawall in between. The SUV left the road, went over the seawall and came to rest about 50 feet into the bay. Fortunately, the tide was out and the water was only about 3 feet deep. A nearby resident who witnessed the accident helped the woman out of the SUV. She was transported to Bayfront Medical Center for an evaluation and treatment for minor injuries. It took workers about two hours to remove the SUV from the water. Image via Google Earth",0

"Police took a 20-year-old West Des Moines woman into custody after she reportedly scaled the wall of her apartment complex to reach her balcony and, after failing to gain entry, woke other residents as she attempted to break down the door in the early morning hours of March 30. West Des Moines Police Officer Aaron Swenson responded to a disturbance call in the 4900 block of Woodland Drive about 2:45 a.m. When he got there, the woman – who was later charged with public intoxication and taken to the Polk County Jail – was attempting to break down her apartment door with a chair. She reportedly told Swenson that it was her apartment, and she and her two friends were locked out. She thought her roommate was sleeping inside, but loud knocking reportedly failed to rouse her. Swenson wrote in his report that he repeatedly tried to quiet the woman, but she walked away about three times, stating This is ridiculous.  Given the choice of being quiet or going to jail, the woman turned around and put her hands behind her back, Swenson wrote, apparently presenting herself to be handcuffed. She was arrested and as Swenson and a reserve officer working with him that morning escorted her down the stairs, she reportedly began resisting and said that she had changed her mind and did not want to go to jail. I advised her to keep walking, but she would not listen, Swenson said. She continued to plead to not be arrested. Swenson wrote in his report that en route to the jail, the woman apologized for not listening to him and then fell asleep for the remainder of the trip.

"Washington — WASHINGTON -- You could hear the screams and cheers from blocks away.

On Saturday, D.C. hosted the 2018 Pride Parade. There were tons of smiles and tons of reasons for why people showed-up to the celebration on Saturday.

Alejandra Powell said she made a four hour drive from southern Virginia to show support for her family.

“They’re the same people as just normal, straight people like me and they deserve the same respect as I do,” said Powell.

Nailah Hunter of Maryland says she came to mark her own coming out.

“We all need this inclusively. We need to celebrate everyone, we’re all human,” Hunter added.

Many came to share the love, but most importantly – we’re told they came to send a message.

“The reality is that we need to show the show of unity -- to show that we care and that we are not going away and that we are going to resist. This is as much a parade as it is a protest,” said Cathy Renna with the DC’s Capital Pride Alliance.

Renna is a long-time DC-area resident who’s been paying close attention to what’s been going on in the Nation’s Capital.

This includes unsolved April attack two gay men. It happened along the very busy, U St. corridor.

RELATED: DC Police release video of possible hate crime: homophobic slurs heard

Hate Crimes have been on the rise in DC. DC Police stats recorded 179 last year when the District only saw 66-biased incidents in 2015.

Most of the bias incidents appear to be over sexual orientation.

Last April, after the violent U St. attack, Chief Peter Newsham made a point to say most of the hate crime incidents have been against property.

Renna tells WUSA9, “Hate crimes have spiked since the Presidential campaign and it’s not just LGBT people; It’s all people, women, people of color, people of color, people of different religions. So the reality is we need to show a show of unity.”

To drive home the message of equality, the Capital Pride Alliance named Judy & Dennis Shepard as the Grand Marshals of this year’s parade. The couple lost their son 20 years ago. Matthew Shepard was reportedly abducted, tortured and murdered in Wyoming because of his sexual orientation.

"Attorney Greg Schweizer has been busy over the past 18 months.

After finishing a clerkship with Judge Cheryl Krause on the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in mid-2016, he moved to Chicago, got a puppy, started work as a litigation associate at Eimer Stahl, and married his now-husband, Jordan Rice. Yet with all these goings-on, Greg still managed to dive deep into pro bono work with Chicago Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights, co-counseling two cases with our Hate Crime Project. For that commitment to social justice, coming so early in his legal career, we recognize Greg Schweizer as our outstanding volunteer this quarter.



Greg insists that he’s not unusual—that many young associates are contributing their time and talent to pro bono matters. Still, his willingness to take on extra work in a new area is remarkable, particularly as many of his peers are just trying to keep their heads above water. Greg learned about the work of Chicago Lawyers’ Committee from Lisa Meyer, partner at Eimer Stahl and current Board Chair. Greg says that all the firm’s partners have been “completely supportive” of the hours and resources he has spent assisting clients of our Hate Crime Project.

In early 2017, Greg represented a gay man who was harassed and assaulted by his neighbors because of his sexual orientation.

Greg met with the client, conducted witness interviews, and worked with the Assistant State’s Attorney to prepare the client to testify in the resulting hate crime case. Greg counseled the client throughout the course of an emotional bench trial that resulted in a misdemeanor conviction. The case taught Greg how hard it can be to get the criminal justice system to take hate crime charges seriously, and how educating police officers, prosecutors, and the court about the contours of both the law and the realities of discrimination is critical to the effective enforcement of hate crime laws.



Challenges notwithstanding, Greg signed up for another hate crime case immediately after finishing his first. He supported his second client—a Latina woman attacked because of her heritage by a White woman—through the criminal court case in the fall of 2017. Greg is now representing the victim in a civil action against her attacker. He has once again contributed numerous hours on client meetings, witness preparation, research and pleadings.

Why get involved?

On a practical level, Greg says he’s developed new skills and had in-depth client interactions that are not typical for a young associate doing complex commercial litigation. On a deeper level, he believes that lawyers have a responsibility to provide public service and use their training for good. When he heard news about the dramatic increase in hate crime during 2016, he knew he had to help. And, as a gay man, Greg realizes how members of the LGBTQ community have often endured harassment, hatred and violence. He has friends who have been ostracized simply for expressing who they are. Standing up against such bigotry, Greg says, is how the legal system shows its value, policing norms of civilized society and protecting the most vulnerable among us.



We are grateful to have Greg’s energy, enthusiasm and intellect on our team at Chicago Lawyers’ Committee.",1
"SALEM, MA—A Salem woman had her leg crushed by a trash compactor after she fell down a garbage chute while trying to retrieve a pair of keys for $20, Salem Police Capt. Conrad Prosniewski confirmed. The unidentified woman, who is 38, is expected to survive, but has reportedly suffered a severe leg injury. Emergency personnel were called to Loring Towers at around 5:05 a.m. Monday morning for reports of a woman who fell down a trash chute. According to police reports, the mans keys had fallen down the chute when he threw a bag away. The man then went up to the womans apartment and offered her $20 to help retrieve his keys. The man first tried to lower the woman down the chute by holding her feet and dipping her head-first, according to the report. The second attempt involved tying a sheet to the woman, but it ripped and she fell three stories, where the trash compactor later turned on causing the injury. Prosniewski also told Patch that no criminal charges are currently being filed. Joe Lipovich, Patch Staff contributed to this report.",0

"by Alex Madison

The San Francisco Police Department said this week that it is investigating an alleged attack against a local drag queen as a possible hate crime, according to SFPD spokesman Officer Robert Rueca.

Ginger Snap, also known as Tim Tait, 40, said he was attacked Saturday, June 9, after leaving the Eagle Tavern. He posted graphic images of his injuries on Facebook last Thursday, which included two black eyes, a gash on his forehead, a broken front tooth, and other cuts and bruises. He filed a police report Monday, June 18, a little more than a week after the alleged incident.

The Bay Area Reporter spoke with Tait, who recalled the alleged attack. He said he was attending an event for the SF Knockers, a gay softball team, at SOMArts on Brannan Street, before heading to the Eagle Tavern, a gay bar in the South of Market neighborhood, around 9:45 p.m. He stayed at the Eagle for about 15 minutes and then decided to walk to his apartment a few blocks away. Instead of taking his normal route under the freeway, which is lit, he turned down Bernice Street, which he described as a small alleyway.

For some reason I made the unconscious decision to go down the alleyway, said Tait, who is gay.

At the time, he was not dressed in drag. He was wearing jeans and a white and fuchsia T-shirt and baseball hat, both with the teams name on them. Tait also mentioned he had a few drinks that night, but was not wasted.

Once walking on Bernice, Tait said he didnt see anyone and was suddenly hit from behind in the back of the head. Everything after the initial hit was fuzzy, Tait said, but he has had flashbacks of getting punched in between the eyes, giving him two black eyes, being dragged down the street, kicked, and punched.

After the attack, he walked home and saw himself in the mirror.

I was so flabbergasted. I was in shock. I didnt know how bad it was until I looked in the mirror, he said.

It was then that he called 911 and was transported to St. Marys Medical Center where he received an EKG and a CAT scan that showed he suffered a concussion. He said he didnt file a police report right away because he was waiting to gather more details, as well as recuperating.

SFPD confirmed the case number of Taits police report. Tait said that officers are investigating the incident and searching for security cameras that may have captured the incident, though, Rueca would not confirm that information.

On Facebook, people have show sympathy and support. However, one person called Tait out for the rumors that were going around that Taits injuries were the result of him falling in the bathroom, not an attack.

Hornet.com published a story about the incident and a user named anonimodesf left a comment June 17, rumors are buzzing that ginger texted friends saying she fell in the bathroom but was so drunk doesnt remember what happened and even mentioned falling in their bathroom. The most glaring (lack of detail) is no police report has been filed. I hope the rumors are false.

Tait responded to this by explaining that when he came home right after the attack, he had bled all over the bathroom. After coming home from the hospital, he still had not pieced together what happened. He texted a few friends about what could have possibly happened, including falling in the bathroom.

I understand why people questioned it because I did say that, but if they could see the state of my body and see what I went through now, it was obviously not a fall.

I dont want this to spread hate, he said. I want this to bring the community closer together, make us stronger, and be there for each other.

A GoFundMe has been set up for Taits medical costs at https://www.gofundme.com/put-the-smile-back-on-gingersnap, where almost $7,000 has been raised. Tait said he does not have medical insurance.

"Justice was served in the murder case of Mercedes Williamson, a transgender woman who was killed by a former boyfriend. Joshua Vallum had murdered Williamson, then only 17, in 2015, and on Monday, he was sentenced to 49 years in prison. This marks the first time a person in the United States has been sentenced with a hate crime against a transgender person.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions released a statement in support of the verdict. “Today’s sentencing reflects the importance of holding individuals accountable when they commit violent acts against transgender individuals,” it reads. “The Justice Department will continue its efforts to vindicate the rights of those individuals who are affected by bias motivated crimes.”

Though the news of Vallums sentence can be seen as a hopeful sign for the future of transgender rights, some advocates have commented that this case only highlights how far the United States still has to go. Mississippi and 19 other states do not include sexual orientation or gender identity as qualifiers for hate crimes.

Rob Hill, who serves as the state director for Mississippi — where the murder took place — for the Human Rights Campaign said, “There is an epidemic of violence against transgender people, and particularly women of color, across the country, and yet today is the first time a perpetrator will be sentenced under federal hate crimes charges for killing a transgender person because that crime crossed a state line.”

There have so far been at least eight reported murders of trans women in the United States in 2017 — all of them women of color, with seven being black and one being Native American.

Vallum, a member of the Latin Kings gang, claims to have killed Williamson out of fear that other members of the gang would discover that he had once dated a transgender woman. Though he expressed regret for having murdered her in an interview with the Sun Herald, Vallum mostly seems to be disappointed with the way things turned out for him.

If there was one thing that I could take back I wish that would be it, he said. I would even trade places with Mercedes so that I wouldn’t have to go through all this that I’m having to go through now. It’s just not worth it.”

Hopefully, this Mississippi ruling marks the beginning of the countrys dedication to protecting the lives of those in the transgender community.",1
"The video of a teen girl being brutally beaten by three other girls that went viral was initially ruled a racist attack by the victims father, but the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office determined that race or religion did not play a role in the attack

Investigators state the beating that Manall Munshi took by the three other girls while others stood around and filmed, was over a boy and that Munshi and another girl agreed to meet up and fight.

Though eventually, Munshi was mauled by another two girls and eventually had to be taken to the hospital.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations is working closely with the family and wants to know why and how law enforcement made their final conclusion.

“The act of standing around while a girl is being beaten up without any assistance is a way of bullying by those people saying, I can see you beaten up and I am going to do nothing, but film you. Isn’t that bullying, We are content with what is happening with them being brought to justice. On the other hand, we are also worried how in depth the investigation was made” said Wilfredo Ruiz, Communications Director with CAIR.

Munshi’s Father claims his daughter often said that students make fun of her because she is a Muslim, calling her terrorist, and had talked to the school about the situation, but school officials at West Boca Raton High School student could not provide any documentation to support the claim.

Manaal Munshi is out of the hospital now, and the three girls that attacked her could face simple battery charges.

"EAST BAY, CA – An inmate at the behavioral health housing unit at Alameda Countys Santa Rita Jail in Dublin who allegedly was killed by his cellmate on Tuesday was identified by sheriffs officials as 56-year-old Dat Thanh Luong of Union City. He had been scheduled to be taken to Napa State Hospital soon for a mental health evaluation, authorities said. Deputies at the jail, which is the sixth-largest jail in the country and currently houses 2,129 inmates, found Luong in his cell at Housing Unit 9 at about 8:50 a.m. Tuesday after other inmates told them that they heard a noise and he was lying on the floor, Sgt. Ray Kelly said. The deputies who spotted the victim discovered a grisly scene and Luong was pronounced dead at the scene, according to Kelly. The victims cellmate, who was covered in blood, tried to flee but deputies were able to tackle him and detain him after a brief struggle, Kelly said. The unit where Luong and the suspect, 73, were being held is a maximum-security unit for inmates with mental illness or behavioral problems. Authorities arent yet releasing the suspects name because theyre having trouble communicating with him, Kelly said. The suspect, who was arrested in Hayward last Thursday on suspicion of battery and making threats, is currently being held in an isolation cell away from the rest of the jail population while Alameda County prosecutors determine if hes mentally competent enough to be interviewed about the incident, according to Kelly. Luong was arrested in Union City in January on an assault with a deadly weapon charge, Kelly said. Luong and the suspect are both Asian men who have mental health issues and authorities dont believe the killing was racially motivated or gang-related, Kelly said. It appears that no weapons were used and authorities believe Luong was either strangled or beaten to death, he said. There were no indications that Luong and the suspect couldnt be placed together and theyd only been in the same cell for a few days, Kelly said. There only have been five inmate homicides in Santa Rita since the jail opened in 1989 and Luongs death is the first homicide there since 2008, according to Kelly. Most of the other inmate homicides also involved fights between inmates with mental health issues, Kelly said. --Bay City News/Image of victim via ACSO",0

Univision, HuffPost, and the New York Times opinion section identified a common thread in the reports weve received in which people of color are harassed with Go back to your country. This type of harassment affects both immigrants and United States citizens alike, reporters found.

Several stories published by our partners focused on racial harassment on public transportation, using tips to illustrate something officials were also seeing. The New York City Commission on Human Rights observed a 480 percent increase in claims of discriminatory harassment between 2015 and 2016, according to the New York Times opinion section. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority recorded 24 cases of offensive graffiti through April, compared to 35 in all of last year, the Boston Globe found. Univision covered multiple incidents involving Latinos targeted in incidents on the New York City subway.

Combing through our database, BuzzFeed discovered there were dozens of reported incidents in K-12 schools in which students cited President Donald Trumps name or slogans to harass minority classmates. This echoed a pattern Univision had reported on: In November, the Teaching Tolerance project at the Southern Poverty Law Center received more than 10,000 responses to an educator survey indicating an uptick in anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim, and anti-immigrant activity in schools.

Our local partners reported on how hate incidents affect communities across the country: anti-Semitic graffiti in Phoenix, Islamophobia in Minneapolis, racist vandalism and homophobic threats in Seattle, white supremacist activity at a California university, racist harassment and vandalism in Boston, racism in the workplace in New Orleans, and hate incidents throughout Florida.

There are a few questions for which answers continue to elude us: How many hate crimes happen each year, and why is the record keeping so inadequate?

The Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is required to track hate crimes, counts between 5,000 and 6,000 of them annually. But the Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates the total is closer to 250,000. One explanation for the gap is that many victims—more than half, according to a recent estimate—dont report what happened to them to police.

Even if they do, law enforcement agencies arent all required to report to the FBI, meaning their reports might never make it into the national tally. The federal government is hardly a model of best practices; many federal agencies dont report their data, either—even though theyre legally required to do so.

"First, it was our community centers. Now, its our cemeteries and schools. And my heart is breaking.

If you watch the news on a daily basis, you may be have heard about the swelling number of bomb threats being called into Jewish Community Centers (JCCs) throughout North America, with that number reaching more than 120 total just this past Monday, February 27, 2017.

Small children and seniors have had to endure mandatory evacuations from these buildings evacuated in at least 33 states in the U.S. and two Canadian providences — and the situation has spread a strong stench of fear to the Jewish community, including myself.

I live in Orlando, Florida, and weve seen our fair share of anti-Semitic attacks.

Just this week a 12-year-old Jewish student found three swastikas and the message, Why are the ovens getting hotter? scrawled across her assigned seat on the public school bus she rides twice each day.

According to an article on Politico:

There were 56 hate crimes reported in New York City as of Sunday, Feb. 12, up from just 31 incidents over the same time period last year, according to figures released today by the New York Police Department. The increase was led by a rise in anti-Semitic crimes, which jumped from 13 to 28. No other category of hate crime was in double digits.

While the graffiti and swastikas have been removed, the message of hatred cannot be erased.

Its even affecting our dead. In the span of just two weeks, three Jewish cemeteries in the U.S. have been vandalized — first in St. Louis, then Philadelphia, and most recently in Rochester, New York. Between just the first two cemeteries, approximately 300 tombstones were turned over and broken.

I can only imagine what the families of the loved ones buried there must be thinking or feeling. I have several dear family members — including my mother, grandfather, grandmother, and great-grandmother — buried in a Jewish cemetery in South Florida.

If this ever happened there, I would lose my mind.

How deep must your hatred be to target the most helpless among us — our children, our seniors, and our dead?

Thankfully, gracious friends in the Muslim community have spoken out against the vicious attacks and have offered their help.

Tarek El-Messidi, who runs a Muslim non-profit called Celebrate Mercy, started a fundraising campaign with political organizer Linda Sarsour after the first cemetery was attacked in St. Louis. The fund quickly reached, and even surpassed its goal, now having raised over $130,000.

The pair plan to use the extra money to help repair the damage in the Philadelphia cemetery as well.

What can you do to help?

Speak up. Use your social media accounts — Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc. — and share whats going on so that more people will be aware.

Im asking the same from our President, because the more we shed light on these hateful acts, the more we can effect change.

We WILL get through this.

They bend and fall, but we rise and stand firm. — Tehillim 20:8",1
"The man accused of plowing a car into a crowd of people protesting a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing a woman and injuring dozens more, now faces federal hate crime charges.

The Department of Justice announced that an indictment returned Wednesday charges James Alex Fields Jr., 21, of Maumee, Ohio, with 30 crimes, including one count of a hate crime resulting in the death of Heather Heyer, and 28 other hate crimes involving an attempt to kill dozens of other people who were injured. Another charge accuses him of racially motivated violent interference with a federally protected activity.

Last summers violence in Charlottesville cut short a promising young life and shocked the nation, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. Todays indictment should send a clear message to every would-be criminal in America that we aggressively prosecute violent crimes of hate that threaten the core principles of our nation.

Authorities have said Fields, described by a former teacher as having a keen interest in Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler, drove his speeding car into a group of people demonstrating against the Unite the Right rally Aug. 12 that drew hundreds of white nationalists to the college town, where officials planned to remove a Confederate monument.

Fields already faces state charges including first-degree murder and is set to face a jury trial later this year. He has been in custody since the rally. The attorney representing Fields on those counts declined comment Wednesday.

The car attack came after the rally had descended into chaos — with violent brawling between attendees and counterdemonstrators — and authorities had forced the crowd to disband.

The eight-page indictment alleges Fields decided to attend the rally on or before Aug. 8. As he prepared to leave to travel to Charlottesville, a family member sent him a text message urging him to be careful, the indictment said.

Fields replied, Were not the ones who need to be careful, and attached an image of Hitler, according to the indictment, which also says Fields used social media to promote racist views.

Fields then attended the rally Aug. 12, engaging in chants promoting white supremacist and other racist and anti-Semitic views, the indictment said.

After authorities forced the crowd to disband, Fields drove his car toward the area where a racially and ethnically diverse crowd had gathered to protest, the indictment said.

Fields rapidly accelerated, through a stop sign and across a raised pedestrian mall, and drove directly into the crowd, it said.

In a statement, FBI Special Agent in Charge Adam S. Lee of the Richmond Division thanked the business owners and Charlottesville residents who he said worked with us and provided a massive volume of evidence in this case.

The federal civil rights case is not the first under Sessions Justice Department, but it is certainly the most high-profile one. Critics of Sessions for the last year have been concerned about what they see as less aggressive enforcement of federal civil rights laws, and especially the Justice Departments lack of intervention against local police agencies with troubled relationships with minorities.

But in bringing the prosecution, Sessions appeared to assert himself as independent from President Donald Trump — who blamed the violence on both sides and was accused of emboldening racists — and suggested that the Justice Department would continue to treat racially motivated acts of violence as hate crimes.

"A black man in Washingston state who was the victim of what his family and prosecutors called a hate crime attack was in intensive care as of Wednesday with a traumatic brain injury.

Authorities have charged an unidentified 18-year-old man for the assault on 26-year-old DaShawn Horne. The suspect faces charges for first-degree assault and malicious harassment, the state’s designation for hate crimes.

The events that led to Horne’s attack started on January 19 when Horne went a local nightclub and met a woman and the two went back to her home in Auburn, according to charging papers obtained by the Seattle Times.

The woman then ordered a Lyft ride to take Horne home in the morning on January 20. As Horne was leaving, the woman’s brother, Julian Tuimauga, who authorities identified as Asian Pacific Islander, approached him.

Tuimauga asked the Lyft driver who he was picking up and the driver said the woman’s name. Tuimauga then walked away and the driver then heard Horne and the 18-year-old arguing.

The driver of the vehicle then heard a “thump sound like a bat had struck something,” the charging papers said.

The driver witnessed Tuimauga hit Horne in the back of the head with an aluminum bat twice before he fell to the ground.

With Horne on the ground, Tuimauga then said: “This is what happens when you bring black people around here,” according to his charging papers.

The driver then drove to a nearby house and called 911 around 10:30 a.m. But Tuimauga was not done.

Authorities say he then delivered three more blows to Horne’s unconscious body before recording cellphone video of himself yelling racial slurs, including the N-word, at Horne.

A neighbors surveillance camera captured some of the attack when Horne was already unconscious.

Following the attack, Tuimauga admitted to authorities that he struck Horne for having sex with Tuimaugas sister.

A GoFundMe page for Horne has raised about $22,000, which will go toward his loss of wages. On the page, Horne’s family describes him as an “amazing father, brother, son and friend.”

“He was an innocent victim of a heinous crime,” they wrote. “He is funny, loving, strong, hard-working clerk for the United States Postal Service. Dashawn loves to make people laugh and feel protected. His personality and presence lights up a room. His love and compassion has impacted many lives.”

Doctors told Hornes family that he will now spend the next several months in the hospital, and “He has a long road ahead towards recovery, according to the GoFundMe page.",1
"One Thousand Ministers March for Justice—attended by an estimated 3,000—on August 28, 2017, in Washington, D.C. RNS photo by Adelle M. Banks.

From Protestant preachers to Jewish cantors to Catholic nuns, religious leaders of a range of faiths demonstrated in Washington, D.C., for racial justice, criticizing the silence of some within their own ranks on the subject of white supremacy.

Wearing stoles, robes, and yarmulkes, the participants proceeded August 28 on a 1.7-mile route from the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial to the Justice Department. Organizers estimated close to 3,000 ministers took part, a larger turnout than suggested by the title of the event: “One Thousand Ministers March for Justice.”

“We wanted to say this nation is in moral trouble,” Al Sharpton told those assembled at the King memorial.

One protester carried a sign saying “Black Lives Matter To This Rabbi.”

The march was originally planned to protest increased hate crimes, mass incarceration, and discrimination and to call on the Trump administration and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to address those issues.

But the recent violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, where neo-Nazi, white supremacist, and white nationalist protesters clashed with anti-racism activists, prompted increased interest in the gathering.

Sister Patricia Chappell, executive director of Pax Christi USA, who is a black Catholic nun, decried white supremacy. She believes that “even our institutional church is racist” and needs to address some of its policies and practices.

Sharpton’s National Action Network spearheaded the march on the 54th anniversary of the March on Washington. Many of the people had planned to be at the march before the Charlottesville events spurred more to join them. Some speakers addressed other issues that concern them, such as criminal justice, voter suppression, and health care reform.

“You’re going to see the victims of Nazism, the victims of white supremacy march today to the Justice Department,” Sharpton said just before leading the march through downtown Washington.

Jamal-Harrison Bryant, an African Methodist Episcopal pastor from Baltimore, criticized evangelical ministers who support and advise the president “and declare erroneously an outright lie—that Donald Trump is a man of God,” he said. “They do not reflect the body of Christ at large.”

The interfaith crowd took part in a call-and-response conversation with speakers who urged them to sing, recite scripture, and high-five each other in shows of unity.

“Let me tell all the white supremacists and KKK and everybody that America is a multifaith country—do you all agree?” said Sikh leader Rajwant Singh, who was greeted by cheers. “America belongs to all of us.”

Jonah Dov Pesner, director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, recalled that Jews marched 5,000 years ago “out of Pharaoh’s slavery and bondage in Egypt,” he said. “And we know today that we do have the power to break the bondage of the modern pharaoh.”

The National Action Network, a predominantly black, Christian organization, also was an organizer of a 50th anniversary commemoration of the March on Washington that was held in 2013 and drew throngs to the National Mall to remember the event that featured King’s “I Have a Dream” speech. Monday’s march originally focused on clergy but some groups encouraged all people of faith to attend.

Some clergy who have supported or advised Trump gathered at the National Press Club instead of at the King Memorial and issued a statement about the need for the government and religious officials to do more to bridge racial divides.

“Naturally, we need government, business, law enforcement, and community stakeholders to partner with us,” their statement read. “The glue that will keep our nation together, though, is the Church and faith leaders.” —Religion News Service

"A white man accused of opening fire on two Indian immigrants at a Kansas bar in February in a shooting that heightened international concern about American hostility toward foreigners has been indicted on federal hate crime charges, the Justice Department announced Friday.

Adam W. Purinton was kicked out of a bar in Olathe, Kan., on Feb. 22 after patrons complained that he had leveled ethnic slurs at the two men and questioned their immigration status. But Mr. Purinton, 52, soon returned to Austins Bar with a semiautomatic pistol and shot the men, killing one and injuring the other, the authorities said. The gunman also shot a third man who attempted to intervene, striking him in the hand and in the chest, the indictment says.

On Friday, the Justice Department announced that Mr. Purinton had been indicted by a federal grand jury on two hate crime charges and a firearm charge.

The indictment accuses Mr. Purinton of shooting and killing one of the Indian nationals, Srinivas Kuchibhotla, 32, “because of his actual and perceived race, color, religion and national origin.” It also charged that he committed the same crime against the second Indian national, Alok Madasani, who was wounded but survived.

The Duke is partnering with the nonprofit investigative journalism site ProPublica, other news organizations and civil rights groups to help track hate crimes and incidents of bias at Duquesne University as part of their Documenting Hate project.

The FBI defines hate crimes as “criminal offenses motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender or gender identity.” Forty-five states, including Pennsylvania, have laws against hate crimes. There are also federal hate crime laws.

ProPublica explains that a bias incident is “an offense motivated in whole or in part by the offender’s animosity toward the victim’s race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability or other protected status.” These interactions may not be considered crimes, but could include instances of intimidation or harassment.

According to the FBI, hate crimes have been on the rise in the United States. Yet, many incidents go unreported, and the government struggles to keep good track of the ones that do. We want to change that.

While students or faculty can report incidents to Duquesne Public Safety or other administrators, their personal stories often go untold. The Documenting Hate form allows victims to speak to Duke reporters about their experiences. Information submitted through the form will not be shared with the university, and sources can choose to remain anonymous.

Only the partners in the Documenting Hate partnership will have access to the information. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit that tracks hate groups and a Documenting Hate partner, advises that a victim should always contact law enforcement first. Submitting this form does not notify law enforcement authorities.

If you have been a victim of a hate crime or bias incident, or been a witness of an event, please fill out the form below. A Duke staff writer may reach out to you for more information.

Court documents allege he said, in part, “I’m a white supremacist. I’m going to get what I want and kill all (N-word)s.”

“It’s not acceptable in this community or any community,” said Canandaigua Police Chief Stephen Hedworth. “In the following days, we obtained more information about other incidences that happened around that same time frame, in other areas in the city.”

"OutRight Action International honors and remembers the victims of the shooting on Latin Night at Pulse Club in Orlando one year ago. We are still deeply saddened by the loss of 49 lives and injuries to more than 50 others in the ISIS-claimed attack; an attack which was an act of hate and violence against LGBTIQ persons and our fundamental dignity.

However, we are also proud to see the immense efforts to heal undertaken by the Orlando community and the solidarity from around the world in the year since the massacre. Worldwide condemnation of the attack was loud and for the most part recognized that violence and persecution of the LGBTIQ community is pervasive and must be put to an end. Many LGBTIQ communities around the world felt the attack on a personal level, knowing it could have happened to them. Many felt the familiarity of being at a club, dancing with other LGBTIQ people. Through our global partners, we at OutRight saw acts of solidarity in cities from all around the world.

The aftermath of the Orlando shooting also saw the first-ever statement by the United Nation’s Security Council referencing sexual orientation, denouncing the attack and acknowledging that it was anti-gay biased. This important statement sets precedence in the international peace and security arena that queer lives matter, and they are being targeted; a matter of international concern.

However, we all know that there remains much to be done in the wake of the shooting in the United States and globally. The underlying issues that contributed to the shooting remain unresolved, and has indeed increased, in the past year. Both state-sponsored and individual acts of homophobia and transphobia are far too common in the US and worldwide. In the US, the administration is rolling back protections for trans students and undermining international systems and structures that have contributed to providing safety and services for LGBTIQ people. Internationally we have seen many examples of arrests, torture and even killings of LGBTIQ people, as can be seen by the recently reported detention of men presumed to be gay in Chechnya and Indonesia.

All around the world LGBTIQ people’s, arguably all people’s, rights to exist, to assemble, to express themselves are being targeted. With greater visibility and demands of equality of and by the LGBTIQ community, we are also seeing drastic pushback aimed at erasing our lives and silencing our rights through force and threats. Issues impacting the LGBTIQ community are heightened by anti-Muslim, xenophobic, anti-women sentiments in the US and beyond, as exemplified by President Trumps “Muslim travel ban,” the consequences of which are devastating and far reaching. The idea that anti-Muslim policies would make society safer is a forced illusion; we feel, and are, no safer with policies that put white-supremacy on a pedestal and oppress minority communities in any way.

To prevent more attacks against the LGBTIQ and Muslim communities, we must work to resolve issues that affect all disenfranchised communities around the world. We must continue not to conflate the actions of one man, or ISIS affiliates and sympathizers, with all Muslims, we must fight against Islamophobia the marginalization and villainization it propagates. And we must not pit minorities against each other, but rather stand together in solidarity against bigotry, violence, and discrimination everywhere. Indeed, OutRight Action International has joined 58 other LGBTIQ, Muslim, and Latinx communities in a unity statement in commemoration of the first day of remembrance of the massacre.

We need a peaceful, community-driven, and global strategy to continue healing from events like the massacre at Pulse and prevent further violent crimes against LGBTIQ people, Muslims, and LGBTIQ Muslims globally.",1

When Officer Martin Halmi arrived, two people flagged him down. They said their friend had used heroin and was inside a room, barely breathing. Halmi found the young man slouched over a chair, pale, sweaty, and unable to respond. The victim did not respond to the first dose of Narcan that Halmi administered.

"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- A Toledo-area man accused of driving his car into a crowd of protesters at a white supremacist rally in Virginia in August, killing one woman, was charged Wednesday with a federal hate-crime.

James Alex Fields Jr., 21, of Maumee, is in jail in Virginia, charged in a state court with first-degree murder and other crimes related to the death of Heather Heyer at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia on Aug. 12. A federal grand jury in Virginia indicted him Wednesday with 30 charges related to Heyers death and dozens other he is accused of injuring.

Authorities say Fields was the man behind the wheel of a Dodge Challenger and plowed into a large group of people crowded on the street during the rally. He put his car into reverse, up a hill, accelerated and drove directly into the crowd.

Police arrested him shortly after.

The Unite the Right rally was a gathering of people with fringe and far-right ideologies, many of whom hold racist and anti-Semitic beliefs against African-Americans, Jewish people and immigrants. The white supremacists and counterprotesters clashed during the event, leading police to declare the event an unlawful assembly and disperse the crowd.

The Charlottesville rally was one of the first times many Americans became aware of the size of these groups in the present day. Many of these groups have felt emboldened by President Donald Trumps election.

Fields shared those views, promoting white supremacy on multiple social media accounts and expressing support of the views of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany online and in person, federal prosecutors say.

His indictment says a family member sent him a text urging him to be careful as he prepared to travel from Ohio to Virginia. In response, Fields texted were not the ones who need to be careful and attached an image of Hitler.

At the Department of Justice, we remain resolute that hateful ideologies will not have the last word and that their adherents will not get away with violent crimes against those they target, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a news release.

Fields mother told The Associated Press in August that she and her son had recently moved to Maumee from Florence, Kentucky, a Cincinnati suburb.

Pine Lawn Police Officer John Bernsen said Tripp drove at speeds near 130 mph before he crashed into farmland and was then taken into custody. He was charged with Felony DWI, resisting arrest and Careless and Imprudent Driving charges. Bail was set at $40,000. This is reportedly his fourth DWI. Authorities say they plan to ask that his parole be revoked. Tripp was on parole after serving a prison term for abandonment of a corpse. . He admitted to dumping his friend, Valerie Butlers body, who had overdosed on heroin He pleaded guilty to the charge in January 2012. Butler, 25, of St. Ann, was seen leaving a Florissant bar called Handlebars with two men, one of whom was identified by authorities as Tripp. Butlers body was found several weeks later near Prouhet Farm Road in Bridgeton. The medical examiner said Butler died of acute heroin intoxication. While Butler was missing reports of her being spotted in Maryland Heights surfaced and the Maryland Heights Police told Patch a report was taken regarding a sighting. The field where Tripp was arrested Thursday is less than a two mile drive from the field where Butlers body was found two years ago. In addition to the two-year sentence in the corpse abandonment case, Tripp was serving a a five-year sentence from December 2010 for drug possession with intent to distribute conviction. The sentences were to run consecutively and included time served that began July 26, 2011. Read more about Tripp and his involvement in Valerie Butlers case:",0
"PORTLAND, Ore. -- A Southwest Washington said he was assaulted and threatened by a man who ran him off the road and targeted him because of his race.

“I’m scared,” said Armando, who asked that we not use his last name. “You don’t feel secure anywhere.”

Portland police say they are investigating the incident.

Armando was driving northbound on Interstate 5, just south of the Interstate Bridge, late Friday night when someone in a truck started tailgating him. Armando said it went on for several minutes before the driver side-swiped him. Armando pulled over. The other driver did, too.

“He said, ‘go back to your country,’” Armando said.

The man did not stop there. Armando said he went back to his truck and retrieved a gun.

“He pulled the gun and said, ‘get out of my country you f-----g Mexican, or I kill you,’” said Armando. “He put the gun right in my forehead.”

Armando says the man pistol-whipped him and took off. Armando’s first call was to the police. He then called his friend, Ron.

“He isn’t out just for Hispanic people,” said Ron. “He’s out there as a ticking time bomb. Next time one or many may be killed.”

The fear of the unknown is why Armando is sharing his story.

“The racism needs to stop,” he said. “The prejudice needs to stop.”

Armando says the suspect was driving a Dodge Ram truck. There should be damage to the driver’s side. Anyone with information about the case is urged to contact the Portland Police Bureau.

"In 2013, Russia instituted its ban on spreading propaganda for non-traditional sexual relations.

Since then, research shows that anti-LGBT hate crimes have doubled in the country. In 2010, there were only 18 people sentenced for crimes against the LGBT community, and that number was 65 in 2015. Out of the 250 hate crimes analyzed, 200 of them were for murder. Most of the victims were gay men.

Svetlana Zakharova, a board member of the Russian LGBT Network, spoke to Reuters saying, Offenders have become more aggressive and less fearful. It seems to them that, to some extent, the government supports their actions. Many perpetrators openly talk about their crimes as noble deeds.”

Because homosexuality is illegal in Russia, researches say the numbers are a lot lower than reality. A lot of hate crimes go unreported, and arent investigated or persecuted appropriately.

Sadly, this hostility between the Russian government and the LGBT community has been going on for years, and is nothing new. Over the summer the reports of Chechnya cracking down on the LGBT community. Putin refused to comment and Chechnya was allowed to carry on.

As of 2016, Russia was ranked as the second least friendly country to LGBT people, with Azerbaijan having the worst ranking.",1
"ALHAMBRA, CA - A Monterey Park man who allegedly attacked his wife while she was in the shower, stabbing and slashing her more than 30 times as she tried to flee, was charged Tuesday with attempted murder and other counts.

Reasons to (not) Celebrate



and promised to require mandatory training for all of its employees in thousands of stores.



Well, that memo didn’t reach all Starbuck employees because one of them in Madison hadn’t even heard of the incident and is certain their store is not doing any

specific cultural sensitivity training. Is there anyone who thinks that this same incident cannot happen in Madison with its high arrest of Black men?



While visiting my 104 year old Aunt in Georgia, my cousin, a hospice nurse, would go by Starbucks every morning for coffee. She says she is still debating whether to

ever return because she is tired of giving her business to companies who are unjust to Black people. She asked the rhetorical question, “Why is white America afraid

of Black men?” I replied, “And why would police arrest men for doing nothing but sitting in a coffee shop?”



Police are allowed a lot of discretion in determining arrests, clearly both the Starbucks manager and Philadelphia police were in agreement that to be Black men

warrants arrest, and the rest of us wouldn’t have known about this if their arrest hadn’t been recorded and posted. Yet, there are few times that European Americans

(white people) are ever charged or arrested for hate crimes.



Seeking Tolerance & Justice Over Hate (STAJOH) is a Madison committee composed of representatives of government agencies from the City of Madison, Dane

County, the Madison Metropolitan School District, the State of Wisconsin, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison as well as community-based agencies throughout

Dane County. They have a website on the definitions of a hate crime. The information is vague and allows a weak interpretation of a hate crime that 1) Not itself a

crime, but a penalty enhancer, 2) Increases the potential penalty of crime, 3) Must be a criminal act — battery, disorderly conduct, etc — before there is a hate crime

and 4) Hateful conduct alone is not a hate crime, unless the conduct itself is criminal.



Thank God for academic graduations, beginning with elementary schools all the way up to colleges and

universities. We celebrate student achievement despite the limitations on the number of tickets available to

attend these graduations. One would think that in Madison, given the poor graduation rates of students of

color, more tickets would be made available as an incentive to keep on graduating until a university degree

is attained.



I still thank God for giving families a time to celebrate hard work and perseverance since there has not been

a lot of reasons for celebrations across the US. There are more tragic shootings in schools, increased

arrests of African Americans for little or no reasons and more reported incidents of racism and anti-Semitism.



Snow in April in Madison made it seem like summer was far, far away. Summer has finally arrived and I

hope that warm weather and people being outside even more, will not cause more racist experiences for

people of color, Jewish people, and immigrants.

Most have read about the incident at a Philadelphia Starbucks where two African American men were

arrested, not buying anything at the coffee store while waiting for a friend. Starbucks gave a public apology

"Srinivas Kuchibhotla died in an anti-immigrant attack at a Kansas bar. His wife, Sunayana Dumala, faces an uncertain future.

OLATHE, Kan. —

Sunayana Dumala tried once again to enter the worship room she and her husband, Srinivas Kuchibhotla, had created in their home for daily prayers. Kuchibhotla had built an intricate wooden shrine by hand two years ago, a small sacred edifice where they would kneel each morning. Months after his death, it became a place where she would honor him.

On a Wednesday night in February, a man with a semi-automatic pistol and a distorted notion of U.S. pride turned ordinary people into shooting victims and survivors — and he turned Dumala into a widow.

Kuchibhotla, an Indian-born engineer, was confronted about his immigration status at a bar, and then fatally shot. By the time police arrived, Kuchibhotla was dying, and his close friend Alok Madasani was wounded. Another patron who tried to stop the attack was also struck by gunfire.

Three months to the day after her husband’s slaying, Dumala stood at the entrance of the prayer room alone, looking toward a window that framed storm clouds. She turned away.

“Everything about this room, everything about this house,” she said later, “reminds me of my Srinu,” the nickname she gave him during their courtship.

It was in the quiet of the next morning that Dumala, 32, decided that would be the day she would step inside the worship room. What had been unbearable the previous day seemed surmountable, if only because it was the next painful step.

So she willed herself up the stairs, inching past the framed collage of wedding photos, and into the room. She cleaned each of the deity figurines with warm water. Then she prayed for peace in a whisper just above the sound of children’s play at the elementary school next door.

In some ways, what one man shouted in anger and one woman uttered in grief capture one of America’s most troubling intersections.

“Get out of my country!” the gunman would yell, before opening fire on the two Indian men he later said he believed were from Iran.

“Do we belong here?” the widow would ask in a Facebook post six days after the shooting

The episode happened at dinnertime in a neighborhood bar, part of a spasm of hatred that seems to be uncoiling in towns and cities across the nation — and in rising numbers.

“We’ve read many times in newspapers of some kind of shooting happening,” Dumala said at a news conference in February at the headquarters of Garmin, where Kuchibhotla was a senior aviation-systems engineer.

“And we always wondered, how safe?”

The realization that her husband was killed because of intolerance, because he was not born in America, is what forced her to emerge from this personal, private hell. If people were to know the aftermath of a hate crime, the crater-size void and endless questions left behind, if the victims were rendered as three-dimensional, maybe there would be less fear, less hate, she thought.

“My story needs to be spread,” she said. “Srinu’s story needs to be known. We have to do something to reduce the hate crimes. Even if we can save one other person, I think that would give peace to Srinu and give me the satisfaction that his sacrifice did not go in vain.”

On the morning of his death, Kuchibhotla left for work before his wife. “Bye,” he said, hurrying past her, a casual farewell that would come to haunt Dumala for its brevity and finality.

Just before 6 p.m., Dumala texted and called Kuchibhotla to make plans for the evening. His cellphone was off. She had hoped they could spend time that evening in their backyard in Olathe, sipping tea and watching the sun lower into the horizon.

Dumala made calls to their friends looking for her husband. Maybe he had gone to have drinks at Austins Bar & Grill, his favorite after-work spot, with Madasani. But Madasani’s phone was off, too.

She began to scroll through Facebook. A news story popped into her feed: Three people shot at Austins.

“I was getting scared, some kind of feeling was going through me. I was all alone,” she said, pausing to catch her breath, her face dampened by tears. “This is not my usual Srinu, I am saying to myself. He would have reached out to me somehow to let me know he is safe.”

Dumala’s instincts were right. The best friends were at Austins at their regular table on the patio, the one closest to the door, discussing Bollywood movies and drinking Miller Lites.

The assailant approached. Witnesses recall him wearing a white T-shirt with military-style pins, his head wrapped in a white scarf. He was intent on finding out one thing: Did the men at the table belong in the country?

Adam W. Purinton, a white Navy veteran, turned to the two brown-complexioned men, both living in the United States for years, and demanded to know their immigration status.

“Out of the blue comes this weird-looking gentleman, I say weird-looking because he had anger on his face,” said Madasani, 32, an aviation-systems engineer at Garmin. “I did not hear what he was saying instantly, but I saw the look on Srinivas’ face change drastically. I looked at Adam and he walked toward me, he came to me and said, ‘Are you here legally?’”

Madasani did not respond. Instead, he went inside to get the manager. Ian Grillot, 24, and another patron asked Purinton to leave and escorted him from the patio. But he didn’t go far, pacing outside in the parking lot.

Madasani said he and Kuchibhotla had decided to leave, but were stopped as one by one, other patrons apologized. One guy paid their tab; the bar manager gave them another round of beer and fried pickles, a favorite of Kuchibhotla. “Everybody kept coming up to us saying this is not what we represent, you guys belong here,” he said.

It was 7:15 p.m. The winter sun had already set, but it was unseasonably warm, in the high 70s. It was just after halftime of the University of Kansas basketball game against Texas Christian University. Austins was packed with Jayhawk fans besides its usual cast of regulars.

Kuchibhotla and Madasani were back at their table talking. The crowd on the patio had thinned out during the halftime break, but the televisions were still blaring.

According to the authorities, Purinton returned to the bar with a handgun. He stood in the patio door and pointed his gun toward the two men.

Suddenly, the sound of gunfire. “Pop, pause, then pop, pop, pop,” said Tim Hibbard, the owner of a software company who was sitting at the bar sipping a Blue Moon beer. “It wasn’t like the movies where the gunfire is large and demanding of attention.”

Madasani, who had been sitting on the other side of the table, hit the ground, forced by a bullet, instinct or both. He crawled on his belly toward the opposite door. He thought the bullets were close by because the floor shook with each gunshot. “All I was thinking about at the time was about my baby, all I was thinking of was my wife’s belly,” said Madasani, whose wife was pregnant with their first child, a boy due in July. “In flashes, I was thinking, ‘I have to live.’”

Once outside, he realized he had been shot in the left leg. “I saw Srinivas on the floor, not moving. I kept on yelling to everyone, ‘Leave me, go and attend to him.’”

Grillot, the bar patron who had intervened earlier, chased Purinton into the parking lot. Purinton turned and shot him in the chest and hand.

Hate-crime charge

As people scattered, Vincent Baird, who was headed to the gas station across the street, ran toward the chaos to help. With four years of experience as an Army medic, he went straight to Kuchibhotla, whose breathing was shallow and labored.

Baird could see a gunshot wound in his chest. With the help of two others, Baird said, he cut a 4-inch square from an unused garbage bag and taped it over the wound.

Kuchibhotla stopped breathing at a couple of points, Baird said. Each time, he performed chest compressions until Kuchibhotla started breathing again and an ambulance arrived. Kuchibhotla was pronounced dead at the University of Kansas Hospital.

In the chaos, Purinton had fled. He ended up 80 miles away at a bar in Clinton, Missouri, where he told a bartender he had shot “two Iranians.”

The next day, Dumala learned the details of her husband’s slaying. An Olathe police officer and an agent from the FBI told her the assailant’s identity and alleged motivation.

Purinton, 52, was formally charged with premeditated first-degree murder and two counts of premeditated attempted murder. Last month, he was also indicted on federal hate-crime charges.

The term “hate crime” was being used over and over by police, journalists and politicians to describe the death of her husband. All of a sudden, Kuchibhotla was a hate-crime statistic, an example to bolster anti-hate legislation.

Dumala was aghast, baffled by the man who took her husband from her. “That guy, I think he was hurt, I don’t know what hurt him,” she said. “What is he doing by taking away this life? Did he serve his purpose? Did he lessen his anger? Even I have anger now, but that does not give me the right to go and take away his life.”

On a Tuesday afternoon in Hyderabad, the body of Srinivas Kuchibhotla was placed on a pyre of logs. His funeral was held nine days before what would have been his 33rd birthday.",1
"Two Orange County, California men are facing hate crime charges for spitting on and threatening a gay couple in a Seal Beach parking lot in November.

The OC Register reports:

Samuel Blake Wickwire (18), is facing two felony counts each of criminal threats and violation of civil rights, with a sentencing enhancement for hate crimes. He faces up to six years in prison if convicted, according to the Orange County District Attorney’s Office.

His co-defendant, Wade James Rutledge, 27, of Seal Beach was charged on Dec. 5 and has pleaded not guilty to one felony count each of dissuading a witness by force or threat and hate crime assault. Rutledge faces up to seven years if convicted.

The OC Weekly reported:

[Rutledge] and others with him allegedly approached a man and his boyfriend in the parking lot near 10th Street and Ocean Avenue in Seal Beach around 7 p.m. Nov. 3 and hurled homophobic insults at them and threatened them with violence, the OCDA says.

When the first victim tried to call the cops, Rutledge allegedly grabbed his arm, forcing the cell phone out of the caller’s hand and disconnecting the call, say prosecutors, who add that after returning to his group of friends with the phone, the defendant walked back to return it to the caller but warned him against calling the police again.

As the boyfriends got into a car to leave the area, Rutledge is accused of shoving the second man into the passenger seat, slamming the car door on the victim’s arm and yelling at them to hurry up and drive off, the OCDA says.

A subsequent Seal Beach Police Department investigation led to Rutledge’s arrest on Sunday. He is next due in court Dec. 14 in Westminster for a pre-trial hearing.

KTLA adds:

Wickwire allegedly spit on one of the victims, and while one of the victims called 911, Rutledge allegedly grabbed the victim’s arm, and forced the phone out of his hands. Rutledge then returned the phone to the victim but told him to leave and not call the police, officials said.

As the victims went into their car to leave, Rutledge allegedly shoved the other victim into the passenger seat and slammed the victim’s arm while yelling at them to hurry and leave the area.",1

"Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer and representatives of the LGBT community called for more hate crime reporting in the wake of a Los Angeles County report released last week indicating that for the first time in many years, members of the LGBT community were the most targeted group.

The report by the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations showed that 485 hate crimes were reported countywide in 2016 – one fewer than the previous year. However, the numbers in 2015 increased 24 percent compared to 2014, a “troubling statistic,” Feuer said.

“We know that our national political rhetoric has fueled deep divisions in our country. That makes it especially important that we work together to combat hate crimes that can sometimes be the result of those divisions,” Feuer added. “A key to tackling hate crime is that individuals who are victimized actually report those offenses. Then we can follow with tough and effective prosecution. But reporting is a real key.”

Feuer said the specific causes of the hate crime increases are not clear, but many could be attributed to the divisive political climate following last year’s national election. He added that the numbers may not have been as high this year because of less reporting among members of the Latino community who fear their immigration status may be affected if they interact with law enforcement.

“I have no doubt there has been an emboldening of hate,” Feuer said. “It indicates the urgency of addressing this problem.”

The report found that the LGBT community was disproportionately targeted for hate crimes with 118 incidents reported, the highest total since 2011. Hate crimes against the LGBT community also had the highest rate of violence – 81 percent – of all groups studied. It was the first time orientation surpassed race as the primary factor of a group being targeted for hate crimes.

Within the subcategory of transgender victims, hate crime rose from 18 in 2015 to 31 in 2016. Latina transgender women were predominantly targeted.

Additionally, the report indicated that hate crimes involving white supremacist ideology increased 67 percent – from 63 to 105 – representing 22 percent of all hate crimes countywide. During the post-2016 presidential election period last year from Nov. 8 through Dec. 31, hate crimes increased 9 percent – from 75 to 82. Religious-based hate crimes also increased, with 101 incidents reported in 2016. Two-thirds were hate crimes against the Jewish community.

Feuer added that more also needs to be done to help victims, and outlined services his office provides, such as help obtaining restitution and counseling. The city attorney also vowed to continue to prosecute all hate crimes that are presented to his office by law enforcement. His office prosecuted 17 cases involving hate crimes and hate incidents last year.

Mariana Marroquin, program manager for the Los Angeles LGBT Center’s Anti-Violence Project, also discussed services available to members of the LGBT community. The center offers legal assistance, counseling, support groups and programs tailored to victims of all ages who are victims of hate crimes.

“We have been educating the community about their rights,” Marroquin said. “If you are a victim of a hate crime, you are not alone. We are here for you. [If you commit a hate crime], law enforcement will get you and you will be prosecuted.”

The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors also called for more hate crime reporting.

“We are leading the effort to combat Islamophobia, homophobia and hatred against immigrants, and we are best able to accomplish these goals by having concrete reporting and data,” said Supervisor Hilda L. Solis, 1st District. “[The report’s] troubling news reiterates the need to protect our residents of this county who deserve to live free of prejudice, discrimination, harassment and violence. I will continue to make combatting hate crimes a priority.”

Anyone who believes they are victim of a hate crime should call police immediately. For information on reporting and the 2016 hate crimes report, visit lahumanrelations.org.",1

"Lafayette business owner feels targeted after salon vandalized Copyright by KRON - All rights reserved Video

LAFAYETTE (KRON)-- The owner of a hair salon in Lafayette feels threatened after his shop was vandalized.

Hairdresser, Clark Russell, spent much of his Sunday vacuuming up shards of glass after someone threw a rock through his salons door.

Rusell said it was a neighbor who alerted police about the vandalism.

He believes the incident is suspicious because the suspect didnt steal anything or enter his salon.

Russells theory has to do with a poster promoting a GoFundMe page for his husband who needs stem cell treatment.

Another possible reason he suspects his salon was targeted is because they are a gay minority couple.",1
"INDIANAPOLIS -- Hoosiers now have a place to turn to report hate crimes anonymously. On Thursday, the Central Indiana Alliance Against Hate announced it created a database, called tracking hate database.

Local activists said this will be a way to better track the number of hate crimes in the Hoosier State.

It was part of a full day conference where people from various minority groups, from the Muslim, Jewish and LGBT communities, spoke about what they see locally at the Indiana Response to Hate Conference.

Activists said theyre hoping lawmakers take up a hate crime bill next year, since Indiana is one of five states that does not allow judges to impose harsher sentences for hate crimes.

Just days after violence broke out in Charlottesville after a protest held by white supremacist groups, frustration lingering in Indianapolis at what many people we talked to call hate crimes.

Unfortunately what occurred in Charlottesville is not new, its not unique it happened to be caught on camera, said Amy Nelson, the executive director of Fair Housing Center of Central Indiana, which created the Central Indiana Alliance Against Hate.

The conference intended to give the hundreds of attendees an opportunity to hear how others deal with hate crimes when they happen, in Indiana and around the country.

Indiana State Police said there were 69 hate crimes last year, but thats only with 18 different law enforcement agencies reporting.

I think its low. I think unfortunately when it comes to both hate-based crimes and and hate-based incidents are underreported, said Nelson.

Attendees said the issue is very real here in Indiana.

This usually comes in the form of a swastika spray-painted somewhere or anti-Jewish graffiti taking place, said David Sklar, who is the director of government affairs for the Jewish Community Relations Council in Indianapolis.

So the tracking hate database keeps your identity anonymous and the hope is, it can shine a light on how many hate crimes occur in the Hoosier State.

We want to provide an opportunity for Hoosiers to report that so we can put better data together about the number of incidents about crimes that have occurred, said Nelson.

Lawmakers are paying attention. While Indiana is one of five states without a state law to give judges power to declare harsher punishment for hate crime, Republican Sen. Susan Glick said she believes theres more bipartisan support for passing a bill to allow these harsher penalties.

Indiana Sen. Greg Taylor said he thinks a bill could pass next year.

We as a general assembly owe it to Hoosiers to make sure everyone is protected, he said.

Taylor, a Democrat from Indianapolis, said state law allows judges to give longer sentences to people who point a weapon at police officers, attack the elderly, or force a child to do something inappropriate.

So he said the same should apply if a crime is committed and the motivation is because of someones race, religion, sexual orientation: anything defined by a hate crime.

We would not be setting a precedent right here, its already been in law that we enhance penalties for people, for things that people do that are just destructive to the stat as we well as this country, he said.

Similar bills have been proposed in the past but have not been passed by both chambers. Sen. Glick said shes heard lawmakers who do not support this idea say it would give preferential protection to certain portions of the population. But she said thats not the intent of how the law would be applied.

A person would need to be convicted of the crime and then the prosecutor would have to prove that criminal met the standards of hate crime defined by whatever bill is potentially passed. Only then could a judge impose a harsher sentence.",1
"One line of thought, supported by some statistical analysis , is that anti-immigrant sentiment after Brexit and Donald Trump’s election has been most potent in places with the least exposure to actual immigrants. This is, in a sense, a heartwarming suggestion, since it leaves open the possibility that minds can be changed by human interaction. But Bayonne, which voted for Hillary Clinton by a margin of three to two, is not at all like that. New Jersey has one of the highest proportions of Muslims of any state in the country, 3.3 per cent, and there are more than half a dozen mosques in Jersey City, which borders Bayonne. Newark, nearby, has a Muslim deputy mayor. The people who aired civilizational broadsides at the Bayonne zoning board were not talking about an unknowable religion half a world away, glimpsed only through cable news. They were talking about their neighbors.

While watching footage of the board meeting, it was hard not to notice the urgency among the mosque’s opponents, their sense that the hearing had presented a chance to make an essential stand. “You are our last hope,” one man told the zoning board. The applicants had selected an unobtrusive site for the proposed mosque. The building they wanted to convert was “an empty 8,500-square-foot warehouse at the end of a dead-end block,” as the Times put it. But it was in an area that was zoned for residential use, and so required a public variance to convert. The three members of the zoning board who blocked the variance suggested that they would be open to a mosque elsewhere in the city and that their concerns were about the particular neighborhood, but this was hard to square with the angry and expansive rhetoric from the project’s opponents.

Last week, the zoning board in Bayonne, New Jersey—just across New York Harbor from Sunset Park, Brooklyn—voted to deny a variance to Muslim residents who wanted to convert a warehouse into a mosque. The hearing had been moved to Bayonne High School, to accommodate a large crowd, and wound up lasting six hours. When a group of Muslims stood to pray as the meeting convened, a group of Christians stood “in response” and recited the Lord’s Prayer, according to the Times . At the microphone, one opponent of the proposed mosque asked the board to press its organizers on what they believed. Another read violent passages out of the Koran. One woman asked, “How many people have died because of this so-called religion?” There was testimony from Coptic Christians whose relatives had been murdered by Muslims in Egypt, and who wanted that violence kept away from Bayonne. The mosque’s supporters needed five votes, but they got only four. “The Muslim Brotherhood was brought up in this meeting, for chrissakes,” someone said early on. The great New Jersey political reporter Matt Katz, now of WNYC, pointed out that this countering of the grandiose with the profane was “the Jersey-est thing said so far.”

The number of hate crimes and bias incidents has probably increased since the election, especially in large cities. But it is a complicated log, in which some acts seem symbolic and others impulsive, some aimed at a national community and others much more personal. There have been so many threats phoned into Jewish community centers and synagogues (about a hundred and fifty since the election) that at first they seemed to represent a grassroots phenomenon. The intelligence now suggests that they are coördinated. Last Sunday, John Miller, the head of the N.Y.P.D.’s intelligence division, said on “CBS This Morning” that the threats appeared to be overwhelmingly the work of one man, using a device that changes his voice and another that makes it difficult for authorities to trace his number. (There have been a few copycats, Miller said, among them the St. Louis journalist Juan Thompson, who allegedly made eight threats as part of a plot to implicate his ex-girlfriend.) If Miller is right, then these threats might represent something less than a popular surge of anti-Semitism. “We have an offender with some technical prowess here,” Miller said. The intent in making so many threats seemed to be to terrorize; the perpetrator whom Miller described had some of the anonymous malevolence of the Internet troll.

In the week after the election, the Southern Poverty Law Center recorded about a hundred bias threats each day, but by early December that number had dropped to about half a dozen. Coming immediately after Trump’s surprise victory, the attacks, many of which took place at universities, suggested a bristling nationalist euphoria. At San Diego State University, a female student was robbed by men who “made comments about Donald Trump and the Muslim community”; at N.Y.U.’s engineering school, Muslim students awoke after the election to find that someone had scrawled “Trump!” on their dorm door; at San Jose State, a Muslim woman student reported that a “fair-skinned” man she did not know had yanked off her hijab, throwing off her balance and choking her. There was a personal quality to these encounters, and their targets seemed often to be Muslim-Americans within a particular community.

The most violent and disturbing hate crimes since the election have had more in common with these attacks than with the widespread threats against synagogues and mosques. In August, a Lebanese-American man named Khalid Jabara was killed on his doorstep by a white neighbor who had harassed the family for years, calling them “dirty Arabs.” On February 22nd, in a sports bar in Olathe, a Kansas City suburb, a Navy veteran named Adam Purinton confronted two Indian-born aerospace engineers at a bar and demanded to know their immigration status. Escorted from the bar, he returned half an hour later with a handgun and shot both men, killing one and injuring the other and a patron who tried to intervene. A few hours later, just before he was apprehended, Purinton told an acquaintance that he believed that the men were Iranian.

On March 3rd, in Kent, Washington, a stocky, masked white man walked up to a suburban driveway, where an Indian-American man named Deep Rai, a Sikh, was working on his car. The masked man told Rai to “go back to your own country” and shot him in the arm. On March 6th, an Indian-born man named Harnish Patel, a convenience-store owner, was fatally shot outside his house in Lancaster, South Carolina. In that case, investigators have disclosed so little that it isn’t clear that it was a hate crime at all.

If the emotion guiding these attacks was specifically anti-Muslim, or anti-Semitic, we would expect the targets to be more precisely chosen. Instead, although at least two of the four victims were assumed to be Muslim, none of them actually were. They were attacked not in places of worship but in suburban neighborhoods and a sports bar, where their attackers told them they did not belong. Unlike the calls to the Jewish community centers, the shootings do not seem to have been carefully planned to terrorize a particular group. If the assailants imagined themselves as martyrs, they might not have tried to escape, as all of them did. These shootings seem impulsive, not coördinated by any extremist group, and the idea they have advertised is simple: that outsiders are not welcome here.

Trump and the nationalist wing of the Republican Party have announced a great struggle (“Let’s Make Western Civilization Great Again!” the hardline Iowa congressman Steve King tweeted on Monday evening), but it is a struggle in which there is no obvious way for ordinary citizens to take part. National Guardsmen are not being sent to Raqqa; militias are not being summoned to the southern border. Some of this intensity has been displaced into local neighborhoods. One reason that the apocalyptic talk of civilizational struggle surfaced in the NIMBY theatre of a suburban zoning-board hearing may be that they share a common thread. They are efforts to exert local control.",1
"Two U.S. senators, two congressmen, one governor, and many state and local officials stood in the main gym of the Kaplen JCC on the Palisades in Tenafly on Friday morning, in a rally called by Robert Menendez (D-NJ) to condemn hatred in general and the rash of bomb threats against JCCs nationwide in particular.

“Antisemitism is not dead or dormant,” Mr. Menendez, a Democrat and New Jersey’s senior senator, lamented. “Whether it’s the defacement of property or the attempts at the delegitimization of the State of Israel, it’s incumbent to speak out against anti-Semitism.”

Mr. Menendez said that when he was in the New Jersey state legislature, he had written the state’s bias crime law.

“We cannot stop hatred in somebody’s heart, but bias laws sent a societal message that we do not tolerate crimes of hate,” he said. “Whether you are a Sikh who wears a turban, a Hindu who wears a bindi, a Muslim who wears a hijab, a Christian who wears a cross, or a Jew who wears a Star of David, together we understand that we are stronger than those who hate.”

He said that he will ask the administration and the Senate Appropriations Committee to double the number of homeland security grants awarded to non-profit organizations. The program gives $20 million in grants to non-profits so they can increase their security measures. Over the years, Jewish institutions have been the primary recipients of these grants.

“Let us stand up for tolerance,” Mr. Menendez said. “Today we say we are all Jews.”

Governor Chris Christie said the hate behind the bomb threats “is foreign to my experience in New Jersey. We are the most ethnically and religiously diverse state in the nation.”

It is not enough to condemn hate, the governor, a Republican, continued. “It is important to also speak out about the opposite side, how much this diversity makes us better. When we hear the awful remark we have to let the person know it’s unacceptable. It’s not good enough to wait for someone in authority to do something about it “If you want to be one of the 8.9 million people of New Jersey, one of the requirements is to love your neighbor as yourself.

“I hope we will speak out against all other forms of hate,” Mr. Christie added, noting that the Jewish community in fact has taken the lead in speaking out against all forms of hate.

“We are here in response to hate, and we are here in affirmation of love,” Cory Booker, the Democrat who is New Jersey’s junior U.S. senator, said. “We must be agents of hope.

“This is not a partisan issue. I call on all of us here that we will never let a hateful word be the last word. Let us go out from here not just to condemn hatred. Let us tell our truth as Americans, let people know that we are a nation that celebrates every one of our citizens.”

“The speech that inflames and instigates was not born overnight,” Bill Pascrell, the Democratic congressman who represents New Jersey’s ninth district, said. He noted that mosques have been burnt in Florida and Texas — and praised the Jewish community for coming to the aid of repairing the burnt mosques, “18 dollars at a time.”

He called for a “holistic, inclusive approach to counter violent extremism” and self-radicalization.

“These acts of violence do not happen in a vacuum,” he said. “This is why our words matter.”

Rookie Congressman Josh Gottheimer, the Democrat who represents New Jersey’s fifth district, talked about being “as scared as everyone else when I drop my son off at his Jewish preschool.

“This national trend is not by accident,” he said. “When you divide people up this is what happens.

“We can’t allow partisan gamesmanship to get in the way of protecting our children and families,” he added. “Our diversity is our greatest strength.”

State Senator Loretta Weinberger of Teaneck, that body’s majority leader, said that “I am so tired we have to continue this fight generation after generation.”

“On this issue, it was really a pleasure and an honor to be sharing the platform with the governor,” she added.",1

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) – The number of hate crimes committed in the United States rose in 2016 for the second consecutive year, with African-Americans, Jews and Muslims targeted in many of the incidents, the FBI said on Monday in an annual report.

There were 6,121 hate crime incidents recorded last year, an almost 5 percent rise from 2015 and a 10 percent increase from 2014, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Hate Crimes Statistics report said. It did not give a reason for the rise.

Black Americans were targeted in about half the 3,489 incidents based on race, ethnicity or ancestry, the report said, followed by whites who were targeted in 720.

About half the 1,273 incidents that involved religion were against Jews. Muslims were targeted in 307 religion-based crimes, up 19 percent from 2015 and double the number in 2014.

There were 1,076 incidents involving lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender people, with almost two-thirds of those targeting gay men.

The hate crimes recorded last year included nine murders and 24 rapes, the report said. Of the 5,770 known offenders, 46 percent were white and 26 percent were African-American.

The report was based on data voluntarily submitted by about 15,000 law enforcement agencies.

"Muslim groups in Iowa are asking authorities to investigate a hate-filled message that was left at a Des Moines mosque.

Local media outlets in Iowa have reported that the handwritten letter was dropped off at the Islamic Center of Des Moines. In it, Muslims were called “vile” and “filthy” and addressed as “Children of Satan.” The author also wrote that President Trump is “going to do to you Muslims what Hitler did to the Jews,” according to a report by Iowa’s KCCI. The author remains anonymous; the letter is signed “Americans for a Better Way.”

The Islamic Center’s spokesman Esam Boraey told the news organization the Muslim community is “circled and surrounded, and centered around the fear and our safety.” In an interview with USA Today, a member of the mosque’s board said the community is taking the note seriously.

“In this climate, we have to take these things seriously because it could escalate,” said Jamal Muhammad

The Executive Director of Iowa’s chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations called for an investigation in a statement released Sunday. “We call on state and federal law enforcement authorities to investigate this message of intimidation targeting a house of worship as a hate crime and to bring the perpetrator to justice,” said Miriam Amer.

Hateful attacks against Muslims have been on the rise, according to data from the FBI and Muslim and civil rights organizations have linked rise in attacks to the rhetoric of President Trump who called for the a “complete and total shutdown” of Muslims entering the country early in the campaign. He later walked that statement back, but many have interpreted his executive order temporarily banning travel from six majority-Muslim countries as a Muslim ban.",1
"A

French judge has dropped hate crime charges against Arab teenagers who allegedly assaulted a Jewish teenager outside a synagogue near Paris, a watchdog group said.

The National Bureau for Vigilance Against Anti-Semitism, or BNVCA, protested in a statement on Tuesday the omission from the indictment of the suspects in the Feb. 28 assault in Montmagny.

On Wednesday, French President Emmanuel Macron reiterated his intention to combat anti-Semitism in France, which he said was “returning” to society there in the proliferation of assaults on Jews and hate speech against them.

“There are hatreds that are rising again, there are the worse kinds of crimes,” Macron said at the annual dinner of the CRIF Jewish umbrella organization.

Jewish groups, including CRIF and BNVCA, have praised the French authorities efforts to protect Jews, but also criticized the judiciary’s perceived failure to address the aggravated element of hate crimes in several cases of violence against Jews.

In the Montmagny assault, the alleged attackers, aged 14 and 15, called the Jewish boy, his sister and brother “dirty Jews” at the park where they were playing, Le Parisien reported, based on police sources. According to BNVCA, all four suspects are of Arab descent. The boy said the assailants beat him with a stick and took away his kippah, which he was wearing when they approached him.

BNVCA said it was “dismayed” by the judge’s decision, which the group said runs “totally contrary” to the law.

In recent months, BNVCA has also criticized a judge’s initial omission of hate crime charges from the murder trial of a Muslim man who confessed to killing his Jewish neighbor in April while screaming about Allah and calling her a demon. The hate crime charge ultimately was added to the indictment.

A similar exchange occurred after French prosecutors last year dropped hate crime charges in the case of four men suspected of rape and robbery at a suburban Paris home they acknowledged was targeted because it belonged to Jews. Following protests, the aggravated element also was added to their indictment.",1
"Attacking a cop or judge in Texas is about to become a hate crime, after state lawmakers sent Gov. Greg Abbott a bill is all but sure to sign – since he was the first to propose it.

The soon-to-be law, inspired by the July 2016 murders of five police officers in Dallas, increases the punishment for crimes against peace officers. It cleared the state Senate this week by a 30-1 vote and already passed the House.

“The men and women in uniform risk their lives every day to protect the public, and it is time we show them the State of Texas has their back,” Abbott said nearly a year ago, after the assassination of five cops working to protect protesters at an anti-police brutality march.

It was the deadliest day for American law enforcement officers since 9/11.

KENTUCKY BECOMES 2ND STATE TO PASS A BLUE LIVES MATTER BILL

The bill now headed for Abbott’s desk says that penalties for threatening peace officers or judges will be raised from a misdemeanor to a felony, punishable by 180 days to two years in prison. This likens the punishment to offenses based on crimes against groups identified by race, disability, religion, ancestry, age, gender or sexual preference.

Unlawfully restraining or assaulting a police officer or judge would be a second-degree felony, which carries a prison sentence of up to 20 years. Any crime against either group that results in serious bodily injury would be a first-degree felony, punishable by up to 99 years or life in prison.

Judges were added to the bill as an answer to help protect people like Texas District Judge Julie Kocurek, who was shot four times outside her home in Austin in 2015. She survived the attack.

KENTUCKY BECOMES 2ND STATE TO PASS A BLUE LIVES MATTER BILL

If signed by Abbott, as expected, the bill will go into effect on Sept. 1. The governor did not respond to requests for comment by Fox News, but recently tweeted an article about the bill’s passing, adding #backtheblue.

“I think this legislation is a long time coming in a time when we have basically a war on cops. These bills are needed,” Jim Fotis, president of The National Center for Police Defense, a non-profit dedicated to helping law enforcement officers during difficult times, told Fox News. “Certainly police officers are out there to do their job and they shouldn’t have to worry every single day about somebody targeting them.”

Fotis, however, said he wasn’t sure whether the legislation will be a deterrent.

“Words certainly aren’t going to stop some people, but if you are a sane person, hopefully this will make you think twice before you go after law enforcement,” Fotis said, adding that he thinks this is a good first step but he would like to see broader, federal legislation someday.

FOUR MEN ARRESTED IN ATTACK ON ALABAMA TEEN WHO SAID BLUE LIVES MATTER

The bill, known as the “Blue Lives Matter Act of 2016 and is similar to the Texas legislation, was proposed in Congress last year but no action has been taken on it.

Critics say that the proposal goes against the intent of a hate came because police officers were not born being cops. And, they say, there are already tough laws in place to prosecute crimes against cops.

“Police are provided many protections already. We arm them and grant them great leeway in use of deadly force. We protect them with body armor and other gear,” said an editorial in the Denver Post published last year. “Rarely do juries or review panels charge officers who kill alleged offenders, but the justice system comes down extra hard when one of its own meets with harm.”

Similar bills are being passed, or at least proposed, in other areas of the country. At least two states, Kentucky and Louisiana, have passed the “Blue Lives Matter” law, which makes attacking a police officer a hate crime.

On May 9, the New York State Senate passed the “Community Heroes Protection Act” to designate “offenses against law enforcement officers, firefighters and emergency medical services personnel as hate crimes.” And, in Alabama this week, State Rep. John Rogers, a Democrat, asked the Alabama House to do the same.

“It is a hate crime,” Rogers said to WBRC Fox6 in Birmingham, “because it attacks a certain class of individuals: police officers.”",1

"UPDATE: Police say teen beating in Florida was over a boy, not a hate crime

The Palm Beach County Sheriffs Office have determined that the brutal beating of a 14-year-old girl near West Boca High School is not a hate crime.

"After LeBron James invoked Emmett Till’s name when commenting on the recent hate crime committed against his home, some critics questioned whether his statements were appropriate and accurately described the nature of the situation. But Till’s living cousin, Deborah Watts, doesn’t see anything wrong with James using her family’s name. In fact, she applauded him for his bravery in speaking about the sensitive topic.

“I don’t understand the criticism. What he did in using his platform was very, very powerful, and I really appreciate his courage,” Watts told TMZ on June 7. Watts did clarify a few points in regards to the difference between Emmett Till’s death and the crime committed against James however. “Is it lynching the way Emmett was murdered and killed? No. Was it a part of an environment that created an opportune time for people to feel like they could do it? Yes.”

While some may not have agreed with Lebron likening his recent incident of racism to that of 14-year-old Till’s – who was brutally murdered while visiting family in Mississippi in the summer of 1955 – the Cleveland Cavaliers player made some powerful points about being African American in today’s society. “Racism will always be part of the world, part of America, and hate in America, especially for African Americans, is living every day,” James stated during his post-game press conference on May 31. “No matter how much money you have, no matter how famous you are, no matter how many people admire you, being black in America is tough. We’ve got a long way to go for us as a society and for us as African Americans until we feel equal in America.”

Light from an iPad screen glowed on Rabbi Howard Nacht’s face as he recounted recent anti-Semitic hate crimes on Long Island and across the country to a hushed crowd of 100 Wantagh, Seaford, Bellmore, East Meadow and Levittown residents on Saturday. They stood in circle around a flagpole on the lawn of Wantagh Memorial Congregational Church on a cool evening, peering through the darkness at Nacht. Some edged closer to hear his prayer.

The group fell silent when Nacht repeated a chant that white supremacists shouted on Aug. 11 as they marched to a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E Lee in Charlottesville, Va., the night before a scheduled Unite the Right rally: “Jews will not replace us.” Nacht paused before raising his voice over the low hum of cicadas.

“These things, and these thugs, do everything,” he said, his voice growing louder “Everything that is destructive to the fundamental values of the United States of America. They did this openly, without masks and hoods, as though this was acceptable, everyday behavior.

“It is not, my friends,” he continued. “It is not.”

Faith leaders from across five communities also offered their reflections on the violence in Charlottesville and hate crimes across the nation at the Wantagh Clergy Council’s interfaith vigil. Group members said that they organized the event to show that hate, bigotry and prejudice have no place in their communities and the country.

The Rev. Christopher Hofer, rector of the Church of St. Jude, in Wantagh, and vicar of St. Michael and All Angels, in Seaford, said that residents of all faiths and walks of life were welcome to attend the peaceful gathering, noting that Long Island is becoming more diverse every year.

“All of our area congregations and respective religions denounce neo-Nazis, white supremacists, the KKK and any group that promotes intolerance instead of love,” Hofer said. “By coming together in prayer, we show those who wish to promote a hate-filled agenda that there is no room for hate in our communities.”

The Wantagh Clergy Council comprises St. Jude’s, St. Michael’s, B’Nai Torah, Wantagh Memorial Congregational, Congregation Beth Tikvah, St. Frances de Chantal Roman Catholic Church, St. Markella Greek Orthodox Church, Christ Lutheran Church of Wantagh, Bellmore Presbyterian Church, First Presbyterian Church of Levittown and Temple Emanu-El of East Meadow.

Rabbi Daniel Bar-Nahum, Temple Emanu-El’s spiritual leader, said that he and his congregants took part in the vigil to embrace the values that unite people of different faiths — justice, love and compassion. “I think that’s what God wants us to do,” he said. “So much right now seems to be about pointedly trying to divide us and to split us apart and to highlight all of our differences. When we can come together as neighbors to say that we stand for justice, American values and values of many faiths, that’s important.”

The Rev. Ron Garner, pastor of Wantagh Memorial Congregational, said he thinks more people turn to their churches when they see bigotry and violence in the news. He noted that the Wantagh Clergy Council members thought residents might seek comfort and guidance after the Unite the Right rally, at which Heather Heyer, who was protesting against white supremacy, was killed.

Garner led the ceremony by asking attendees to sing the national anthem and recite the Pledge of Allegiance. He encouraged them to be agents of reconciliation and instruments of peace.

MaryJean Murphy, who has lived in Wantagh for 52 years, agreed that residents must spread peace. She knocked on neighbors’ doors with her friends, encouraging them to come to the vigil.

“If we don’t protest all of this violence and hatred in the world, then it won’t stop,” she said. “Change has to come from us — the little people.”

Murphy and her friends — Isabel Gavilan, Aileen Scott and Mary Quidore — heard about the vigil at a Mass at St. Frances. While they waited to receive candles for the service, Scott and Quidore shook their heads while talking about how uncivilized they thought the Unite the Right attendees were.

Gavilan, who moved to the U.S. from Cuba in 1969 and has since earned American citizenship, said she was familiar with how prejudice and political rhetoric can divide families and communities. Hatred, she said, is sometimes buried in people’s hearts.

“I think that, maybe for many years, everything has been kept inside,” Gavilan said. “As Americans, we have to do a lot of thinking about ourselves and what we’re leaving to our children and grandchildren and young people. That’s what I worry about the most — what we’re passing on to them.”",1
"The trial of Michael Thomas, the former chairman of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation who is accused of stealing more than $100,000 from the tribe, begins Monday. Patch reported earlier that, federal investigators charge that Michael Thomas stole more than $100,000 while serving as the chairman of the tribal council. According to the United States Attorneys Office, The indictments also include forfeiture allegations.  If convicted Michael Thomas faces forfeiture of $102,393.34 and two personal computers. Federal prosecutors are concerned that Thomas will blame his former accountant, F. Robert LaSaracina of Norwich, for his alleged offense. The Day reported that LaSaracina pled guilty in 2011 to federal fraud and tax charges and hes serving a 63-month prison term. The report also says that Thomas may use an everybody-is-doing-it defense and offer evidence that other tribal members used the tribe issued credit card for personal expenses. Prosecutors claim that Thomas charged Direct TV satellite service, cell phone service and personal transportation costs to the card, according to another report on The Day. Thomas brother Steven Thomas also faces trial for similar charges but his trial wont begin until November. Federal prosecutors allege that Steven Thomas stole more than $700,000 while he was assistant director of the natural resources department and if convicted he faces forfeiture of approximately $739,743.64, and two personal computers.

"In January of 2016, the home of a prominent atheist professor in Jerusalem was vandalized. The apparent hate crime was committed, it seemed, by a religious zealot who wanted to stop him from destroying the faith of the Israeli people.

Professor Yaakov Malkin is a leader of Tmura, the Israeli affiliate of the International Institute for Humanistic Secular Judaism. He’s been a secular activist for the past 50 years, and an organizational leader for the past 20. His group trains Secular Humanistic rabbis to serve the many, many Jewish people who don’t identify primarily as religious.

Malkin’s home was defaced with Bible-verse graffiti, a knife, and a threatening note:

A Star of David and the phrases “Psalms 139: 21-24” and “Destruction of Amalek” were scrawled on the fence surrounding his home. A knife and an envelope containing a threatening letter were also found at the scene, reading “a Jew whose hands are bloody resides in your street. This Jew received a severe warning.” The letter to Malkin said, among other things, that “this is a warning for you to immediately end all atheist and heretic activity that you take part in or lead. You must absolutely and immediately stop your actions to dismiss and incite the people of Israel from their God.” “Should you continue your actions following this warning, know that you are yourself choosing to forsake your fate and future. Do not cross the line. This isn’t a futile warning, it is completely and absolutely serious, treat it as one. You will not receive another warning,” it said. The letter was signed, “your brother who brings to you the word of God your creator and king, the father still waiting for your return to him.”

The people of Amalek are considered enemies of Israel in the Bible.

The threatening note also included a reference to Exodus 16:14, though that appeared to be a mistake:

The reference from Exodus seems to be a mistake, as the corresponding passage describes the manna given by God to feed the Israelites during their travels in the desert. The graffiti is most likely referring to the same verse in chapter 17, which expounds on the edict to destroy the Amalekites.

The vandal couldn’t even get his Bible references right…

That vandal didn’t just go after Malkin. The same person appears to have been committing crimes against other atheists and non-Orthodox Jews over the past three years.

But now it may be over.

The Times of Israel reports that an arrest was finally made this week:

A 39-year-old Israeli man from the center of the country was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of vandalizing a Reform synagogue in Ra’anana and leaving threatening notes outside the Jerusalem home of a prominent Israeli ethicist and atheist. … The suspect was arrested outside his home in central Israel on Tuesday morning. His residence, along with his mother’s home, were subject to a police search.

There are no more details about the arrest available, but let’s hope this puts an end to the crimes. No one deserves to live in fear because he dares hold an unpopular opinion.

Sleeper was accused of issuing threats this past winter against staff and patrons of Sidetrack nightclub in Boystown, allegedly threatening to perpetrate a shooting on a scale like that of the Pulse nightclub incident in Orlando. He was being held in Cook County Jail and faced a number of misdemeanor charges. Prosecutors presented a number of new felony charges, comprising some 10 different cases, on May 1.

"When a car plowed into a crowd of protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, last summer, killing activist Heather Heyer, the public understandably responded with outrage and horror: An increase in conservative extremism had finally led to a violent rally, including a fatality.

Nearly a year later, the driver responsible for Heyer’s death will finally face the consequences. He’s received hate crimes charges, which enhance the potential penalties he may receive if convicted — and send a clear message to the public: White supremacy is an act of violence.

Heyer died in August of 2017 while counter-protesting a white supremacist “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville when James Alex Fields, Jr. deliberately drove his vehicle into a crowd. Fields, according to the indictment, very clearly decided to run his car into the group of counter-protesters, only stopping when his vehicle hit another car.

Images from the scene are harrowing, showing people desperately struggling to get away in the packed conditions. Ryan M. Kelly notably won a Pulitzer for his photograph of the incident. It was never in dispute that Heyer’s death and the many other injuries were the result of an intentional action.

The question was: Did it amount to a hate crime?

A federal grand jury says it did, charging Fields with murder, 28 counts of “hate crime acts causing injury” and another count of “racially motivated interference with a federally protected activity.” Fields, they say, deliberately targeted members of the diverse crowd on the basis of their race, and he has a long history of racial animus, including expressing white supremacist attitudes on social media and sending threatening messages. Heyer, a white activist dedicated to anti-racism, happened to take the brunt of his hatred.

One of the counts is death penalty eligible, though it’s unclear whether prosecutors will seek that option. Others could result in a life sentence.

If convicted, in other words, it’s likely Fields could spend a long time in jail. Indictment under hate crimes charges comes with much stricter penalties than the charges he was already facing, and some argue that these enhanced penalties serve as a deterrent. While these laws are rarely deployed, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the indictment signaled that the United States would “aggressively prosecute crimes of hate” in the United States.

Those celebrating the indictment may want to be aware that not all marginalized communities support hate crimes legislation and the use of enhanced penalties in cases like these. The Sylvia Rivera Law Project, for example, argues that in a judicial climate plagued with profiling, these laws can be turned against the very people they are supposed to protect, and they may result in increased incarceration rates for some people, especially in low-income black and Latinx communities. Some groups focused on prison reform, especially abolition, would like to see other avenues of justice pursued.

Whatever your stance on these laws, the recognition that this assault was a hate crime is an important moment in a climate where escalating tensions are fueling white supremacy and violence. Whether the Justice Department will make good on its assertion to aggressively address these issues, however, remains to be seen.

During the search, the sheriffs office said, they found a loaded, semi-automatic pistol in her purse. The purse was on the floor of her classroom, underneath Bullards desk.

"CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- A reputed Hitler admirer accused of plowing a car into a crowd of protesters in Charlottesville, killing a young woman, was charged Wednesday with federal hate crimes in a case arising from the white nationalist rally that stirred accusations President Donald Trump was emboldening racists.

James Alex Fields Jr., who already faced murder and other charges under Virginia law, was indicted on 30 additional federal charges stemming from the 2017 attack that killed 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injured dozens of others who had gathered to protest the white nationalists.

At the Department of Justice, we remain resolute that hateful ideologies will not have the last word and that their adherents will not get away with violent crimes against those they target, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. Last summers violence in Charlottesville cut short a promising young life and shocked the nation.

With his statement and the decision to bring the charges, Sessions struck a sharply different tone than the president, who sparked an uproar last year when he blamed the violence at the rally on both sides.

Described by a former teacher as having a keen interest in Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler, Fields allegedly drove his speeding car into a group of people demonstrating against the Unite the Right rally. The Aug. 12 event drew hundreds of white nationalists to the college town, where officials planned to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.

The car attack came after the rally had descended into chaos, with brawling breaking between white nationalists and counterdemonstrators. Authorities then forced the crowd to disband.

Fields, 21, of Maumee, Ohio, has been in custody since the attack. Prosecutor Joseph Platania said in a statement that the federal indictment would have no effect on the pending state case.

The attorney representing Fields on those counts declined to comment.

The eight-page indictment alleges Fields decided to attend the rally on or before Aug. 8. As he prepared to leave for Charlottesville, a family member sent him a text message urging him to be careful.

Fields replied, Were not the ones who need to be careful, and attached an image of Hitler, according to the indictment, which also says Fields used social media to promote racist views, including support for the Holocaust.

At the rally, he engaged in chants promoting white supremacy and other racist and anti-Semitic views, the indictment said.

After the crowd broke up, Fields drove his car toward the area where a racially and ethnically diverse crowd had gathered to protest, the indictment said.

He rapidly accelerated, through a stop sign and across a raised pedestrian mall, and drove directly into the crowd, it said.

Surveillance footage from a Virginia State Police helicopter monitoring the event captured the moment of impact by the car and showed the vehicle as it reversed and drove away. It was pulled over a relatively short time later.

The indictment includes charges under two hate crime statutes, including the one under which Dylann Roof was prosecuted for the 2015 killings of nine black parishioners at a church in Charleston, South Carolina.

A single count was brought under a provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. That charges accuses Fields of racially motivated violent interference with a federally protected activity -- in this case, the use of the public streets and sidewalks of Charlottesville. The charge is death-penalty eligible, although that decision has not yet been made, U.S. Attorney Thomas Cullen said.

The federal case is not the first to be filed by Sessions Justice Department, but it is certainly the highest-profile one. Critics of Sessions have aired concerns for the last year about what they see as less aggressive enforcement of civil rights laws and the departments lack of intervention with police departments that have troubled relationships with minorities.

Kristen Clarke, a former hate crimes prosecutor and president of the liberal Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said in a statement that her group was pleased the with federal indictment but that more work remains to be done to address the countrys growing hate crime crisis.

Silence on the part of Sessions was simply not an option because the Charlottesville rally stands as one of the most violent hate rallies to be carried out in this country in recent time, she said.

No date has been set yet for Fields initial appearance in federal court, said Brian McGinn, a spokesman for Cullen.",1
"RESTON, VA — Police have arrested a man after he hounded a man both inside and outside a Reston restaurant before attacking him and a good Samaritan who stepped in to help Thursday night, according to a report from the Fairfax County Police Department. Police say that at around 9 p.m. in the 2300 block of Hunter Woods Plaza, the victim was getting food at a nearby restaurant when a man walked up to him and asked for money, the report states. The victim refused and went into the restaurant, and the man followed, again asking for money until the victim left the restaurant. In the parking lot, the suspect then grabbed the victim and tried to steal his jewelry, the report states. Someone came to help the victim and was punched by the suspect, who left the area, police say. Police arrested 40-year-old Akeem Wauran Gale of Reston. He was taken to the Adult Detention Center.

"Attorneys for the man charged with murder and a hate crime in the fatal stabbing of a black student visiting the University of Maryland last year have asked a judge to bar evidence linking him to a now-deleted Facebook page called “Alt-Reich: Nation.”

Sean Urbanski’s attorneys are arguing that the content from the Facebook page, along with other “particularly offensive” evidence discovered — ­including a group message with survey questions on his phone and cartoon images — is “not relevant” and not connected to the killing of Richard Collins III.

[Salutes and a folded flag at funeral for Bowie State student killed in possible hate crime]

In a motion filed in Prince George’s County Court, William C. Brennan Jr. and John M. McKenna wrote that they believe “the state intends to offer the images, the survey and the Facebook page into evidence at the trial of this case. Those images, survey and Facebook page are particularly offensive, extremely prejudicial, highly inflammatory, irrelevant and not otherwise admissible.”

Collins was visiting friends May 20 at U-Md. in College Park when Urbanski is alleged to have stabbed him in what police call a “totally unprovoked” attack.

Collins and two friends were waiting for an Uber ride at a bus stop around 3 a.m. when Urbanski, now 23, approached and said, “Step left, step left if you know what’s best for you,” according to police charging papers.

Collins would not move, police said. Urbanski then stabbed Collins with a folding knife before fleeing the scene, police said.

Collins, 23, had just been commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army and was days away from graduating from Bowie State University when he was killed.

[Visiting student killed in stabbing attack at University of Maryland]

John Erzen, a spokesman for the Prince George’s County State’s Attorney’s Office, declined to comment on the defense motion until a hearing set for Thursday in which a judge will consider it.

The evidence Urbanski’s lawyers seek to bar from trial would appear to have a key role in whether prosecutors can prove to a jury that Collins’s slaying was racially motivated.

When announcing the hate crime charge against Urbanski in October, Prince George’s State’s Attorney Angela D. Alsobrooks said a review of Urbanski’s phone and social media activity led investigators to conclude that Urbanski, who is white, attacked Collins because of Collins’s race.

Urbanski’s attorneys said, “There is absolutely no temporal nexus between the proffered evidence and the killing of Mr. Richard Collins on May 20, 2017.”

Urbanski’s lawyers, who at previous hearings said drugs and alcohol may have played a role in the case, also argued Friday that the evidence they seek to bar would mislead the jury and confuse the issues.

“There is a genuine risk that the emotions of the jury concerning the cartoon images on the cell phone, the text message survey and the Facebook posting will be excited to irrational behavior concerning the alleged murder of Mr. Collins,” Urbanski’s attorneys said in the motion. “The proffered evidence is more shocking than the underlying crime.”

Urbanski’s lawyers asked that if the judge rules the evidence can be used, that there be separate trials for the murder and hate crime charges.

A trial has been scheduled for July.",1
"COLUMBUS – Columbus police say they have no evidence to suggest a neighborhood fight, which ended with a white woman tased and a Somali woman punched in the face, constituted a hate crime but a group that advocates for Muslims wants it investigated as one.

“There is no evidence at this time suggesting the incident involved any type of bias which would constitute the incident being investigated as a hate crime,” police spokesman Sgt. Rich Weiner said in a statement released Monday.

CAIR-Columbus Seeks Hate Crime Probe, Arrest of Suspect Following Beating of Ohio… https://t.co/3V0fyKCCDM pic.twitter.com/IELOT5LMM3 — CAIR-Columbus (@CAIR_Columbus) June 5, 2017



The incident began with allegations of a child being abused and a possible kidnapping at 9:21 p.m. Saturday, June 3, when a 911 caller told a dispatcher a woman was making threats to the caller, accusing her of having the woman’s child, and hitting the child with a shoe.

A separate call from another person stated someone had kidnapped her son because they saw her hitting her son, and claiming that she had been punched in the face.

In a call at 9:33, a woman is heard threatening someone with a Taser, followed by sounds of a struggle and what maybe the sound of a Taser being deployed. A witness calls three minutes later and describes the scene.

NOTE: Audio in this article contains sounds of violence that may be disturbing to some listeners

According to representatives from the Columbus chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a third woman, who reportedly intervened to protect a Somali woman from a white man – apparently the husband of a woman identified by WBNS 10-TV as Samantha Morales, who had been hit with the Taser — was beaten unconscious, resulting in facial fractures and the loss of several teeth.

The victim, identified by the television station as Rahma Warsame, claims the alleged attacker screamed “you all will be shipped back to Africa” prior to hitting her, according to CAIR, whose attorneys are representing Warsame.

Officers arrived at the scene and found a woman lying face down in the doorway of 2800 Pinellas Court and a man identifying himself as her husband standing nearby who told officers she had been assaulted with some kind of device similar to a Taser, Weiner said.

A man identifying himself as Ricky Boice, had told a dispatcher the same thing a few minutes earlier.

Weiner says officers also saw a woman sitting on the steps of 2806 Pinellas Court bleeding from her mouth.

She informed officers she had been assaulted by Boice, who was detained at the scene but not charged, according to Weiner.

“The fact that the perpetrator was not taken into custody and was not charged raises serious concerns and sends a very dangerous message,” said Jennifer Nimer, executive director of CAIR-Columbus and one of the attorneys for the victim. “We are asking law enforcement to investigate this as a hate crime and to bring the perpetrator to justice immediately before he commits another act of violence.”

After interviewing multiple victims and witnesses at the scene, Weiner said no arrests were made.

Faced with a lack of physical evidence and conflicting stories by parties at the scene, Weiner says officers were unable to determine who the primary aggressor was in the incident.

Two women were transported to area hospitals for injuries which Weiner said did not rise beyond the level of a misdemeanor assault.

The parties were referred to the City Prosecutor’s Office, which Weiner says is standard protocol when probable cause for an arrest cannot be established.",1
"Makeup brand L’Oréal made the waves in the news this week after it hired Munroe Bergdorf to represent the company as its first transgender model. L’Oréal has since fired her for making racist comments on social media.

Both the brand and Bergdorf received considerable coverage in the press for their latest campaign in the UK, which was designed to be attractive and inclusive to transgender and non-white women. However, the company soured on the model after she posted decidedly unattractive and uninclusive remarks about white people.

On Thursday, the UK’s Daily Mail published details of statements Bergdorf had written on her public-facing Facebook page following the events in Charlottesville, Va. The transgender model, who appeared alongside Cheryl Cole and Katie Piper, called out the “racial violence” of white people.

“Honestly, I don’t have energy to talk about racial violence of white people any more. Yes ALL white people,” she wrote (emphasis is Bergdorf’s). “Because most of ya’ll don’t even realize or refuse to acknowledge that your existence, privilege and success as a race is built on the backs, blood and death of people of color. Your entire existence is drenched in racism. From micro-aggressions to terrorism, you guys built the blueprint for this shit.”

“Come see me when you realize that racism isn’t learned, it’s inherited and consciously or unconsciously passed down through privilege,” she continued. “Once white people begin to admit that their race is the most violent and oppressive force of nature on Earth … then we can talk.”

Many of its customers expressed anger at her blanket statements about white people and took their complaints directly to the company. Following considerable outrage, L’Oréal dropped the model.

The company scrubbed Bergdorf’s campaign from its official YouTube page and severed all ties to her. It also released a statement.

“L’Oréal supports diversity and tolerance towards all people irrespective of their race, background, gender and religion. The L’Oréal Paris True Match campaign is a representation of these values and we are proud of the diversity of the Ambassadors who represent this campaign.”

“We believe that the recent comments by Munroe Bergdorf are at odds with those values, and as such we have taken the decision to end the partnership with her. L’Oréal remains committed to celebrating diversity and breaking down barriers in beauty.”

Bergdorf has since lashed out against L’Oréal, as well as the Daily Mail, for calling out her rant. She claims that her words were “taken out of context.” In a Facebook post, Bergdorf demanded L’Oréal address the underlying reasons for why people like her are underrepresented in the fashion industry.

Websites like BuzzFeed, The Fader and The Independent are now calling for Bergdorf to claim that L’Oréal’s decision to fire her is proof of the existence of white supremacy.

"The man accused of killing a woman when he plowed a car into a crowd of people protesting a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, now faces federal hate crime charges.

The Department of Justice announced that an indictment returned Wednesday charges James Alex Fields Jr., 21, of Maumee, Ohio, with 30 crimes, including one count of a hate crime resulting in the death of Heather Heyer, and 28 other hate crimes involving an attempt to kill dozens of other people who were injured. Another charge accuses him of “racially motivated violent interference.”

“Last summer’s violence in Charlottesville cut short a promising young life and shocked the nation,” U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. “Today’s indictment should send a clear message to every would-be criminal in America that we aggressively prosecute violent crimes of hate that threaten the core principles of our nation.”

Authorities have said Fields, described by a former teacher as having a keen interest in Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler, drove his speeding car into a group of people demonstrating against the “Unite the Right” rally Aug. 12 that drew hundreds of white nationalists to the college town, where officials planned to remove a Confederate monument.

Fields already faces state charges including first-degree murder and is set to face a jury trial later this year. He has been in custody since the rally. The attorney representing Fields on those counts couldn’t immediately be reached for comment Wednesday.

The car attack came after the rally had descended into chaos — with violent brawling between attendees and counterdemonstrators — and authorities had forced the crowd to disband.

The eight-page indictment alleges Fields decided to attend the rally on or before Aug. 8. As he prepared to leave to travel to Charlottesville, a family member sent him a text message urging him to be careful, the indictment said.

Fields replied, “We’re not the ones who need to be careful,” and attached an image of Adolf Hitler, according to the indictment, which also says Fields used social media to promote racist views.

Fields then attended the rally Aug. 12, engaging in chants promoting white supremacist and other racist and anti-Semitic views, the indictment said.

After authorities forced the crowd to disband, Fields drove his car toward the area where a “racially and ethnically diverse crowd” had gathered to protest, the indictment said.

“Fields rapidly accelerated, through a stop sign and across a raised pedestrian mall, and drove directly into the crowd,” it said.

In a statement, FBI Special Agent in Charge Adam S. Lee of the Richmond Division thanked the business owners and Charlottesville residents who he said “worked with us and provided a massive volume of evidence in this case.”

The federal civil rights case is not the first under Sessions’ Justice Department, but it is certainly the most high-profile one. Critics of Sessions for the last year have been concerned about what they see as less aggressive enforcement of federal civil rights laws, and especially the Justice Department’s lack of intervention against local police agencies with troubled relationships with minorities.

But in bringing the prosecution, Sessions appeared to assert himself as independent from President Donald Trump — who blamed the violence on both sides and was accused of emboldening racists — and suggested that the Justice Department would continue to treat racially motivated acts of violence as hate crimes.",1

"ARCADIA, CA — Los Angeles County Firefighters, along with relatives, colleagues and friends gathered Friday to honor the life of a Los Angeles firefighter who died two days after falling from a ladder during a training exercise. Kelly Wong, 29, fell about six stories from the Los Angeles Fire Department aerial ladder while participating in an exercise in downtown Los Angeles on June 3. He died at a hospital. A procession began about 8 a.m. at Main and First streets, led by an LAFD fire truck bearing the casket, followed by an honor guard and hundreds of mourners who walked north on Main Street and then heading west on Temple Street to the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels for a celebration of life service, which began about 9 a.m. and ended shortly before 11 a.m. He was a big guy with a big heart, LAFD Capt. Erik Scott said. LAFD Chief Ralph Terrazas and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti were among the mourners. More than 1,000 uniformed personnel from law enforcement and firefighting organizations from numerous jurisdictions were on hand for the memorial. We are here today in this city of angels to celebrate the life of an angel, Garcetti told the mourners. Celebrating -- each one of us -- the courage and the hopes that we have, and to feel for a moment this love that surrounds us. To Kellys family, I know you feel only sad and dull right now. I think all of us feel a piece of that, but you more deeply than anybody. But I hope you, too, also feel what love this has unleashed, an uncontrollable love, a love that has no limit; a love that encompasses the reflection of four million grateful people and beyond; the brotherhood and sisterhood of firefighters everywhere; the first responders; and of this city which depends on the courage and -- depended on the courage of Kelly for us to live the lives that we do, Garcetti said. Terrazas said he had addressed Wongs graduating class of firefighters two years earlier, telling them that they were going to become members of a second family. Kelly Wong was a man who loved his family, his friends, and the fire service, Terrazas said. And though he was only with us for a short time frame, he truly loved the Los Angeles Fire Department, and our department truly loved him.Following his remarks, Terrazas presented Wongs service badge to his wife Danielle. Wong, a two-year veteran, was assigned to Fire Station 92 in Rancho Park. He had been scheduled to transfer to Fire Station 9 serving downtown Los Angeles and Skid Row on June 12 and was working at that station at the time of the accident. Wong graduated from the LAFD Recruit Academy on Terminal Island in August 2015 and was the top academic performer in his class. Kellys dream since he was a little boy was to be a firefighter, Terrazas has said. His mother, Ann, shared that story with me that Kelly liked to play with fire trucks growing up. He applied with several departments but he wanted to work for the best. He wanted to work for the Los Angeles Fire Department. And he accomplished his goal. Wong is survived by his wife Danielle; his infant son Colton; his mother Ann; his mother-in-law and father-in-law Barbara and Michael Quinlan; and his sisters-in-law Nicole and Stephanie. A private burial in Orange County was to follow the service. Terrazas said the type of training in which Wong was killed will continue.When Kelly was injured, the crew at Fire Station 9 was training, and I always tell our people that the first thing, the most important thing that we do is respond to emergencies, Terrazas said earlier. The second most important thing we do is train to respond to emergencies. We will continue to train whether it be for a high-rise fire, a brush fire, a medical event, whatever incident type it is, we will continue to train to be ready so we can protect the people of this great city.The LAFD, in conjunction with state safety agencies, is conducting an investigation into the circumstances of Wongs death. Several streets were closed Friday morning in the area to accommodate the procession and service. OCFA Photo",0
"LONG HILL, NJ — A Long Hill man has pled guilty to distributing child pornography after over 138,000 images were found on his computer, NJ Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal announced. William G. Camargo, 48, of Long Hill Township was arrested as part of Operation Safety Net, a multi-agency child pornography sweep last year. He pled guilty in Superior Court on Tuesday in a plea agreement; he is expected to be sentenced to six years in jail, and will have to register as a sex offender.. Camargo, an IT professional, hosted and shared child porn through a shared online folder, Grewal said. A Sept. 2017 search of his home and hard drives turned up 138,000 images of child pornography, and an additional 1.3 million files that have yet to be examined. Its not known how many of those files contain illegial images. Each time we arrest an offender like Camargo who has amassed a collection of tens of thousands of files of child pornography, it starkly reveals the extent of the market for these loathsome materials and the vast number of children who are cruelly abused and exploited, said Grewal. We will continue to devote the resources necessary to apprehend these offenders and send them to prison. Carmargo was one of 79 arrested last September in a large-scale operation. The operation was lead by the New Jersey Regional Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force of the New Jersey State Police, and involved the New Jersey Division of Criminal Justice, U.S. Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), all 21 County Prosecutors Offices, and numerous local police departments. We will continue to patrol the internet and conduct multi-agency investigations to arrest and prosecute offenders like Camargo who distribute child pornography, said Director Veronica Allende of the Division of Criminal Justice. We are determined to seek justice for the children who are victimized to create these repugnant materials and who are re-victimized perpetually on the internet. It is a sad fact that each year countless children around the world fall prey to sexual predators, their innocence forever stolen and exploited through these disturbing digital collections, said Brian Michael, Acting Special Agent in Charge, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Newark. The expert investigative skills that HSI brings to the forefront, in collaboration with our partner agencies, helped close the loop on this individual, and took a dangerous predator off the street and brought him to much deserved justice.

"The University of Maryland Police Department has identified the victim in a fatal stabbing which occurred on campus early Saturday morning, and said they are investigating racially-based hate as a possible motive.

Second Lt. Richard Wilbur Collins III, 23, was fatally stabbed by University of Maryland student and Severna Park resident Sean Urbanski early Saturday morning, police said. Urbanski has been charged with first- and second-degree murder, as well as first degree assault. He is being held without bond, officials said. Collins was a student at Bowie State visiting friends who attended the University of Maryland, police said.

Collins, of Calvert County, was scheduled to graduate with a degree in business from Bowie State University Tuesday, and was commissioned May 18 to join the United States Army. He was involved with Bowie States ROTC chapter, police said.

Darryl L. Godlock, a pastor who was serving as a spokesman for the Collins family, said the young man had obtained his airborne certification. Collins wanted to follow in the footsteps of his father, a military veteran, Godlock said.

He wanted to make his parents proud of him so he went into the military to serve his country, Godlock said. It was a great opportunity for him to advance forward and make the most out of his career.

Police also provided additional details about the incident at the news conference Sunday night, including a possible racial motivation behind the stabbing. Collins was black.

Witnesses told police the suspect, Urbanski, was intoxicated and incoherent at the time of the attack. Police have said it was random and the victim and suspect did not know each other.

Collins was waiting for an Uber ride with two Maryland students near a bus stop on campus when he was attacked, police said.

When Urbanski approached Collins, who was with two friends, early Saturday morning, the suspect yelled and screamed, saying, step left, step left if you know whats good for you, University Police Chief David Mitchell said.

The victim and his friends looked at the suspect, puzzled, Mitchell said, and Collins told him no.

It was then that the suspect stabbed the victim in his chest, Mitchell said.

Officers were called to the scene around 3 a.m. Saturday, and they found Collins wounded on the sidewalk. Urbanski was arrested there and officers recovered a folding knife, police said.

The unprovoked attack was captured by surveillance cameras, said Sgt. Rosanne Hoaas, spokeswoman for the campus police. Collins died at the hospital.

At the media conference, Mitchell announced that the department has partnered with the Federal Bureau of Investigations Maryland and Delaware Division to investigate Urbanskis online activities, and a possible racial motivation behind the attack.

Urbanski, who is white, is a member of a Facebook group called Alt-Reich, Mitchell said.

When I look at the information thats contained on that website, suffice it to say that its despicable, it shows extreme bias against women, Latinos, members of the Jewish faith and especially African-Americans, Mitchell said of the group.

That brought up a question as to the motive in the stabbing, Mitchell said. The department will work with the FBI to take a closer look at hate as a possible motivation, Mitchell said. Whether that investigation will prove hate as a motivation beyond a reasonable doubt remains to be determined, Mitchell said.

At present, Urbanski has not been charged with a hate crime.

The FBI digital forensics team will scan and try to find information online which sheds light on the case, Mitchell said.

Police can then bring the findings to the States Attorney of Prince Georges County to prosecute the case, Mitchell said.

National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Prince Georges County President Bob Ross said a vigil will be held at Monday evening at Bowie State to honor Collins.",1

"We’re number two in the nation. For what? Hate.

Is this for real?

The Idaho Statesman on Aug. 15 reported on recently released data from the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), a nonprofit that monitors hate groups and advocates for civil rights. Idaho’s SPLC hate ranking (coming in below Montana as the nation’s most hateful state) is based on several factors:

Percent of population identifying as white: 91.5 percent (fifth highest of any state nationwide); percent of population foreign-born: 5.7 percent (22nd lowest); number of hate groups: 12 (7.1 per million residents).

For social scientists, the categories above apparently are significant to the formula to determine a state’s hatefulness.

But for everyday people? We asked them these past couple of weeks, mentioning the data this ranking was based on. The general reaction was astonishment, and – to one category specifically — the words “reverse racism” were said at the fact that a “whiter” state increases likelihood to hate.

They also said, “Where was mention of what hate crime was within Idaho?”

A good question, and in our opinion a better gauge to begin your evaluations. And that data is readily available through Idaho State Police, which showed 28 hate crimes reported last year. That is up by six (27.3 percent) from 2015, and in the five-year trend is third lowest with the high at 36 in 2012. Within that total was seen an increase in hate crime due to religious, racial and sexual orientation, and a decrease due to ethnicity.

And for some perspective, last year the state recorded more than 85,000 offenses; 28 hate crimes isn’t great, but statistically, it’s nearly nonexistent in comparison to the thousands of theft, assault and property destruction crimes reported last year.

So, hate crime isn’t a problem in the state, it’s not significant to rate a mention? We’re not saying that. At issue here is a SPLC report that statistically looks based on non sequitur data, within too short of a time frame, that leads to a conclusion best politically suited to the agenda of the organization that compiled it.

And to make that political hay, Idaho is slandered nationally as Hate State Number 2.

While Idaho County isn’t the state, from this corner of the world we have some extremely generous, caring and kind individuals here who judge on the Martin Luther King, Jr. standard: the contents of a person’s character. Yes, we have prejudice, we have hate; for crying out loud, who doesn’t? But that’s not what defines us as county residents, as communities, nor as a state.",1

"BARNSTABLE, MA — A high-speed chase through Cape Cod and several highways ended Monday morning in Middleborough, after a Dighton man allegedly raced from cops at speeds of up to 100 miles per hour and at times against traffic. Cary Guy, 24, was arrested following a chase that began around 9:30 a.m. when Barnstable Police attempted to stop a 2017 Hyundai Sonata. Guy allegedly led police on a pursuit that spanned Routes 6, 3, 44, 105, 28, and 495. At times, Guy sped up to 100 mph, and on Route 44 in Plymouth and 495 in Middleborough, he was driving against traffic, police say. Barnstable, Sandwich, Plymouth, Carver, Lakeville, and Middleborough Police were involved in the chase, as well as Massachusetts State Police. The Massachusetts State Police Air Wing helped maintain visual contact. You can see video of the pursuit and Guys capture below: The vehicle stopped on the ramp from Route 44 West to Route 495 North after striking cruisers from Lakeville and Middleborough Police.

"A Holocaust memorial in a New Jersey township was defaced by vandals who hoisted a banner over it across which was written an anti-Semitic slur. Photographs posted online Sunday by the state chapter of the Anti-Defamation League show the banner covering the memorial in Lakewood. The message on the banner contains an anti-Semitic ethnic slur, and the slogan ‘will not divide us.’

At its foot is the web address BloodAndSoil.com, which is the site of white nationalist group Vanguard America. In its online manifesto, the group declares its mission to create a nation ”exclusively for the white American peoples.”

State authorities are offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of those responsible. New Jersey Attorney General Christopher Porrino called the vandalism sickening.

The incident comes amid a spike in anti-Semitic hate crimes in the U.S., with assaults, vandalism and other racially motivated crimes against Jews increasing by 86 percent in the first three months of the year, according to the ADL.

Lakewood residents have recently been accused of taking part in an income support scam, Associated Press reported.

Seven married couples in the town, including a rabbi and his wife, face charges of misrepresenting their incomes to falsely claim a combined $2 million in public welfare benefits they were not entitled to. All seven couples have been released on bail following initial court appearances.

The incident comes after anti-Semitic fliers were posted in the town, the New Jersey ADL chapter said. It is not known if the same individuals were responsible for the defacement of the memorial and the leafleting.

"San Diego City Attorney Mara W. Elliott reported on Monday that the man who attacked a gay couple outside the Whole Foods in Hillcrest has pled guilty to assaulting them because of their race and sexual orientation.

The report says the married couple were at the store on University Avenue on September 9, 2017 and said that Teeno Hermoso Amparano physically attacked them while using homophobic and racial slurs.

The result of the attack caused both men to sustain injuries.

The City Attorney’s Office charged Amparano with assault with a deadly weapon, battery, and a hate crime. He pled guilty to the hate crime and battery.

San Diego Gay and Lesbian News talked with Amparano by phone upon his release from jail last week and he maintains that he did not provoke the altercation and adds he is gay himself.

The victims were unavailable for comment.

Amparano was fined $655 and sentenced to three years of probation and ordered to pay restitution to the victims. Amparano is also prohibited from going to Whole Foods and may have no contact with the victims for a duration of three years. He is also not allowed to possess a firearm for ten years and must take an anger management course.

The City Attorney’s office said in a written statement, “Hate crimes are more than just attacks on an individual: they terrorize communities. The City Attorney’s Office has zero tolerance for bigotry and violence, whether perpetrated because of someones race, ethnicity, religion, gender, disability, or sexual orientation, and whenever warranted will charge perpetrators with a hate crime.”

Adds Elliot, “Violent crimes against members of San Diego’s LGBT community tear at the fabric of our city. We strongly encourage victims to come forward so we can prosecute these criminals and see that they are punished.”

Supervising Deputy City Attorney Sam Park prosecuted the case on behalf of the People of California.

Victims and witnesses are encouraged to report hate crimes. For crimes in progress, or where medical assistance is needed, immediately call 9-1-1. In non-emergencies, hate crimes should be reported to the San Diego Police Department at (619) 531-2000 or online via the Citizens Online Police Reporting System. Crime victims can find additional information on the City Attorney’s Victims Services & Resources page.

An Epidemic of Disappearance in America’s Trans Community

It is a sad truth that currently, close to 13,000 people are considered missing or unidentified in the United States (National Missing and Unidentified Persons System). Alongside the horrifying nightly news cases of kidnapped children, missing parents, and teenage runaways are the often-uncirculated stories of missing, abused, and murdered members of our queer and trans communities. Mona Juelisa Whitley is one such recent victim of this heinous trend.

Mona Juelisa Whitley, best known to her friends simply as Mona, was last heard from on February 17, 2017 while making plans to meet with friends in Atlanta. She has not been seen since. A native of New Jersey, Whitley moved to Pittsburgh in 2004 and was employed at Project Silk for a time, through Community Human Services. She moved to Atlanta over a year ago, but was still in contact with her Pittsburgh community up until the day of her disappearance.

It surely comes as no surprise to QueerPGH readers, but trans women of color have been, and continue to be, disproportionately targeted as the victims of hate crimes, transmisogynist violence and ostracism by family, as well as less likely to be publicly reported as missing. If these disappearances are reported at all, they are often covered disrespectfully, blaming and misgendering the victims, as was the case with India Clarke in 2015. The numbers are chilling. According to a 2009 report from the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, 50% of those murdered in anti-LGBTQ hate crimes were trans women while the same study found that 42% of victims were people of color. In just the first six weeks of this year, 7 trans people of color were murdered, the highest rate on record. While we talk about people-as-statistics, we must do everything we can to prevent the members of our community from adding to these numbers.

"The scar travels from Steven Woodson’s sternum to his bellybutton, a visible marker of the day he was stabbed just for being a black man.

Almost two years later, the trauma remains raw, just under the surface.

Sometimes, he’s right back in that moment. Running for his life across a parking lot in West Park. Holding his bleeding belly. His attacker chasing him and yelling: “I’m gonna f------ kill you, n----.”

“No, no, no. I don’t want to die,” Woodson remembers thinking as he ran.

This month, a jury found his attacker, Joel Hunt, 57, guilty of aggravated battery while committing a hate crime. The upgraded hate crime charge doubles Hunt’s potential maximum punishment to 30 years.

Hunt is expected to be sentenced early in 2018.

Hunt is the only person convicted of a hate crime in Broward County this year, according to the State Attorney’s Office. Since 2014, prosecutors have filed 10 hate crime cases. Half are still pending. Three offenders, including Hunt, have been convicted. Charges were dropped in two other cases.

Although the verdict has brought Woodson some closure, he would have been happier had Hunt been handed the attempted murder conviction prosecutors had asked for, he said. But the jury chose the lesser offense.

“He could have killed me and took me away from my mother and father, my two kids, and they would have been without a father,” Woodson said. “I could have been gone, because that was his intention — to kill me.”

The racially motivated stabbing happened March 5, 2016, while Woodson and a friend, both black men, sat outside the West Park apartment building where the friend lived. Hunt, who also lived in the building, came up on a bicycle and sat next to Woodson on a bench.

“I didn’t think anything of it,” Woodson said. “He told me this was his (expletive) bench.”

Woodson distanced himself from the stranger, but Hunt kept engaging the pair, offering them a drink. After they declined, Hunt, who is white, used a racial slur, saying he was tired of seeing blacks everywhere, according to the police report and prosecutors.

Hunt began ranting that he was upset because a black woman had been in his apartment the day before, checking out the building, which was for sale.

“He was upset about the fact that she was black and able to go into his personal space,” said Broward prosecutor Courtney Sowerby-Thomas.

Woodson said he was shocked by the racial rant and just shook his head. His friend asked Hunt why he was a racist.

According to Woodson, Hunt told the pair that he grew up in Detroit, where he had been beaten by a group of black kids whom he had insulted with a racial slur. Woodson kept shaking his head.

“I was just trying to keep myself out of trouble,” Woodson said.

But Hunt suddenly turned on Woodson and again used a racial slur, saying that he and his friend were the type he liked to kill, a police report said. Hunt then called his adult son over and ordered: “Get him, boy. Attack!” Hunt’s son didn’t follow his father’s orders, police said. Instead, Hunt lunged, stabbing Woodson in the stomach, according to the report.

“When he stabbed me, I was looking at his son,” said Woodson.

Doctors did surgery to repair Woodson’s lacerated liver. Recovery was rough, he said. It took him more than a year to walk straight again as he made it a habit to hunch over because of his wounded abdomen. He also now suffers from severe acid reflux, an ailment he didn’t have before the stabbing.

He also harbors emotional trauma beyond the physical toll the stabbing took on his body. Woodson said he became a hermit, generally distrusts people and grapples with anger and even guilt.

“It made me just feel like my life didn’t mean anything for a long time,” Woodson said. “And I had to go to God and pray about it, and keep telling myself, ‘Leave it in God’s hands.’”

Prosecutor David Cannady said hate crimes are “rare to try, rare to file and rare to convict.” The state must successfully prove that the crime was motivated by hate toward race, religion, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation or other personal characteristics such as age or disability.

In Hunt’s case, Sowerby-Thomas said, prosecutors were able to show Hunt had a “history of hatred” that preceded the stabbing. She said Hunt was known to use racial slurs loosely at the apartment complex while speaking with relatives. She cited another incident: He suspected his wife was having an affair, and he became livid mainly because he believed she might have been with a black man.

Hunt was also seen using hand gestures to pretend to shoot at black kids in his predominantly African-American neighborhood in West Park, the prosecutor said. He justified being racist because his parents had been, she said.

“He showed his true colors,” Sowerby-Thomas said.

Hunt denied Woodson’s version of what happened. He’s now asking a judge to overturn the jury verdict and give him a new trial. He claims a deputy’s testimony about other weapons Hunt owned and about Hunt’s past use of racial slurs that neighbors had witnessed could have unfairly swayed the jury, court records show. He also argues that a prosecutor made generic statements about hate crimes in closing arguments to inflame jurors. There is a hearing scheduled Jan. 11.

Woodson says he is still battling to return his life to what it was before the stabbing. He was training to be a fast-food restaurant manager, and now he’s been unable to work, he says. He’s lost about 20 pounds and has had health complications from the stabbing.

“I built this wall and shell around me and stayed away from people. And my friends came around and they tried to get me out and go places with them, and I wouldn’t go,” Woodson said. “But I think now I’m coming out of it a little more.”

According to the most recent hate crimes report compiled by the Florida Attorney General’s Office, there were 124 incidents statewide in 2016, representing a 21 percent increase from the prior year. In Broward County, there were 17 hate crimes in Dania Beach, Davie, Fort Lauderdale, Oakland Park, Pompano Beach, Sunrise, Tamarac, Southwest Ranches and West Park, the 2016 report shows. Two incidents were recorded in Palm Beach County and 30 in Miami-Dade County.

“Thank God the state got some justice for Steven Woodson, because our society will break down if racist people with knives can go around stabbing people,” said Woodson’s attorney, Cullin O’Brien. “That mindset should not exist, and acts of that nature need to be swiftly punished, justly punished.”",1
"NUTLEY, NJ — Nutley police say that a report of a suspicious package that later turned out to be a harmless, homemade battery charger spurred emergency measures at two local schools on Thursday. According to the Nutley Police Department, officers received an FBI alert about a suspicious package in the basement of a building on Franklin Avenue. Nutley police and fire crews, along with Essex County Sheriff officers, then took the necessary precautions to safeguard the community while they investigated the package. Authorities placed two elementary schools in the area on secure in place status while police cordoned off a perimeter. Police shut down Franklin Avenue and the surrounding streets from 11:15 a.m. to 1:15 p.m. A bomb squad and an FBI task force then investigated the package, finding it to be nothing more than a device made by a resident to charge car batteries, Nutley police said. No children or residents were in harms way at any time during the encounter, police stated. Nutley Police Director Alphonse Petracco praised the caller who alerted the FBI and said that he and Police Chief Thomas Strumolo maintained constant communication with the Nutley Board of Education and township officials throughout the incident. The device was unusual and I can see why someone would be concerned, Strumolo said. However, after a brief investigation and interview with the resident who made it, [we determined it] to be no threat at all.",0
"BELLINGHAM, Wash. (AP) — A Washington man accused of threatening his roommates with a knife is facing charges of a hate crime and assault.

The Bellingham Herald reports (http://bit.ly/2rMEQw7 ) 18-year-old Andre Marcel Siftsoff was arrested on charges of first-degree assault, third degree malicious mischief, felony harassment and malicious harassment, which is a hate crime.

Bellingham Police Lt. Danette Beckley says the incident started Sunday when Siftsoff and multiple other people were drinking and started fighting. Siftsoff is accused of going into the kitchen, grabbing a knife and brandishing it toward a roommate while making derogatory statements regarding race and sexual orientation.

The incident was the second hate crime reported to Bellingham Police in the past three weeks.

"BOSTON, MA – A 58-year-old Haverhill man, already on federal probation for one robbery, was arrested and charged today with robbing a branch of Santander Bank in Boston in March. Gregory Carter, 58, was charged in a criminal complaint with one count of bank robbery and is scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court Thursday afternoon. According to court documents, on the morning of March 25, an individual entered a branch of the Santander Bank on Commonwealth Avenue in Boston and handed a teller a note indicating a robbery. The robber stated that he had a gun and repeatedly gestured to his pocket. During the robbery, the robber pulled down a face mask he was wearing and exposed his skin and a thin moustach. The teller handed the robber cash, which was later determined to be $6,129. The robber then exited the bank walking toward Beacon Street. Following the robbery, the teller described the robber to law enforcement officers as a 510 light-skinned black male wearing a dark hat, black ski mask, sunglasses, a black puffy jacket and blue latex gloves. Law enforcement officers reviewed images from exterior surveillance cameras and determined that the robber drove through the area in a black Ford Fusion sedan and parked on Beacon Street. Following the robbery, surveillance images also recorded the robber returning to the sedan and driving away. The description of the robber and the vehicle were disseminated to law enforcement. Three days later, a police officer, who was aware of the recent bank robbery, spotted a black Ford Fusion on Dudley Street in Boston. The driver, who matched the description of the robber, exited the vehicle and began to approach a Bank of America branch. When a Boston Police cruiser stopped in front of the bank, the individual turned around and returned to the vehicle. The officer queried the vehicles registration number and learned that it belonged to Carter. A criminal record check revealed that Carter is currently on probation for a prior bank robbery conviction in federal court. Officers began conducting an investigation and surveillance of Carter, who they allege matched the description of the individual who robbed the Santander Bank on March 25. In the prior case, Carter was sentenced to 151 months in prison followed by 36 months supervised release and $5,400 in restitution for the Aug. 24, 2001 robbery of the Sovereign Bank in Boston.",0

India and Tukey share a bad relationship

There are numerous reasons for it

Some of the reasons are as trivial as they can get

When the founder of the Turkish Republic, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, passed away on the morning of the 10th of November 1938, months before the world broke out into war, a Turkish lady in the streets of Istanbul commented to a reporter covering the tragedy, lamenting “Turkey has lost her lover. Now, she must marry and settle down”. The incident is mentioned in Irfan’s Orga’s ‘Phoenix Ascendant’, a comprehensive biography of Mustafa Kemal Pasha.

National heroes are lionized almost everywhere among native communities; but Ataturk and his younger contemporary Subhash Chandra Bose, enjoy a kind of veneration among their people, that even hardened jingoists elsewhere, would not be caught doing. Subhash was an admirer of Ataturk and was determined to meet him, until the British overlords of India, put a spanner in the works. That was not all. In his ‘Glimpses Of World History’, India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, made glowing references to Mustafa Kemal, calling him a progressive head of state with the singular objective of emancipating the women of his country. Indeed in Turkey, Kemalism is the byword for progressiveness and the radical intellectual approach.

The trajectory of Sultanate ridden Turkey, and post-colonial India have been analogous, but with a few exceptions. Both countries started out with a prominent Socialist outlook, and statesmen who could navigate the complex waters of international one-upmanship to establish their nascent independent territories into positions of respect. Ataturk did this by having the humiliating Treaty of Sevres, scrapped and Nehru hoisted India to the enviable position of the leader of the NAM (Non-Aligned Movement).

Both men encouraged the scientific temper and set their respective countries on the path of western style democracy. India and Turkey are both Constitutionally Laic, Socialist Republics, with elected governments at the helm of affairs. Both states have successfully produced indomitable women heads of state; Indira Gandhi in India, and Tancu Ciller in Turkey.

However, barring the temper of the Constitutions of the two countries, there have been dichotomies which cannot be missed. The Indian state has an army that has never displayed an interest in the legislative functioning of its polity, maintaining a respectful distance from political upheavals. On the other hand, the Turkish military has tried to usurp power multiple times, in that country. The first three times it attempted to do so, it successfully affected a regime change. The years were 1960, 1971, and 1980. A fourth rumbling from the uniformed men was heard in 2016, but was immediately suppressed and extinguished by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Some insiders and whistle blowers have claimed, that the coup was an eyewash, that was perpetrated by Erdogan’s moles present within the military. After all, the only person who benefitted from the crackdowns, was Erdogan himself.

India’s north-western neighbour, has been a major roadblock on the path to India-Turkey relations. Right from its inception, Pakistan has been a firm ally of Turkey. The roots of this friendship go deep down and can be found embedded in the Khilafat movement of the sub-continent during British times, when Indian Muslims had banded together to oppose the abdication of the last Turkish Sultan, and with him, the position of the Caliph of Islam. Turkey supports Pakistan’s stance on Kashmir, something that has always troubled the Indian upper echelons, which wants to steer the relationship between their nation and Turkey, ahead.

Where Kemalism had impressed itself upon the elite masses of Turkey, with its accent on westernization, President Erdogan has managed to ride the votebank of the working class, with his emphasis on political Islam. He, unlike his other civilian predecessors, has not only managed to hold on to his position, but has also been successful in reinforcing it and becoming the master of all he surveys.

Turkey remained unaffected by the Arab Spring revolts that have shaken the Middle East since the April of 2011, with the latest victims being Yemen and Iran, which is a testament to its stability. But, as India has watched from the sidelines, this crucial NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) member, has shown its back to democracy by embracing a new shade of totalitarianism in the form of the Turkish President’s office, stifled the opposition, dissolved protests from dissidents, and has sought to deal with the Kurdish problem in a much harsher way than previous governments.

Turkey being Asia’s gateway to Europe, a member of the OIC (Organization of Islamic Cooperation), and a developed nation by many estimates, is crucial to India as not only an economic partner, but also a comrade among the fraternity of the Islamic states, with whom maintaining good relations is vital to India’s interests. During the Cold War, Indo-Turkish bonding had been left in suspended animation due to a conflict of interests; as India was a founding member of the NAM (Non-Aligned Movement), while Turkey was firmly in the Allied Camp, in the Western created and controlled NATO setup.

In the 21st century, India and Turkey have produced two unexpectedly hawkish point men, who seem to share a warm personal rapport with each-other. While India’s Prime Minister Modi, started out in life as a tea seller, Turkey’s Erdogan used to sell lemonade at a train station. Born and raised in humble circumstances, the two men have shown some resolve in bettering their bilateral ties. The year that Modi was indicted for his indifference to the carnage of Gujarat’s Muslims – 2002 – was also the same year that Recep Tayyip Erdogan made himself visible on the radar of Turkish politics.

Despite the co-incidental sweet spot though, India and Turkey are unable to capitalize on the opportunities afforded to each-other. Among the thorny issues that need to be tackled, are:

Trade Kashmir FethullahGulen Terrorism

1.Trade between India and Turkey, is to the tune of 6.4 billion, but India accounts for a much smaller percentage of Turkish imports than other countries, especially those from within the European Union, from whom Turkey buys goods. There is an enormous potential in investing in infrastructure via construction, as Turkey can provide its assistance to India over the matter.

2. On the Kashmir front, Turkey currently favours Pakistan’s stand, though not openly discouraging India. As an ombudsman in the OIC (Organization of Islamic Cooperation), it is imperative for India, to get Turkey on board over Kashmir and make that country sympathetic to our stand on the issue.

3. FethullahGulen is a spiritual Sufi Turkish leader, who presently lives in exile in the United States. He used to be a formidable political figure in the power corridors of Ankara, and was a close aide of President Erdogan. A one-time imam in Turkey, Mr. Gulen was an associate of Erdogan and his AKP (Justice and Development Party) and continues to preside over an empire of charitable institutions that provide education and low-cost housing to the needy, globally. Many Gulenist institutions function in India and have never caused a friction with the Indian state. However, during President Erdogan’s last Indian visit, which took place on the 1st of May 2017, he had insisted that India close down all Gulenist outlets, as they were instruments of sedition against his government. India refused to do so and looked upon the directive as amounting to interfering with our sovereignty, since any such decision could only be taken by our own authorities. Fethullah Gulen was accused of masterminding the military coup that took place in Turkey in the July of 2016, albeit without sufficient evidence. The coup itself, and the crackdown on it, was the bloodiest in the history of Turkey, but for the very first time, it was successfully contained by the elected government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Spiritually and philosophically, Mr. Gulen’s views are more feminist and reconciliatory than the pro-hardline views held by Erdogan.

4. During the day long meeting between President Erdogan and Prime Minister Modi, the former pledged full support to India in its fight against terrorism, but cherry picked on the issue. Erdogan’s primary concern was to help India in our war against the Naxalites, which is a Left-Wing secessionist movement in this country. As an Islamist Right Winger, the Turkish President’s anti-Naxalite stand was predictable. However, he evinced no particular interest in the incidents of cross-border terrorism that India has had to suffer. Pakistan and Turkey are close international allies, especially since Pakistan is the world’s only nation that supports the Turkish created entity of the TRNC (Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus). Turkey has suffered numerous terrorist attacks ever since the inception of the Turkish Republic in 1923, that were carried out by the PKK, an outlawed, armed Kurdish, political resistance group.

The reason why Turkey is important to India, is due to the reality, that Turkey is West Asia’s most important state, geographically, politically, and militarily. Situated at the crossroads of Asia and Europe, this much-misunderstood country, has been knocking on the doors of the EU (European Union) and if it resolves its Human Rights record pertaining to the Kurds, and the Ottoman Genocide, it might very well become the only Asian nation to be an EU member state. As a leading member of the OIC (Organization of Islamic Cooperation), Turkey’s support to India is vital for the latter to gain traction within the community of the Muslim world, since currently only some Gulf nations are friendly with us. Turkey is a NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) member, and its military prowess within that body is substantial. It is the only progressive, and secular (though these are increasingly being eroded), developed nation in West Asia, with a stable political climate. India, being the country with the second largest Muslim population, it is imperative, that the two nations develop closer ties and lasting bonds, if they can lessen the distance between themselves.

The land of the Whirling Dervishes, where the compassionate views of Mevlana Jalaluddin Rumi have cast a lasting shadow, is India’s forbidden fruit. It can only be hoped, that political wisdom, farsightedness, and reciprocity, will allow the Indians to lay the foundations of a unique friendship, with the West Asian colossus of Turkey.

"The United Nations reports that the world’s population is now about 7.6 billion, and it is growing constantly.

"The attack on Muslim worshippers outside a London mosque on Monday follows a rising wave of violence and harassment directed against Muslims across Britain and around the world.

This month alone, a Muslim woman wearing a head scarf told police in Lancashire her car was struck by a bag of vomit. Worshippers at the Omar Faruque mosque in Cambridge found strips of ham attached to their vehicles. Several Muslim families have reported receiving letters warning, You are no longer welcome in this country. Scores say they have been spat on.

Across Britain, Muslims say they are being targeted by a wave of animosity and violence simply because of the way they dress and worship, and because they share a religion hijacked by bloodthirsty extremists like the Islamic State group, which was quick to claim responsibility for recent attacks in Britain and elsewhere. In Mondays attack, a man plowed a van into a crowd of worshippers, injuring at least nine people — a tactic used in the recent attacks on Westminster and London bridges.

Londons Police Commissioner, Cressida Dick, said Mondays assault outside two mosques during the holy month of Ramadan was clearly an attack on Muslims.

We are easy targets because of the way we dress and when we pray, said Hassan Ali, a 34-year-old resident of Finsbury Park, a north London neighborhood that is home to a large Muslim population and where the attack occurred. But every time there is an attack here or elsewhere, we are blamed. When we are attacked, people look away.

Since the wave of IS-inspired terror attacks in Britain, there has been a five-fold increase of hate crimes against Muslims. Tensions have also been running high since Britains decision to leave the European Union, a vote that was largely driven by anti-immigrant rhetoric — a message that was further reinforced by some of Britains right-leaning tabloids and spread by populist European politicians promising to stem immigration and tackle terrorism associated with IS.

I feel unsafe, said Emma Salem, a 15-year-old Muslim who lives in the neighborhood targeted on Monday.

Such attacks against Muslims have been on a worldwide increase. In January, a white nationalist opened fire on an Islamic cultural center in Quebec City, Canada, killing six people and wounding nearly 20. In the same month, the Islamic Center of Lake Travis in Austin, Texas, was destroyed by a fire in what authorities called a hate crime and another mosque was burned to the ground. Last year, nearly 100 mosques were attacked in Germany and dozens across Europe have been targeted by arsonists this year.

Stirring tension plays an important part in Islamic State and al-Qaida propaganda, as well as propaganda by right-leaning political groups.

Brendan Cox, the widower of the slain British parliamentarian Jo Cox, said both the far right and Islamic extremists are propelled by polarization.

Far-right fascists and Islamic terrorists are driven by the same hatred of difference, same ideology of supremacy & use of same tactics, he wrote on Twitter.

The Islamic State group and al-Qaida have targeted Muslims living in the West, repeatedly saying they will never be fully accepted members in a society of unbelievers.

The idea has been to sow mistrust and drive both sides to the extremes. In the case of IS, the propaganda has gone even further, warning Muslims that if they failed to either join the fight in defense of the extremists self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria or carry out attacks in their home countries, they themselves were complicit in a system of oppression against Muslims.

Islamic State supporters used Mondays attack to fuel more tensions by noting that the attacker, identified as 47-year-old Darren Osborne, was not shot to death, unlike the London Bridge attackers. Muslims. you need to wake up, the war is starting now in your own streets, the message went on, according to the SITE Intelligence Group.

Muslims are repeatedly being used as a political football and pieces in a propaganda campaign, said Mohammed Shafiq, head of the Ramadhan Foundation. The rampant rise in Islamophobia has been perpetuated by right-wing newspapers and outlets. This has led to an atmosphere where it is acceptable to harass and ostracize Muslims. The Muslim community is constantly demonized.

Residents of Finsbury Park said they were angry that the police seemed slow to call Mondays incident a terror attack. They also expressed frustration that attacks on the Muslim community have received little coverage or sympathy.

There has been an outpouring of sympathy for all the recent terror attacks but hardly a whisper on this attack, said 23-year-old Ali Habib, who described how the white van swerve into a crowd of worshippers gathered outside a mosque following evening prayers. People are both scared and angry. Parents are scared to send their children to evening prayers.

The Muslim Council of Britain has called for extra security around mosques, describing the Finsbury Park van attack as the most violent manifestation of Islamophobia.

Mosques across Britain and elsewhere are expecting large crowds this week as Ramadan draws to a close.

"CLAREMONT, Calif. (AP) — The president of a California college is condemning hate speech after some Latino students sent a spray-painted message to white students wearing hoop earrings, accusing them of appropriating their cultural style.

A wall on the side of a dormitory at Pitzer College in Southern California devoted to unmoderated free speech through art was recently painted by a group of Latino students who wrote the message, “White Girl, Take OFF Your Hoops.”

College president Melvin L. Oliver responded to the message in an email to students, saying speech that “resorts to hate, violence and threats” won’t be tolerated.

Oliver says productive discourse and opposing views that “broaden our perspectives as global citizens” are encouraged.

Student Alegria Martinez says she and other women of color created the art because they’re tired of white women appropriating their style, including wearing hoop earrings.

"STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- A Tompkinsville woman has been charged with a hate crime for targeting a visually-impaired man in her community three weeks ago, stealthily entering his apartment while he was inside with his seeing-eye dog and swiping personal items, prosecutors allege.

Natalya Fedyk, 35, of the 100 block of Victory Boulevard, pleaded not guilty at her arraignment Wednesday in state Supreme Court, St. George, to two counts of burglary as a hate crime, along with multiple counts of burglary, grand larceny and stolen-property possession.

The incident occurred at about 10:15 a.m. on April 14 in an Avon Place apartment, according to a criminal complaint.

Assistant District Attorney Adam Silberlight said Fedyk went to the apartment of a person who is almost totally blind to take advantage of him.

Silberlight said videotape surveillance shows the defendant peering into the apartment and watching the movements of the victim and the dog. She waited for the dog to walk to the other end of the apartment and then entered, he said.

Fedyk swiped the victims wallet, three credit or debit cards, a watch, a service-dog registration, cash and other items, the complaint said.

She was arrested at about 8:20 p.m. that evening on the corner of Willis and Fiedler avenues in Tompkinsville, said police.

The hate crime charges accuse Fedyk of intentionally selecting the victim in whole or in substantial part because of a belief or perception of the disability of the person.

Under the Hate Crimes Act of 2000, someone can be charged with a hate crime if they commit specified offenses due to the victims religion, race, color, gender, national origin, ancestry, sexual orientation or disability.

Defense lawyer Susan Platis told the court she believes the hate-crime allegations against Fedyk are leaps in logic and just guesses on the D.A.s part.

Platis said the defendant has no prior criminal record.

Fedyk, a thin woman garbed in a gray outer vest, a red short-sleeve shirt and blue jeans, did not address the court.

The defense initially rejected prosecutors offer to plead guilty to a class C felony, in exchange for a sentence of 42 months in prison, plus a period of post-release supervision.

The top charge against Fedyk, second-degree burglary as a hate crime, is a class B felony which carries a minimum sentence of five years up to a maximum sentence of 25 years on a trial conviction.

Besides the alleged April 14 incident, the defendant is also accused of victimizing another person the prior day.

Fedyk used a ruse to enter the Tompkinsville apartment of a former friend and snatched a watch and two hats, according to the complaint and Silberlight.

Shes charged with misdemeanor counts of petit larceny and stolen-property possession.

Fedyk has other problems with the law.

Silberlight said she was arrested on a shoplifting charge in Manhattan on Monday. She was issued a desk appearance ticket, he said.",1
"By  Scott Bernarde A Paulding County father was indicted Monday for murder in the October death of his 12-year-old son. WSB-TV reported Shayaa Forbes was indicted by a grand jury on several charges, including three counts of murder in the death of Eric Forbes, 12, on Oct. 11, 2013. The elder Forbes is facing a life sentence without parole. The indictment accuses the father of long-term abuse of Eric, including repeatedly biting the boy. Results of a GBI autopsy in October pointed to the suspected abuse, and the boys death was ruled a homicide. On Oct. 11, Paulding sheriffs deputies responded to a reported drowning at 181 North Springs Drive near Acworth and found Eric unconscious. The father said the boy had drowned. Eric was pronounced dead at Paulding Wellstar Hospital. Deputies determined the boy had been abused. Shayaa Forbes was immediately arrested and charged with child cruelty. A murder charge was added less than a week later after preliminary results of the autopsy. In the indictment, prosecutors said the father also beat his son with a belt, wooden paddle and his fists, according to the TV stations report. Forbes has been free on bail since earlier this month. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said Forbes was released on April 17 after posting a $25,000 bond, lowered from $30,000. He had been in the county jail without an indictment since his October arrest. Forbes has been living with his girlfriend in Kennesaw since his release, the newspaper reported.

"In a previous article we reported on journalist Alexandra Bruell’s exceedingly sloppy work in her Wall Street Journal article on Scientology. Essentially, Bruell uncritically repeated Scientology’s undocumented claims of persecution arising from Leah Remini’s Emmy-winning show Scientology and the Aftermath. As we noted in our previous article:

“Leah Remini’s hate campaign of religious bigotry in its first season alone generated more than 400 incidents of harassment, threats of violence and vandalism against our churches and members,” reads one letter from STAND, dated from August and addressed to Geico’s assistant vice president of marketing Bill Brower. “The threat level has again risen, precisely coincident with A&E’s promotion and airing of the second season of this show, now spawning even more threats—bombings, murder and acts of physical violence.”

Alexandra Bruell apparently couldn’t be bothered to ask for even one shred of hard evidence from Scientology in the form of police reports, threatening e-mails, or any other substantiating proof. Instead, Bruell simply repeated Scientology’s claim. This sort of lazy journalism is highly offensive to the victims of Scientology and serves only to tarnish the reputation of the Wall Street Journal. I actually wondered how this unvetted story got by WSJ editors.

What are the real facts about violence against Scientology?

For a more in-depth analysis of Scientology’s suspect claims, we turn to Dr. Jeff Wasel.

Dr. Wasel holds Masters and Ph.D degrees from the London School of Economics (LSE), and is an expert in financial crime and related criminal behaviors, risk, and compliance. As a researcher with the LSE’s Information Systems Innovation Group, he was one of the earliest, post-9/11 investigators to examine the use of behavioral profiling, data mining and data analytics, in uncovering, understanding, and disrupting the use of money laundering, hawala, and other terrorism-related financial networks, as well as those of trans-national criminal organizations (TCOs). Additionally, Dr. Wasel and his LSE colleagues contributed to an EU-sponsored, multi-year, multi-disciplinary, profiling, data privacy and data protection research initiative, the Future of Identity in the Information Society, (FIDIS). Outcomes from the FIDIS initiative, made a significant contribution to the enactment of the robust, EU-wide data protection statutes now in place, and recently used so effectively by Hungarian authorities against Scientology in Hungary.

Using a variety of perspectives, methods, and tools, Dr. Wasel has been investigating the financial irregularities of the Church of Scientology for over ten years. While Scientology has been the subject of studies by several noted New Religious Movement (NRMs) scholars, Dr. Wasel’s ongoing work differs significantly in this regard; rather than researching Scientology from a theologian’s historical, and/or subjective, philosophical perspective, his research emphasizes a quantitative, forensically-grounded, multi-disciplinary approach, drawn from the fields of accounting, psychology, criminology, statistics, and data science, among other fields.

With this unique approach, Dr. Wasel has identified patterns of behavior that may indicate violations such as inurement, entanglement of funds, corporate governance irregularities, and tax avoidance/under-reporting; financial crimes such as fraud, structuring, and money laundering; and immigration crimes such as visa fraud, and human trafficking among other, ongoing egregious activities; such patterns are in addition to the Church of Scientology’s already extensive list of widely-documented and verified cases of criminal and anti-social behavior. I asked Dr. Wasel for his analysis of Scientology’s claims of having been the target of “increased violence” due to Leah Remini’s show. His analysis is as follows:

It is clear from her recent article, that WSJ reporter Alexandra Bruell failed to properly source or validate any of Scientology’s claims of “violence”, wherein Scientology asserted increased threat levels against both it’s members and property, as a means to legitimize its call for a boycott against those companies sponsoring Leah Remini’s “Aftermath” show on the A&E network. In addition to these perceived threats of physical violence, Scientology has also called for a boycott in response to alleged “religious bigotry”, above and beyond the alleged “hate crimes and violence” against its members. However, as the following analysis will demonstrate, there is no substance to the Church of Scientology’s allegations; moreover, given the seriousness of these allegations, both the Church of Scientology and Ms. Bruell, have failed to produce any independently substantiated evidence for the Church’s sensationalistic claims.

A basic Google search uncovers easily verifiable evidence that Scientology’s claims have no basis in fact. As an example, a recent report (2016/2017) conducted by the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism, a research institution located within California State San Bernardino, and entitled “Final U.S. Status Report: Hate Crime Analysis & Forecast For 2016/2017,” provides a wealth of data refuting the Church’s spurious claims, all in a concise, well-articulated, and visually compelling format; an earnest skimming of the charts and graphs alone, would have invalidated the church’s position, let alone a thorough reading of this detailed investigation. The detail in the report is reflected in both the breadth and depth of it’s data sources: for instance, the authors note that it is a “compilation of official, vetted police data from over 40 U.S. cities, counties and states.” Subsequently, given the depth of analysis therein, as well as my own efforts in analyzing this report, it’s not surprising that I can find no evidence of any hate crime or hate-related violence, directed specifically towards the Church of Scientology or any of its members or properties. Indeed, no mention of Scientology appears anywhere in the report. (A PDF of this report appears at the bottom of this article). If such violence against Scientologists occurred as alleged, it was never reported in a way that would reflect among the widely available criminal justice and policy-related statistical data sources included in this report.

Tellingly, law enforcement agencies for both Los Angeles, which has the highest concentration of Scientologists anywhere in the world, and Clearwater, Florida, home to the second largest concentration of Scientologists world-wide, (as well as both cities having provided significant data sources for this report), reported no acts of criminal violence against Scientologists or their property. Perhaps more revealing, is the fact that the Church hasn’t produced any rebuttal, nor supporting data, for either the media or the public to review, in substantiating not only their most recent claims, but historical evidence of any concerted “pattern of violence” against church property or it’s individual members.

This lack of data stands in stark contrast to the expensive study the Church of Scientology funded to show its positive financial impact on the City of Clearwater. In that study, released in 2014 and conducted by the Center for Economic Forecasting and Analysis at Florida State University, the Church spared no effort in offering a wealth of detailed information on its beneficial financial contribution to Clearwater.

However, what the report doesn’t say reveals more about the church’s motivations: the “contribution” the church touts, is the result of hotel taxes and property taxes it pays as a result of it’s significant real estate holdings in the Clearwater area; no where does the report mention any ecclesiastical, social, or cultural benefits resulting from Scientology’s presence. That’s not surprising, given Scientology contractually shields itself in this regard, by stating that by practicing it’s “religion”, it promises no spiritual outcomes whatsoever, nor does it’s “dissemination,” Scientology’s version of proselytizing, involve anything less than a hard sell cash grab.

This begs the question: Why then, has the Church of Scientology not funded an equally extensive study, supporting its claims of increased violence against it’s members and property, as a result of Ms. Remini’s show? The answer is simple: The evidence for Scientology’s claims is statistically nonexistent; moreover, any efforts towards inferring even the slightest connection between the two, however tangentially, have been half-hearted or uncoordinated at best. Aside from an isolated incident of a young man, the son of former Sea Org members, throwing a hammer through the window of a Scientology church — a crime for which he was arrested and convicted for — Scientology has produced no hard evidence to sustain its claim that Ms. Remini’s show resulted in “more than 400 incidents of harassment, threats of violence and vandalism against our churches and members.”

Not only does Scientology fail to produce any evidence, of what would be a statistically significant representation, (it’s alleged “400 incidents”), it also fails to prove any causal relationship between Ms. Remini’s show and any claimed acts of violence, let alone a statistically significant, Federally-monitored “hate crime”. Rather, Scientology typically relies upon worn-out, demographically or culturally suspect tropes, red herrings, or vague, academically tenuous or discredited “studies”; for instance, in regards to causal factors of “violence”, they reference the statistically tenuous links between violent, first person shooter video games, and varying indicators of supposed increased levels of violence among particular “categories” of “young” people. It’s clear that analyzing, or more so, the accurate parsing of data, is incompatible with the generalities and situational veracity that comprise any Scientology narrative or behavioral rationalization; though when all else fails, the default defense or “reasoned response” is one of misdirection, ad hominem, slander, or gross generalization.

While the report shows that there has been a significant rise in hate-related crimes across the country, such crimes are predominantly racially-based. Religious-specific hate crimes comprise 19.7% of the aggregate, with anti-Muslim and anti-Jewish crimes predominating. As I indicated, Scientology is not mentioned anywhere in the span of this report, nor in any reliable reporting for 2017 that I was able to source otherwise. More revealing, is that the vast majority of crimes are against people, not places, further exposing Scientology’s lie as to violence directed against Scientology-owned properties. One can further extrapolate from this distinction, that in addition to the dearth of property crime, any concerted efforts directed at individual members is also exaggerated, given Scientology’s hysterical pronouncements regarding any perceived slight, let alone physical assault.

In assessing the context of the report, I would offer a few considerations to the reader. Although America’s post-election social domain has certainly been turbulent, the author(s) appear to have omitted a competent contextual discussion, in situating a comparison between the current state of anti-Muslim bias/violence, as it relates to, for instance, the last 10 years, or the role of media bias. Furthermore, they fail to include any baseline longitudinal (time) stipulations or controls in this regard, given that anti-Muslim behavior has risen steadily since 9/11, potentially skewing the mean; it could well be considered a constant in this regard.

Additionally, political/terror actions by jihadists, or conversely, by Jews, both here or in the Middle East, can induce random situational spikes, and I see no mention of having longitudinally rationalized these spikes in the data. The contextual significance evolves from factors such as the editorial coverage of ISIS’ and other terror group activity in 2016, along with repressive Israeli military activity, and increased pro-Palestinian activism, specifically the Boycott, Divest, Sanction (BDS) movement across the academic and SJW world. That said, in all fairness, responsibility for my concerns rests on both those compiling the data sourced by the authors, as well as the authors themselves.

Lastly, the use of unqualified data from the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) is problematic in my view; in recent years, much of SPLC’s analysis and research has become verifiably politicized, and no longer enjoys it’s previous reputation for objectivity and methodological rigor. Having used earlier examples of Mr. Dees and Co.’s data on extremism in America, it pains me to make such an observation. Aside from subjectivity of it’s advocacy efforts, it’s worrying that the SPLC is not unique these days, in having the objectivity of its research and policy data subverted through a variety of questionable means. It’s an unfortunate reflection of contemporary norms within the “wonk world,” in that the sourcing and delivering of objective research, has become more incumbent on sponsor dollars, rather than scholarship, intellectual rigor, and personal integrity.

In closing, I would encourage readers to study the report; stylistically, it’s well-written and refreshingly free of multi-syllabic academic drudgery, and significantly, is disturbingly informative. To that, this report certainly refutes the Church of Scientology’s victimization narrative, and all of it’s hypocritical, hyperbolic venting regarding “bigotry and hate”, while simply reiterating that STAND, (STTAD? STOOD? Whatever the hell), has no leg to “STAND” on… Surprise, surprise.",1

"Lambda Legal Calls out Sessions Hypocrisy as He Touts DOJ Assistance in Iowa Hate Crimes Case

For Sessions to seek credit for helping prosecute hate crimes against transgender people is akin to him handing out gasoline and matches and then looking for a pat on the back when he prosecutes someone for committing arson.

NEW YORK (October 15, 2017) The New York Times today reported that the Department of Justice has assigned a federal prosecutor to assist in the hate crime prosecution of Kedarie/Kandicee Johnsons murderer. The African-American Iowa teen identified as both transgender and gender-fluid. Lambda Legal Director of Strategy Sharon McGowan issued the following statement in response:

Of course it is important and right that the Department of Justice assist in bringing to justice the murderer of Kedarie/Kandicee Johnson, one of the far too many transgender people, and especially transgender people of color, targeted in the ongoing lethal epidemic of hate violence. But it is the height of cynicism for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to use this - frankly rare - instance of civil rights enforcement under his tenure to deflect from the current departments sustained opposition to its historic mission.

No one in the Trump administration has done more to harm LGBT people, and especially transgender people, than Jeff Sessions  and in a government chock full of anti-LGBT appointees, that is saying a lot. From revoking the guidance that assured trans kids they were welcome in school to asserting that transgender workers do not deserve protection against employment discrimination to defending Trumps unconstitutional ban of transgender troops, Sessions has again and again defined transgender Americans as second-class citizens and has created an environment that encourages and enables violence against trans people.

He has similarly undermined the civil rights and safety of people of color, through such actions as his order to review all consent decrees designed to address systemic police violence.

For Sessions now to seek credit for helping prosecute hate crimes against transgender people is akin to him handing out gasoline and matches and then looking for a pat on the back when he prosecutes someone for committing arson.

We hope that the Senators questioning Sessions at Wednesdays oversight hearing of the Judiciary Committee are not distracted by this publicity stunt designed for their benefit and instead hold him accountable for the Department of Justices appalling failure to do its job under his direction.

HRC Statement on Jeff Sessions Credit-Seeking One Week After Launching a License to Discriminate and Removing Title VII Protections for Transgender People

WASHINGTON, DC  Today, the Human Rights Campaign ( HRC ) issued a statement in response to reports that Attorney General Jeff Sessions is taking credit for directing a Department of Justice lawyer to help prosecute a hate crime case in Iowa.

Sarah Warbelow, HRC Legal Director said:

One week after Jeff Sessions changed DOJ policy by refusing to protect transgender people under Title VII and launched a sweeping license to discriminate against LGBTQ people, hes seeking credit for prosecuting a hate crime? We believe Americans deserve an Attorney General willing to address systemic discrimination and enforce policies and laws that prevent hate violence in the first place.

One week ago, at the direction of Jeff Sessions, the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) rescinded a memo issued by the Obama Administration and replaced it with a discriminatory memo arguing that anti-discrimination protections under Title VII do not apply to transgender people. DOJ instructed all U.S. attorneys to adopt this dangerous position in all pending and future matters. The very next day, Sessions launched a sweeping license to discriminate that puts millions of LGBTQ Americans at risk of discrimination.

A preliminary analysis of the Trump-Pence administrations license to discriminate indicates that LGBTQ people and women will be at risk in some of the following ways:

A Social Security Administration employee could refuse to accept or process spousal or survivor benefits paperwork for a surviving same-sex spouse.

A federal contractor could refuse to provide services to LGBTQ people, including in emergencies, without risk of losing federal contracts.

Organizations that had previously been prohibited from requiring all of their employees from following the tenets of the organizations faith could now possibly discriminate against LGBTQ people in the provision of benefits and overall employment status.

Agencies receiving federal funding, and even their individual staff members, could refuse to provide services to LGBTQ children in crisis, or to place adoptive or foster children with a same-sex couple or transgender couple simply because of who they are.",1
"As Tennessee authorities continue the urgent search for the gunman who killed four people at a Waffle House, families mourn the victims who have been identified as a student, musician and a Waffle House employee.

Travis Reinking sat in his pickup truck outside of a Nashville Waffle House and cased it before taking his AR-15 rifle and gunning down Taurean Sanderlin, a Waffle House employee of five years, and 20-year-old Joe Perez outside the restaurant, authorities said.

—Meet hero who disarmed Waffle House shooter “I could have never seen my daughter again”—

The NY Daily News reports that Reinking then went inside and fired off and killed 21-year-old DeEbony Groves and 23-year-old Akilah Dasilva, who later died at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

In the melee, James Shaw Jr. is being hailed as a hero for wrestling the gun away from Reinking and ending the killing spree.

Family and friends are still grappling with the news of the tragic loss.

Shaundelle Brooks Dasilva’s mother said his name means: “the intelligent one.”

“He was talented, loved music,” Gifted Queen, a local artist and friend, told News Channel 5. “I can’t believe it.”

Dasilva was reportedly at the Waffle House with his girlfriend, 21-year-old Shanita Waggoner, who was also wounded and hospitalized, according to reports. He was said to be with his brother too.

DeEbony Groves was a student at Belmont University and an avid basketball player. She was studying social work.

“She was a brilliant young lady, very intelligent and a very hard worker,” said Gallatin High School coach Kim Kendrick, according to the Tennessean. “She was a very likable young lady. She was one of three seniors on her team, and she was a great role model for the other players because of her hard work and dedication to her studies and to her school.”

Belmont University released a statement saying:

“The entire campus community is shocked and devastated by how such senseless violence has taken the life of this young woman, an individual full of immense potential,” the university said in a statement released through its communications department.

“We extend our thoughts and prayers to her family and friends as they come to terms with unimaginable grief. Belmont will be offering counseling and other support services to members of our campus in the coming hours and days.”

Groves was also a member of the Tau Nu Delta Sigma Theta sorority. Another woman, 24-year-old Sharita Henderson was her sorority sister from another school and was wounded in the Waffle House shooting as well.

The Nashville Mayor David Briley has called for action to remove these dangerous guns from off the street.

“We need comprehensive gun reform to address mass shootings, domestic shootings, accidental shootings and homicides,” Briley said at news conference.

“If we can all just come together for the greater good, we can take these weapons of war off the streets of our country,” Briley said.

Reinking is still on the run.

Some are wondering if the shooting should be classified as a hate crime.",1

District Attorney Matthew Van Houten said he had consulted with the victim, Solomon Shewit ’19, a black Cornell junior, when deciding to drop the three misdemeanor charges — including the one hate crime charge — against Greenwood. Van Houten said Shewit wanted to focus on his time at Cornell and avoid the “continued stress of this litigation.”

“Based upon extensive discussions with the victim and with the approval of his parents, we agreed to resolve the case in this manner instead of proceeding to trial,” Van Houten said.

The prosecutor said the legal side of the charges is “extremely complex” and that details of the altercation had placed the strength of the criminal case into question.

“The fact that the victim, who is a person of color, pursued the defendant onto the defendant’s property, with the intention of confronting Greenwood about his offensive language, creates a level of doubt whether the victim was selected based upon his race,” Van Houten said. “Additionally, alcohol was a significant factor in this altercation.”

Van Houten said “there is no excuse for such deplorable behavior” at Cornell or anywhere else and acknowledged that members of the community may want to see a harsher sentence for Greenwood.

But Van Houten said people should not allow their emotions “to outweigh an objective analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the evidence” and that “we cannot substitute our own feelings for those of the victim, who fully supports this resolution.”

Sitting in the lobby of a hotel in downtown Ithaca on Tuesday morning, Greenwood’s lawyer, Ronald P. Fischetti, told The Sun that the sophomore “never struck” the victim and that he “never should’ve been charged.”

“It’s very simple,” Fischetti said. “He just didn’t do it.”",1
"ROUND ROCK, TX — A Round Rock man described by a local newspaper as having shared red carpets with celebrities and driven Bentleys is now on trial on charges of orchestrating several jewelry store robberies. Marvis Lewis, 40, is in U.S. District Court where he stands accused by local and federal investigators of recruiting an accomplice to steal diamonds, rings and watches from several stores in Austin and Houston during the years 2014 and 2015, the Austin American-Statesman reported. Lewis is further charged with orchestrating another jewelry store heist in Ohio, netting $548,000 in ill-gotten gains. Lewis was arrested in February 2016 and subsequently charged with 16 felony counts, including conspiracy to interfere with commerce by threats of violence, money laundering and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, the newspaper reported. He faces a minimum sentence of 82 years in prison if found guilty on all charges, according to the report. The trial in U.S. Judge Lee Yeakels courtroom is expected to take up to two weeks. Lewis is reportedly representing himself in the case, telling the jury he is innocent was already wealthy thus eliminating the incentive of thievery, according to the report. His Instagram account dubbed 02beauxta attests to his opulence and extravagant lifestyle, with photos of him at Oscar and Emmy award show parties, and taking selfies with the likes of Madonna, Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, Eddie Murphy and Derek Jeter. The Statesman noted that Lewis insistence on representing himself has complicated the already complex case involving some 14 robberies, particularly given his penchant for objecting to the prosecutors questions. And in his court asides, Lewis isnt exonerating himself well as the Statesman described one particularly testy exchange with the judge. Its pretty obvious you need a lawyer, Yeakel told the defendant, to which Lewis responded Its pretty obvious youre a crooked judge. >>> Read the full story at Austin American-Statesman Image via Shutterstock",0
"KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) — The suspect in the fatal shooting of an Indian immigrant last year in a Kansas City suburb may plead guilty to a federal hate crime charge.

The Kansas City Star reports 52-year-old Adam Purinton, of Olathe, on Wednesday filed a change of plea notice in federal court in Kansas, where he is charged with a hate crime in the February 2017 shooting death of Srinivas Kuchibhotla.

Purinton already pleaded guilty to a state charge of first-degree murder in Kuchibhotlas death and to two counts of attempted first-degree murder for wounding to other men at Austins Bar in Olathe.

Federal prosecutors allege that Purinton targeted two victims because of their race, ethnicity or country of origin. A hate crime conviction carries a potential death sentence.

Wednesdays notice indicates Purinton intends to change his plea May 21.

"Various threats made online against minority students at a Pennsylvania high school are not hate crimes, West Goshen Township, Pennsylvania law enforcement has determined, as the suspect turned out to be a black student.

The 14-year-old student from West Chester East High School was charged yesterday with harassment, cyber bullying, and terroristic threats for posts he made on the “East Shade Room” Instagram page.

According to Philly.com, the threats included “Dirty Mexicans,” “If you guys come to school tomorrow, you will die,” and “I feel bad for y’all. Because y’all think it’s a joke. Each and everyone on [sic] those n—s will be killed tomorrow.”

Superintendent Jim Scanlon said police nabbed the suspect via subpoenas of Verizon and Instagram.

Despite the non-hate crime aspect of the matter, some (minority) parents and students remain displeased.

From the story:

[…] several parents said they were concerned by the school’s response. Some said they wished they had been notified in the morning with phone calls giving parents the option to keep children home. Others said students’ concerns were “brushed off” and “dismissed” by the administration. “Because they are minority students, the school district does not want to say, ‘We have a problem,’” Dayna Spence said, echoing the sentiments of several other parents who said they believe school officials do not value the concerns of minority students. Scanlon responded, “I know they’re speaking from emotion. I do not know what it’s like to be African American, because I’m not. My lens is from a 6-foot-2 white man. But I work very hard for cultural diversity and to eliminate racism.” … “It’s still nerve-wracking,” she said. “I feel like we’re going to get dirty looks.” The student said this incident was far from the first time she has been concerned for her well-being. “I’ve never felt safe at school,” she said. “The only time I feel safe is when I’m in that room with BSU” (Black Student Union). She said that during her freshman year, someone posted a picture on social media of a chocolate milk carton that had a stick-figure drawing of a lynching on it. The caption read, “Happy Black History Month,” the student recalled.

Scanlon said the district “talks about racial issues often” and uses “equity teams and cultural teams devoted to inclusion.” He added he plans to facilitate discussions about race with students in the days to come.

Hopefully, fake hate crime incidents will be among the topics … and not how they can be used as “conversation starters.”

"Several states have hate crimes laws, but specific statutes are not always used in race-related cases in many places. Ethnic intimidation — the legal term used to describe menacing or harassment acts based on a person’s race, religion or national origin — is generally hard to prove. Why?

Authorities have to show a person’s intents or motives were malicious in nature, The Morning Call, a Pennsylvania news outlet, reported. In other words, a judge or jury has to be convinced that there was some form or pattern of “hate” that motivated an action or crime.

Several of these intimidation cases also involve African-Americans being targeted, with incidents being examined by a criminal justice system that has historically been biased against people of color. Questions about privilege have been linked to cases where white defendants have subjected Blacks to some form of violence because of race.

In those rare instances when an ethnic intimidation charge gets prosecuted, there is still a burden of proof. A Ohio woman was facing the charge after having allegedly spray-painted the words, “Hail Trump” and the N-word on a home, the Toledo Blade reported Monday.

Community members, who have since covered up the hateful grattifi, discovered it on Saturday. Patricia Edelen, 47, was arraigned in Toledo Municipal Court on misdemeanor charges of ethnic intimidation, criminal mischief, criminal damaging and obstructing official business. The ethnic intimidation charge “increased the severity” of the other misdemeanor offenses, as intimidation is viewed as a more serious crime, the Blade reported. Edelen is slated to have a hearing at a later date and remains held in jail.

Authorities will have to prove that Edelen committed the criminal mischief, damages and obstruction to intimidate a person or people based on their race.

Edelen could still face a few years in jail as other defendants have in some other ethnic intimidation cases in recent years. A judge sentenced Robert T. Kujawa, a 45-year-old white man, to two to four years in state prison for the charge in May after he viciously harassed and stalked a Black family for years in Pennsylvania.

"Two men were killed Friday in Portland when they tried to stop an anti-Muslim rant on the MAX train at the Hollywood Transit Station, the Oregonian reported. Another man also suffered stab wounds, but he is expected to survive.

Police say that the suspect fled from the scene, but was eventually arrested in Northeast Portland.

The attack occurred in the mid-afternoon when the suspect, later identified to be 35-year-old Jeremy Joseph Christian, began yelling hate speech or biased language directed at two young women, one of whom was wearing a hijab, the Oregonian reported. Some good samaritans tried to intervene, but then the man ranting turned on them with a knife. One man died on the train, while the other passed away at the hospital.

These were folks just riding the train and unfortunately got caught up in this, Portland police spokesman Sgt. Pete Simpson said, according to the Oregonian

He was talking about a lot of different things, not just specifically anti-Muslim, Simpson said. We dont know if hes got mental health issues. We dont know if hes under the influence of drugs or alcohol or all of the above.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations condemned the incident Friday, referencing President Donald Trumps anti-immigrant rhetoric as a possible cause.

President Trump must speak out personally against the rising tide of Islamophobia and other forms of bigotry and racism in our nation that he has provoked through his numerous statements, policies and appointments that have negatively impacted minority communities, CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad said, Reuters reported.

Christian was booked Saturday morning into a Multnomah County jail on suspicion of aggravated murder and attempted murder, the Oregonian reported. A Facebook page under the suspects name connects him to an alt-right protest in Portland and shows that he was a part of violent online groups, the Oregonian reported.",1
"Relatives identified the slain teen as Nabra Hassanen, 17, right, of Reston, Va. (All Dulles Area Muslim Society Center) (N/A/ADAMS Center)

Hate is hate is hate.

That’s the bottom line. And it is rotting our country, no matter what flavor or shape it comes in.

The killing of 17-year-old Nabra Hassanen, whose body was found in a pond near her mosque in Northern Virginia after some sort of encounter with a motorist, is not being investigated as a hate crime, officials said Monday.

Officials are saying it’s being investigated as a road rage incident.

A hate crime, as we understand it, fits into a tight, legal narrative. It’s a crime motivated by prejudice — whether it’s based on race, religion, gender or sexual orientation.

And so far, investigators do not believe Nabra was picked out, targeted and killed specifically because she was a Muslim wearing an abaya, walking to her mosque. And it seems that she was not killed simply because she was a young woman walking outside in the darkness.

[Killing of Muslim teenager is being investigated as road-rage incident]

Officials say the suspect in her killing, Darwin Martinez Torres, was driving as a group that included Nabra was walking and riding bikes in and along the road. And then something, like road rage, happened.

But her mother said detectives have told her that Nabra was struck with a metal bat.

There is no doubt that hitting a 17-year-old girl with a bat and dumping her body in a pond would be an act born of hate, which is rage’s twin brother.

“An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us,” has never been more true. This is what House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R) said after a gunman opened fire on a GOP baseball practice last week in Alexandria.

Tragedy after tragedy, we puzzle through the labels and follow the common narratives to try to find the logic: Liberals hating Republicans? Muslims hating Christians? White hating black? Cats hating dogs?

But that doesn’t seem to always work. The nation is more than the Hatfields and McCoys.

Even if this was not a hate crime targeting Muslims, it has the effect of one.

The Muslim community in Virginia is nervous. This happened on the same weekend that an attacker crashed a car into a crowd outside a mosque in London. That appeared to be a very deliberate attack on Muslims.

Folks at the Virginia mosque, the All Dulles Area Muslim Society (ADAMS) in Sterling, are left to wonder whether they should provide deeper security and patrols during these last 10 days of Ramadan, because they may be targets of hate.

And all women wondered whether this means that this bedroom community is now a place that isn’t safe for them to walk around in.

And all parents of teens wondered if this is about teens no longer being safe in the suburban haven they moved their kids to.

And because Nabra is also African American, born in America to Egyptian immigrants, African Americans wondered whether this is another instance of them being targeted because of their race.

It really is an attack on all of us.

Loudoun County, in all its diversity, is seeing that.

Torres, the 22-year-old charged with Nabra’s killing, is Latino and doesn’t appear to have connected with any hate groups on his Facebook page. He doesn’t fit into the narrative we come to expect when faced with alleged hate crimes.

That may be why so many in Loudoun seem to have a heighten sense of fear.

“No one is looking at this as only a Muslim thing,” said Abdul Rashid Abdullah, a member of ADAMS whose son was at the mosque the night of the incident. “This is not just an attack on Muslims, it’s an attack on the entire community.”

In Britain, the van driver who plowed into a crowd was heard yelling that he wanted to kill Muslims.

[Van strikes crowd near London mosques in ‘terrorist attack’]

In Loudoun County, the man accused of killing Nabra was not reported to have said anything about her religion. But a Muslim teenage girl is dead. And we’re being told that some sort of road rage led to her death.

And what about the death of a patriotic and accomplished young man named Richard Collins III, who was standing on a curb at a Maryland college campus when he was fatally stabbed in May? Was that hate?

Or the deaths of two men who were fatally stabbed on a train in Portland, Ore., after trying to defend two women from a man making anti-Muslim statements? Was that hate?

Or what about the shootings on a baseball field in Alexandria, where a gunman asked whether the politicians practicing were Republicans or Democrats before he opened fire? Was that hate?

Hatred of all stripes is growing.

We watched it, stoked it with every debate that turned into an argument, fanned it with every Facebook meme that went just a bit too far, fueled it with every zero-sum approach to discourse and action. Courtesy is no longer the norm.

“That’s what’s wrong with America right now,” Abdullah said. “Not respecting your neighbor.”

Nabra was killed by some kind of toxic mix of hate and rage, there’s no doubt about that — even if it doesn’t meet the legal definition of a hate crime.

"Vacant lots, foreclosures, and blighted properties continue to be an eyesore for neighborhoods in southwest Atlanta and throughout Atlanta.  The City of East Point continues to take a stand against these properties and delinquent owners by demolishing blighted eyesores. East Points 50 Worst Properties Program is a compilation of 50 properties from each of the four Wards in the City that violate Fire Codes due to being a clear threat to human life, safety and/or health. Abandoned properties often are sought by vagrants to stay warm, and can be a haven for fires or a cesspool for crimes, says Fire Chief Rosemary R. Cloud.  The 50 Worst Properties Program provides an avenue to help ensure that neighborhoods remain safe from fire and crime, states the Fire Chief. The 50 Worst Properties Task Force has scheduled its next demolition of a home located at 1316 Walker Avenue for Saturday, May 18, 2013 at 8:00 A.M.. According to the fire department, the property was taken through a detailed process before reaching this last and final stage of a Municipal Court ordered demolition. This is the 3rd property demolition scheduled by the Task Force.  The Los Erken Apartments located on Central Avenue in East Point became the first property to be demolished in May of last year, followed by a Duplex on Lyle Avenue in October 2012.  This third demolition comes as the Task Force continues working to exhaust a 50 Worst Properties Phase II list, which was created after properties on the original list became compliant. According to a written statement by the East Point Fire Department, once a property is listed, it goes through a detailed process of 8 to 15 steps which includes, but is not limited to an inspection(s), locating and notifying the property owner, awaiting a response, and the issuance of a citation.  If the property owner does not respond, the property is then moved through a court process. The Task Force says additional demolitions can be expected.  How many blighted properties are in your neighborhood?  Do you want them demolished, or is there another idea?

"The unspeakable atrocities that are happening in South Sudan are unfathomable, not only because of the scope of savagery in the war between the Dinka and Nuer peoples, but also because it defies every tenet of our civilized being in which we take so much pride. Civilization, however, has hardly penetrated the first layer of our thick skin. We assume that our unprecedented advancements in technology, medicine, space exploration, engineering, literature and all forms of arts have equally deepened our moral and ethical conviction. No. We have in fact become increasingly immune and unmoved by the savagery which is unfolding before our eyes in so many countries.

Many judge the raging human atrocities—be that in South Sudan, Syria, Libya, Yemen, and many other places—in relative terms to the horrors of wars and the unprecedented violence of the last century and before. They argue that today’s world is better and safer than at any time in the history of mankind. That said, the idea of “Never Again,” adopted in the wake of the second World War, has become nothing but an empty slogan. Should we really measure our moral conduct today in relative terms to the moral decadence of yesteryears?

Go explain that to those who have suffered unmatched cruelty and brutality and found salvation only in death. To the starving little boy who is about to pass away from malnutrition; to the girl that was raped a dozen times and left to die; to the shattered father who lost his entire family; to the weeping mother whose child died in her arms.

Yes, go explain it to the tens of thousands of children who are about to perish because of lack of medical care; to the millions of traumatized refugees who lost hope of ever recovering again. Go explain to them, “You are better off today than the tens of millions who perished before you.”

The irony is that we often compare the human capacity for mercilessness, torture, and random killing to a wild beast, when in fact the most vicious of all beasts would be insulted to be compared to the atrocities and slaughter that humans are capable of committing against one another.

Let’s look at the tragedy that has gripped South Sudan.

Six million people—over half of the entire population—suffer from severe food shortages, some surviving on as little as a cup of rice per day. It is projected that in 2018, nearly 1.1 million South Sudanese children will still be acutely malnourished.

Armed forces use rape as a weapon of war. As a method of coercion, girls as young as seven are raped and burned alive in front of their parents. Rape is often used as a payment for services and a recruitment incentive for militias. Gang rape is so prevalent it is now considered normal, while pillaging leaves villages in a blood bath.

Nearly 7,000 new cases of cholera have been reported this year—a 73 percent increase from 2016 and the highest number of cases since 2014—and 51 percent of all infected are children and teenagers. Hospitals and aid vehicles are intentionally targeted by militia forces, and volunteers are ambushed and killed.

The malaria rate has increased from last year, accounting for 65 percent of all illnesses. Approximately 78,000 people are infected every week, most of whom are under the age of five. In 2017, more than 1.57 million cases of malaria have been reported, which is an increase of 300,000 over 2016.

Tens of thousands of children have been recruited as child soldiers, carrying rifles taller than themselves. Children travel unaccompanied – separated from their families after villages are raided – and many of them end up dying in the wilderness. Women and children hide in swamps while bodies pile in front of them. A whole new generation is lost, as nationwide 51 percent of South Sudanese children are not attending school.

Men are slaughtered, and some have been locked in steel shipping containers beneath the sun without food or water, left to fry to death. Women are captured, forced to march, and raped nightly, while civilians, who are not actively involved in the hostilities, are targeted as a military tactic.

Ethnic cleansing between the Dinka and Nuer is spreading across the country, with many observers warning that it is now approaching the level of genocide. The UN confirms that ethnic cleansing by way of starvation, gang rape, and village burning has become the status quo, and as a result, nearly two million people have been internally displaced since 2013.

Arms are pouring across the South Sudanese border by merchants of death—China and Russia—who are refusing to impose an embargo on exporting their killing machines. More than 50 percent of the national budget is spent on arms and bloated military salaries.

Given all this unfolding horror, what is most disturbing and outrageous is that the international community has not only forfeited its moral obligation by not taking every measure to mitigate the conflict, but proved its miserable failure to provide the necessary funding to save the lives of hundreds of thousands of starving and sick children who are on the verge of dying.

The total humanitarian aid given to South Sudan in 2017 is nearly $1.5 billion, which has not been nearly enough to avert a total catastrophe. Of that, while nearly $1 billion was contributed by the U.S., the rest of the international community provided only the remaining $500 million combined.

As a case in point, although the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) required U.S. $181 million in 2017 for the Humanitarian Action for Children (HAC) for South Sudan, only 75 per cent was funded. As a result, there is significant underfunding in the Health, Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) sectors, which is to the detriment of children that could otherwise survive.

Where is the UN Security Council, which can pass enforceable resolutions to end the violent hostilities but has demonstrated nothing but ineptitude and self-serving political wrangling? Where are the leaders of the free world, who roll out the haughty concept of human rights but shamelessly are not moved by the outcry of the shattered people? This death and destruction will leave behind a stigma that Western powers will have to bear. As George Bernard Shaw observed, “The worst sin towards our fellow creatures is not to hate them, but to be indifferent to them: that’s the essence of inhumanity.”

Yes, I know how hard it is to go into a war zone, where a war of extermination is raging. How sad and how disgraceful it is, though, that the countries capable of mitigating this disastrous civil war are sitting on their hands and claim to be civilized, when in fact savagery is still flowing in their veins.",1

"LEDA director stepping down

Founder and executive director of the Lakeshore Ethnic Diversity Alliance, Gail Harrison, is retiring at the end of July 2017 after being at the helm for more than 20 years.

Harrison founded the organization in 1996, in response to a hate crime committed in the Grand Haven area. Since then, the Lakeshore Ethnic Diversity Alliance has worked to advance racial equity through signature, research-based programs such as Calling All Colors, the Summit on Race and Inclusion, Migrant Mentoring, Talking to Kids about Race and Racial Equity Institutes.

The nonprofit also has been the recipient of several W. K. Kellogg Foundation grants and has been recognized as a nationwide model.

The Lakeshore Ethnic Diversity Alliance works to dismantle barriers to ensure people of all ethnic backgrounds have equal access and opportunity to participate fully in the life of the community.

Harrison has promoted dialogue on inclusion and racial equity along the lakeshore for the duration of her tenure.

Harrison is working with LEDAs board of directors to help make a smooth transition in leadership. A national search for Harrison’s successor will be conducted later this spring.",1
"A FORMER soldier has walked free from court after targeting Muslims on social media in a hate crime.

Geoffrey Reynolds, 53, of Dugard Avenue, Colchester, sent seven tweets in the days following the Manchester Arena bombing earlier this year.

In them, he told members of the Muslim community he was “trained and ready” for any of those who were set to “try it on”.

He also posted a picture of a man on a toilet with the words “The Koran, now in two ply”.

Reynolds admitted one charge of sending offensive public communications on May 27 at Colchester Magistrates’ Court yesterday.

Hendrika Tatum, prosecuting, said: “These took place five days after the Manchester bombing. On that day, a PC became aware of a Twitter account in the name of the defendant.

“The account showed it was located in Colchester.”

Among the Tweets was another which stated: “When will we fight back?”

The court heard Reynolds had no previous convictions and was a man of previous good character.

Ralph Piggott, mitigating, said Reynolds had been under undue stress from his job as a manager at a bottled drinks factory and his family life and had turned to alcohol.

He said: “It may be no one in the world saw what he was writing but clearly it is an offence which does have culpability.

“He maintains he is not a racist, not an Islamaphobe and he is to be credited he has researched the Muslim religion and says he now realises there to be good and bad in all religions.

“He is very regretful and ashamed of what he has done.”

Reynolds, who served in the Army for five years, sighed in court when he was sentenced to 12 weeks imprisonment, which was suspended for a year.

He was told he would have faced an 18 week sentence following CPS upscaling hate crime sentences recently, but it was reduced due to his early guilty plea.

He was also fined £750 and ordered to pay £85 costs and a £115 victim surcharge.

In August, it was announced the CPS would be cracking down on online hate crime and upping it to stop it from leading to extremist hate.

Twenty two people lost their lives in the Manchester Arena bombing on May 22. The attacker also died.",1

"When Chris Ver-Haest left a friend’s house in north London on 16 July 2017 he was going to buy cigarettes and water from the local shop. It was 10.45am on a Sunday. He would never return. He had stayed at the house the previous night after an impromptu farewell party – a last hurrah before moving to Madrid. He was beaming. The possibilities of what lay ahead stretched out like a childhood summer holiday. There was another reason to beam: Amid the evening’s wine and laughter he had met a young man. They kissed. They planned to meet up again. But 15 minutes after leaving the house, he would be lying in the road in a foetal position. His right leg would be broken in four places; his ankle smashed. He never made it to Madrid. Instead, five months later, Ver-Haest would be standing in a nearby court testifying against the man responsible, who would be facing a charge just below attempted murder: grievous bodily harm with intent. His name is Kamil Snios. He had ensured that Ver-Haest paid for Snios’s hatred of gay men with almost everything he has. Ver-Haest’s leg has not recovered. It never will. The hostility gay people face had never been a particular preoccupation for Ver-Haest. Being Chinese-British, it was racist abuse he suffered growing up, and when he heard about homophobic hate crimes the magnitude of what they meant did not register properly. Ver-Haest changed a lot in 15 minutes. Five weeks after the attack, he sits on a bench in east London with his smashed, swollen leg stretched out, describing the events and its aftermath to BuzzFeed News. His was just one of 80,000 hate crime incidents in the last year, with 1 in 5 LGBT people saying they have been targeted. Ver-Haest wants others to know what such hatred does and from where it comes. “There needs to be a way that people really see what’s happening,” he says. There is something else, though, that emerges during the hours we spend together: a picture of hatred’s inverse. People helped Ver-Haest in ways he could never have imagined. And when he took to the witness stand, there was someone still rooting for him, months later: the young man he met the night before the attack. This is a story about hate and love, and how they derail everything.

On the weekend of 15 July, Ver-Haest, 36, was only back in London for a few days before heading to Madrid. After nearly 20 years working in hospitality he needed a complete change, something that would help people develop. He had embarked on a course to teach English as a foreign language. “I wanted to do something more rewarding,” he says on the bench in Hackney five weeks after the attack, in a clearing set back from the roadside. He wears shorts and a white shirt. He looks younger than his age but has a gently confident voice that carries a sort of refined authority. It is the beginning of what would become a five-month conversation. At this stage, Ver-Haest speaks in an almost detached, factual way, shifting between past and present tense. He talks about growing up in Suffolk and London, and says his family background was complicated. Depression beset him as a young child. He starts to describe the events leading up to the attack. With his teacher training completed and a job secured in Madrid, Ver-Haest was on his way to a new life. He thought nothing of the get together that night in Tottenham: old friends mostly, but with some of their friends too. One of whom was the man he kissed. His name is Santiago. Although only 20, he was more than attractive, and intriguing enough to pique Ver-Haest’s interest. There was another man he hardly knew there too, a straight man called Adam. The next morning Adam and Ver-Haest set off up Stamford Road, just off Broad Lanes, to pick up supplies from a corner shop. On the way they noticed something unusual: a house party still raging on the first floor of a nearby building. Noise was wafting from the balcony. As they passed by, chatting, Ver-Haest gave Adam an affectionate pat on the back: the gesture of a newfound friend. They picked up milk, water, and cigarettes, and started heading back. “As soon as we get onto Stamford Road, he [Kamil Snios] is on the opposite side of the street and walks directly towards us. He looked like he was on a mission.” Snios was muscular and broad-set with a shaved head, jeans, trainers, and a navy zip top. As he neared the two men he jutted his arm out straight from the shoulder, holding a cap in his hand: an odd gesture, Ver-Haest thought. “He looked wired, in a kind of tunnel vision, like he’d been up drinking all night.” Ver-Haest also thinks drugs were in his system, so crazed and otherworldly was his demeanour. “He said, ‘Have we got a problem?’ I was closest to him, and was like, ‘No mate’ – trying to not engage or make eye contact. The cap was about head height from me and he hit me in the face with it. Then he starts shouting and pushing.” The shouting was in Polish – Snios’s mother tongue – so Ver-Haest did not know what he was saying nor have time to consider what was about to happen. “He kicked my right leg.” This was not an ordinary kick, he says, but one so precise and destructive that it seemed to him to be a learned, specialist technique with one purpose: to obliterate. It knocked Ver-Haest to the ground. “I didn’t register the level of pain,” he says, “but he broke the leg straight away.” It fractured right through. This was just the beginning. Snios kept kicking. He focused on one target: Ver-Haest’s lower right leg. He kicked and kicked, below the knee, across the shin, around the ankle, again and again and again, a frenzy of strikes, breaking and smashing each bone, one by one.

Google Kamil Snios

In between, Snios grabbed their bag of shopping and threw it to the floor. At first, Ver-Haest had no idea what the motivation was. “I didn’t really know what was happening apart from me being on the floor and thinking, ‘I need to get up and get away.’ But when I tried to get up I couldn’t understand why my leg was just buckling.” A passerby – a middle-aged man – tried to intervene and help Ver-Haest and Adam, but gauging the ferocity of the attack, quickly left. When Ver-Haest did manage to stand up on his left leg, Snios reacted quickly. “He came over and kicked that one out, so I’m on the floor again.” Ver-Haest tried again, but each time Snios would knock him back down. As he was doing this, another man was shouting in Polish from the nearby first-floor balcony where the party noise had emanated. “He was cheering him on, whooping like it was some kind of spectator sport, laughing every time he sees me get knocked over.” A conversation ensued between Snios and his cheerleader – a type of call and response, again in Polish, but the overall meaning of which was clear to Ver-Haest. The other man was encouraging him, goading him, revelling in every blow.

He was cheering him on, whooping like it was some kind of spectator sport

“He was so excited and elated to be seeing what he was seeing,” he says, as if “this is the best entertainment ever”. When Ver-Haest was on the ground, incapacitated, Snios turned on Adam. “He got him on the floor once or twice – same move,” he says referring to the kick. But it did not land in the same way, failing to break Adam’s leg, leaving him able to stand up again. “At some point Adam is able to come and help me,” says Ver-Haest. “I put my arm around his shoulder and tried to lightly put my foot on the ground and it’s so painful I pulled the two of us over. I tried to do it again. Snios comes over and kicks my leg again. I tried putting my arm around Adam’s shoulder two or three times but we just ended up on the floor, either because Snios kicked us down or I couldn’t take the pain.” Ver-Haest tried reasoning with Snios, telling him his leg was broken, to stop, that they would go away. “I was trying not to appear like too much of a victim.” He then climbed on Adam’s back hoping they could escape that way. “But my foot is loose, it’s bobbing around and that’s so painful I pull us down because I can’t take it. I can feel the bones moving in there; it’s completely loose.” What Snios did not know was that from this point a local resident was filming the incident on a mobile phone. Ver-Haest resorted to crawling; dragging himself along the ground by his hands, with Adam helping, pulling him – anything to try to escape round the corner. But then another element to the attack crept in. “Snios comes up and because I’m in that [sitting] position his crotch is at my head height. He starts to unbuckle his trousers. I didn’t know what he’s saying because it’s in Polish but the tone has changed.” Despite the language barrier, Ver-Haest sensed what Snios was saying. It was, he says, a threat of sexual violence but with the snarling suggestion that Ver-Haest would enjoy it, as if to say: This is what you want, isn’t it? “Something stopped him,” says Ver-Haest – he did not undo his trousers any further. And seemingly exhausted after such a sustained attack, Snios took the cigarettes Ver-Haest had just bought, waved them over his head in a way that one of the officers later described as “like a trophy” and walked off, back towards the block of flats. Ver-Haest and Adam managed to drag themselves around the corner. But still only 50 metres away, Ver-Haest was terrified Snios would come back for them. Adam rang for an ambulance. A few minutes later, a passing police car stopped to help. They called for assistance – the culprit was dangerous and still just metres away. Another two police cars arrived soon after. Armed with a description of both Snios and the man cheering from the balcony, four officers went into the building to make an arrest. Meanwhile, Ver-Haest was being stretchered into an ambulance and driven to Homerton hospital. There an officer took his statement as doctors cut his trousers and put his leg into traction.

Laura Gallant / BuzzFeed

“They had two people extending my leg out to try to get all my bones in a relatively straight position and then the third person applied all the plaster of Paris,” he says. X-rays revealed multiple, complete fractures in his tibia and fibula bones, which lead from the knee to the ankle: a displaced fracture to his distal tibia, a displaced fracture to the tibia shaft, and a displaced fracture to the proximal fibula. As well as the clean breaks there were splinters of bone unattached, with the ankle smashed into fragments. It would take major surgery to hold everything together. But first, late that night, as Ver-Haest lay in his hospital bed, he received a phone call from a police officer that would confirm his suspicion: They were targeted for a reason.

“He said they’d caught the guy [Snios] and was shocked because he admitted very clearly what his motivation was. He said he had seen us walking down the street and thought we were a gay couple and was disgusted by it, and that’s why he did it. The police officer said he’d never heard anything like that in his 17 years.” It wasn’t the homophobia itself that was new to the officer. It was, says Ver-Haest, the fact that he had never known anyone to believe so completely that they were in the right. But it was a confession, not only to the violence but also to the motivation. There was now no doubt: This was a hate crime. Two days later, Santiago, the guy Ver-Haest had met at the party, came to visit him in hospital. His presence would prove transformative over the coming days and weeks. The surgery on Ver-Haest’s leg required a titanium nail to be inserted down the length of his tibia, with a succession of screws in his leg and ankle clamping fragments of bone together. Extensive physiotherapy would be necessary almost immediately. But the nurses, he says, were late giving him painkillers before the first session.

“Half an hour later, the physio gives me this [walking] frame and I manage to get up slowly, support myself on the frame but it’s blindingly painful. I get about five feet away before I need to get back.” At the end of the session, knowing what the intensity of the pain was about to unleash, Ver-Haest asked the physio to close the curtain. “I got as small as I could and wept for half an hour,” he says. “It was devastating.” There was only one thing that helped him cope. “I thought about the guy I’d met at the party,” he says. “I thought about his face. That simple joy of meeting someone as lovely as he was, was the only refuge I could find at that point.” Ver-Haest was in hospital – on seven types of medication – for five days before the next stage: recuperation. His surgeon said at the time that although the injuries could take a year to heal, ending any hope of moving to Spain in the near future, they would eventually do so. Ver-Haest had no idea how optimistic this prognosis would prove to be. And to begin with he had to grapple with the volume of practical obstacles lining up.

I got as small as I could and wept for half an hour

Having given up the lease on his flat to move to Madrid, Ver-Haest now had nowhere to live, and without the job in Spain or the ability to work due to his injury, no money. He took to staying with a succession of friends, a week here, two weeks there, sitting all day on their sofa, watching television with his leg elevated, trying to take care of himself. Santiago would come to visit him wherever he was. “That’s been truly lovely,” says Ver-Haest. “He was totally there and had to sit and try to support me.” But no one could be there all the time, when the daily struggles of having an unusable leg, surgical boot, and crutches became overwhelming. Ver-Haest had to relearn everything: how to wash, cook, shop, and eat. “I could heat something in a microwave but can I get it to where I want to eat it? No. I have to eat standing on one leg or perched on the counter holding it in one hand.” On one occasion, after heating soup in a microwave he tried to carry it to the sofa, but dropped it, scalding himself. His crutches slipped on the spilt liquid, flooring him once again. When he describes his attempts to seek help from the agencies designed to assist, it conjures the same image: crutches slipping. An automated text arrived from Victim Support shortly after the attack informing him the agency would contact him properly within seven days. It did not. When Ver-Haest eventually got through he was offered phone counselling. But he was in a supermarket when the counsellor rang. “I said, can you please call back in five minutes? They said, ‘No. How about I call you next Thursday?’” That was nine days later. They did not call him the following Thursday, he says, but five days after that – two weeks later. He lodged a formal complaint and received an apology but for Ver-Haest it was too late. Meanwhile, Galop, the organisation for victims of homophobic hate crime, was understanding and supportive, he says, but was only able to signpost him to other services. One of which was housing and employment benefits. “They [the government] have said they’re going to pay me ESA [employment and support allowance], which is £73 per week,” he says, “but I haven’t had anything yet. I don’t know what they expected me to do for these first two months of having no money coming in.” Without a credit card, he says, he would be destitute. His debt began to rise; he set up a GoFundMe page. And with no housing benefit, no savings for a deposit on a rented flat, compensation for such injuries taking months to arrive, and a social housing shortage, there was only one option, a housing charity suggested to Ver-Haest: Go to a homeless shelter. At this point, a couple he had only met four times stepped in. They offered him their spare room for free. “It’s really touching,” he says, his voice cutting out for the first time. “They’re a straight couple. They came to see me one time and brought me flowers, chocolates, took me out to lunch, and then offered me this room. I was bowled over.” A couple of months later, Ver-Haest’s brother took over, letting him live in a flat he owned but had been renting out, encouraging Ver-Haest, where possible, to make improvements to the place – a project to rebuild his strength. It renewed their relationship. Psychologically, the ripples from the attack have been complex. When we first meet, Ver-Haest is focusing on the practical, being matter-of-fact and coping well. But a few weeks before the trial, he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder – PTSD.

“I was having panic attacks,” he says in December. “Anxiety. Hyper-vigilance. Flashbacks.” He says he would start to panic in public, as if the world he once perceived as benign or at least indifferent was now a potentially constant threat. Waiting in tube stations, he would become terrified that someone would push him in front of the train. “I am altered by this,” he says. “I have a lot of work to do to get things back.” He has begun receiving therapy, alongside regular physiotherapy. But some of the damage is less tangible, and deeper, cutting to the heart of what a hate crime does. “Before this happened I didn’t live in fear that I would be attacked for my sexuality,” he says. “I felt like I didn’t have to define myself through my sexuality. But now I have to think about it. I have to think about how this affects everyone. It’s not just gay people who might be attacked – my friend wasn’t gay and he was attacked.” He thinks many in the wider public who haven’t experienced such a crime will share his previous ignorance of the consequences. This need for a wider understanding, he says, is what has moved him to speak out. “It has devastated this period in my life,” he says. “I’m living this every day. It affects everything I do. I’m 100% reliant on other people. I can’t work at the moment and everything I think about doing in the future is affected by this.”

Im living this every day. It affects everything I do”

He pauses for a moment, and returns to Snios and the forthcoming court case. “He needs to pay for it.” But it isn’t only about Snios. There was also the man on the balcony, who has never been found. Ver-Haest is confused and frustrated that the police did not find and arrest him alongside Snios when they went into the flat. But the reasons for this and for the attack itself soon become clear.

On 18 December, Snios’s trial began at Wood Green crown court. At an initial hearing in August, he had pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of grievous bodily harm (GBH) but not guilty to the much graver one of GBH with intent: a crime that denotes the perpetrator not only inflicted considerable injury but meant to do so.

BuzzFeed News Wood Green Crown Court

GBH with intent is considerably harder to prove and carries a much higher sentence of up to 16 years in jail. For Ver-Haest, ensuring Snios was found guilty of intent and locked up for as long as possible, to prevent further attacks, was crucial. In the courtroom, Snios was led into the dock in a grey sweatshirt and jeans. Ver-Haest stood behind a curtain to give evidence – visible to the jury but not to Snios, who sat impassive throughout, staring straight ahead, his chin tilted upwards. Ver-Haest recounted everything that happened on 16 July: the slapping, the kicking, the jeering from the balcony: “He’s kicking me everywhere…there was so much pain…I hit the floor again and the pain is so much worse; blinding like a flash of light.” The video footage was shown to the court. It begins near the end of the attack. Ver-Haest is on the ground, trying in vain to get up, with Snios standing over him, with laughing bellowing over the scene from the balcony. But it is only when Detective Constable Mark Nicholls, the officer in charge of the case, takes to the stand that what lies beneath it all is revealed. Nicholls and the prosecution barrier read the transcript of the police interview the day Snios was arrested. It was translated from Polish. The interview began with Snios saying he had been drinking since 6pm the previous day, and had also smoked cannabis. He confirmed that he had moved to London from Poland three years ago and works in removals. That morning, he said: “I came across two boys who were showing me strange things…motions and movements that are typical of ladies.” The men, Adam and Ver-Haest, were “behaving like poofs”. He continued trying to describe what he saw in the men and adds, “Let’s just call them by their names. They’re poofs…they offended me.” Nicholls asked him how they offended him. Snios mentioned a “kiss and a hand gesture”, adding, “This is inhuman.” Being a homosexual man is, asked DC Nicholls, inhuman? “Yes.” Where does this hatred come from? “It’s not hatred,” Snios replied. Instead, he said, “It’s a deliberate provocation.” So any form of homosexual act is inhuman and unacceptable? “Yes.” Did they kiss in front of you? “No,” said Snios, adding that it’s “not normal for guys to kiss where children are around” and “I don’t have anything against them but I don’t want them showing it off.” He was, he said, “provoked”. Snios refused to believe that Ver-Haest’s leg had been broken, denied that anyone had been shouting or cheering from the balcony, and refused to give up the names of the men who had been in the flat. Without his cooperation and with several people there, the police were unable to find the man on the balcony. When Snios took to the witness stand the following day, speaking through an interpreter throughout, he made an extraordinary case, using a line of defence now notorious in legal and LGBT circles: the gay panic defence. In the 1990s and early 2000s in the United States in particular, some people accused of murdering gay men claimed they did it because the victim made a pass at them and they panicked, attacking reflexively. It worked on some occasions, leading to acquittals, which sparked widespread outrage. In English law, this is not a valid defence. But in court, Snios claimed – having not mentioned it in the police interview – that that morning when he saw Adam and Ver-Haest they were waving and gesturing to Snios and one of them “bent over and smacked his bottom”. They were, said Snios, “trying to propose something” and that he went over to try to find out what, when a fight ensued. The comments he made during the police interview about gay men being inhuman were, he said in court, a “misunderstanding”. Asked about the fact that he cried towards the end of his police interview, Snios replied: “I feel sorry for my children because they are hurting the most.” His tears were not for Ver-Haest. No one mentioned in court that Adam is straight, and that as such it would make the chances of him and Ver-Haest propositioning Snios zero. Snios’s barrister did, however, argue that her client could not be homophobic because he has twice been to gay pride. At the end of the three-day trial the prosecution read out a statement from Ver-Haest. It described the impact the attack has had: the movements he can no longer make, the pain that still rages and keeps him awake, the medications he still has to take, the jobs he cannot accept, the fear and vulnerability he feels in public every day. Only then did Snios look ashamed. After three and a half hours of deliberation the jury returned on Tuesday this week with a unanimous verdict: guilty. Sentencing Snios on Wednesday morning, the trial judge, Gregory Perrins, told him: “You believed they were homosexual and attacked them for that reason. This was a crime of hate.”

“You believed they were homosexual and attacked them for that reason. This was a crime of hate”

He added that he rejected the suggestion from the defence barrister that Snios did not have a problem with gay people, reminding the defendant that he told police he considered their perceived sexuality “inhuman”. Such views are “repugnant and vile”, he said, and “have no place in a modern, tolerant society”. The judge concluded Snios “showed no remorse” and sentenced him to 10 years in prison. Afterwards, Ver-Haest tells BuzzFeed News how relieved he was, how much it meant to secure a sentence of this length. He then texts his reaction in full: “It’s hard to take in… Both of us will live with the results of his hatred and cruelty for the rest of our lives. I don’t hold out much hope for his improvement whilst serving his sentence but at least he’ll have time to consider his actions.” Ver-Haest begins updating BuzzFeed News on his medical situation. His consultant has changed the prognosis for his leg. “It will never be the same again,” says Ver-Haest. The movement in his ankle in particular will not return to how it was before. And, said the doctor, in 20 years the cartilage surrounding what was operated on will degrade leaving him with osteoarthritis. “The trauma wasn’t really what happened,” he says. “The trauma is what I face every day – the aftermath.”

The car was moving well below the speed limit, and it had heavy front-end damage and missing front tires, according to Riverside police. The officer stopped the car in the 2600 block of Harlem, and the driver told him hed been in a crash, but he couldnt remember exactly where, other than it was within a couple blocks of the traffic stop. The driver, identified as Marco A. Nieves, 46 of the 5800 block of North Spaulding Avenue in Chicago, smelled of alcohol, according to Riverside police, and his speech was slurred, and his eyes were glassy. Nieves failed all of the field sobriety tests he performed, and he was arrested for drunken driving, police reported. He told the Riverside officer he had been drinking before he started driving, but he refused a Brethalyzer test. Riverside and North Riverside police officers searched the area for the crash location, and they found Nieves had hit a pole and fled the scene at Harlem and Cermak in North Riverside, police reported. Nieves had blood on his shirt when he was stopped, but he refused medical assistance. A background check shows Nieves was already currently suspended for a past DUI, in which he was arrested Aug. 22 by Elmwood Park police. Riverside police contacted felony review and enhanced the charge to aggravated driving under the influence, a class 4 felony. He was also charged by North Riverside police for the hit-and-run crash. He was cited for failure to reduce speed to avoid an accident, failure to report an accident to police authority and operation of an uninsured motor vehicle. Nievess criminal history includes 19 past arrests and convictions, including theft, assault, obstruction of justice, traffic offenses, burglary and damage to property, police reported.

"Mike Pont via Getty Images Shutting down trolls, one tweet at a time.

Anthony Bourdain has no time for fake news.

The CNN host shut down former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke after he accused Bourdain of promoting white genocide.

Duke tweeted out a clip from Bourdain’s show, “Parts Unknown,” and said the celebrity chef was encouraging both the extermination and genocide of white people in the video.

Exterminating the White race is the only hope, according to (((Anthony Bourdain))). For those who question #WhiteGenocide. Here it is. https://t.co/fnWV6Fkeev — David Duke (@DrDavidDuke) March 3, 2017

In the clip provided from the June 5, 2016 episode set in Cologne, Germany, Bourdain and fellow chef René Stessl discuss refugees in Europe ― not white genocide, like Duke’s tweet implied.

#AnthonyBourdain tells the world that whites must replace Jews before Jews replace whites. #NewRight https://t.co/vKL3vLDSVH — Counter-Currents (@NewRightAmerica) March 3, 2017

Bourdain called out Duke’s tweet and offered to “rearrange” the former KKK leader’s extremities.

Genocide? Extermination? Im against! But Id be happy to rearrange your knee or other extremities. https://t.co/NrBDvlfc4u — Anthony Bourdain (@Bourdain) March 3, 2017

Considering Bourdain is avid follower of Brazilian jiu jitsu, he could probably do just that.

Duke later tweeted back at the CNN host, repeating his lie:

"A Levittown man who fatally slapped a fellow prisoner in the head last year in Bucks County jail has been sentenced to serve two and a half to five years in state prison, the District Attorneys office announced Monday. Christopher Sean Williams, 38, pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter, simple assault, and intimidation of a witness in the Oct. 12 death of Donald Tommy Rush, 57, of Chalfont. According to the District Attorneys office, Williams admitted that he hit Rush with an open hand after he had woken him up from a nap by talking with his cellmate. Rush collapsed and died seven hours after the assault. His autopsy showed he died of bleeding in his brain caused by the slap to his head. Bucks County Judge Diane E. Gibbons accepted a plea agreement in which Williams would be sentenced to two and one-half to five years, the longest sentence possible for that crime. Williams told Gibbons that he never intended to cause such a severe injury to Rush, and apologized to his daughter.

"CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA — The man accused of driving through a crowd of peaceful counter-protesters at a Charlottesville white nationalist rally last August, killing one person and injuring several others, has been indicted on hate crime charges, according to the Department of Justice. James Alex Fields Jr., 21, of Maumee, Ohio was indicted on 30 counts, including federal hate crime charges.

Fields was indicted by a federal grand jury in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia in Charlottesville on Wednesday. Fields was charged with one count of a hate crime act resulting in the death of Heather Heyer and 28 counts of of hate crime acts causing bodily injury and involving an attempt to kill.

Heyer, 32, was a paralegal who joined the scores of counter-protesters in Charlottesville last August to demonstrate against the neo-Nazis and white supremacists who descended on the Virginia city to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee.

Those who knew Heyer described her as compassionate and her mother, Susan Bro, said she had a very strong sense of right and wrong.

Fields was also charged with one count of racially motivated violent interference with a federally protected activity (18 U.S.C. § 245(b)(2)), resulting in the death of Heather Heyer, for driving his car into a crowd of protestors on a downtown street in Charlottesville, Virginia.

The indictment alleges that after an unlawful assembly was declared, Field returned to this car and soon after drove to the vicinity of Fourth and East Market streets in downtown Charlottesville. He then drove his car onto Fourth Street, a narrow, downhill, one-way street, the indictment says. The DOJ says a racially and ethnically diverse crowd was gathered at the bottom of the hill.

Fields slowly proceeded towards the crowd before he stopped and observed them while idling in his car, the indictment alleges.

Many of the individuals in the crowd were chanting and carrying signs promoting equality and protesting against racial and other forms of discrimination, the DOJ said in a press release.



The indictment alleges Fields slowly reversed his car to the top of the hill and then rapidly accelerated, ran through a stop sign and across a raised pedestrian mall, and drove directly into the crowd, striking numerous individuals, killing Heather Heyer, and injuring many others.

His car stopped when it struck another and then he fled the scene, the indictment says.

The rally in Charlottesville was marked with violence and deadly clashes that culminated with the car attack that left Heyer dead. As public figures and lawmakers condemned the bigotry and the hatred on the part of the neo-Nazis and white supremacists that arrived in Charlottesville for the rally, President Trump said his administration condemns such displays on many sides. City officials said 35 people were injured in events related to the rally. Two Virginia State troopers were also killed in a helicopter crash as they helped monitor events at the deadly rally.

Jason Kessler, the organizer of the Unite The Right rally, was recently given a permit by the National Park Service for a white civil rights in Washington D.C. The rally would take place Aug. 11-12, on the anniversary of the Charlottesville rally.

"Another year. Another Sept. 11 anniversary. Another opportunity for grievance-mongering Muslim agitators to decry the imagined “epidemic” of “Islamophobia.”

South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT) convened with Mad Maxine Waters and other House Democrats in Washington, D.C., to mark a somber occasion this week. No, not the coordinated jihadi mass murder of nearly 3,000 innocent people of all races, nationalities and religions on 9/11. Instead, they lamented Sept. 12 – “the 16-year anniversary of the day that South Asian, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu, Arab, and Middle Eastern Americans woke up to a new political reality in which the safety of our lives and the security of our homes were irrevocably compromised.”

For left-wing zealots, the bloody lash of worldwide Islamic terrorism pales in comparison to the so-called “backlash” against Muslims. SAALT disseminated prefab tweets and declarations naming President Trump, outspoken anti-Shariah activist Brigitte Gabriel and her grass-roots group, ACT for America, as well as “law enforcement, immigration enforcement, vigilantes” and “white supremacists” as their enemies.

They’re all the same to the tolerance mob.

And “backlash” is a catchall trash can for everything from sideward glances to off-color jokes to offensive cartoons to unresolved crimes to actual acts of intimidation or physical violence. Mixed in with two shootings and a stabbing over the past year classified as hate crimes, SAALT noted that in August, “a Minnesota mosque was firebombed in what the governor rightly declared an ‘act of terrorism.”

One of those things is not like the other. I contacted the FBI this week to ask about the Minnesota mosque incident. It is unsolved after more than a month, and a $30,000 reward for information remains unclaimed. An agent based in Minneapolis acknowledged to me that “it’s always a possibility” that the crime may be a hoax.

That’s what the Sept. 12 gripers want you to forget: People lie. And too many Muslim opportunists deceive in order to distract and divide.

Just two weeks ago, an alleged hate crime fell apart after a 22-year-old Muslim man admitted he had “exaggerated” an assault in a Durham, Ontario, park restroom. Canadian police dropped charges against a 57-year-old man whom the Muslim man claimed had shouted anti-Muslim epithets and punched him in the face.

“We could have charged him with obstructing police or mischief and he was cautioned for those two offenses,” a police official told the Toronto Sun. But the faker escaped without punishment.

In late August, Indiana State University professor Azhar Hussain received one year’s probation for fabricating anti-Muslim threats and an assault. He pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of obstruction for justice and harassment after lying to cops this spring about being attacked and sending anti-Muslim hate mails to the school.

“Based upon the investigation, it is our belief that Hussain was trying to gain sympathy by becoming a victim of anti-Muslim threats, which he had created himself,” the campus police chief concluded.

In June, a small fire at a Des Moines, Iowa, mosque generated national headlines – until a young Muslim woman was arrested for starting it.

“Security cameras in the mosque showed a woman, later identified as Aisha Ismail, 22, pouring lighter fluid on the carpet and then starting the fire,” police reported. “It doesn’t appear that she was trying to burn the place down,” the local chief said. “It seems like she was trying to make a statement.”

In Houston, a “suspicious” fire at a Houston mosque in 2015 turned out to have been set by one of the center’s own worshipers who prayed there five times a day for five years. The unindicted terror-funding co-conspirators at CAIR-Houston had clamored for law enforcement authorities to “investigate a possible bias motive for this fire” due to “the recent spike in hate incidents targeting mosques nationwide.”

That same year, New Yorker Kashif Parvaiz was convicted of murdering his wife in front of his child after police debunked his cover story of being attacked by a group of bigots who called the family “terrorists.”

For every rare and bona fide act of “Islamophobia” in North America, there are multiple acts of Islamo-faux-bia ginned up to stir attention, milk public compassion and generate unfounded fear.

It’s bad enough when the Islamo-faux-bists operate any other time of year. It’s downright disgusting when they exploit the true horrors of 9/11 to hype their delusions of systemic post-9/12 oppression and collective victimhood.",1
"ORANGEVALE (CBS13) — Sacramento Sheriff’s Department is investigating a potential hate crime after a series of anti-semitic posters were found pasted to the side of Temple Or Rishon in Orangevale.

Everyone on edge as police investigate what could be labeled a hate crime.

Hurtful, hateful and plastered on the walls. That’s what members of Temple OrRishon walked into this morning. A series of anti-semitic posters, referencing Hitler, the daily stormer, and Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof. The first to see the disturbing images, kids, who came in early to decorate for a dance.

“To be targeted like this and discriminated against it’s disheartening, it’s sad.” said Kimberly Olker, President of Temple OrRishon.

The suspects hit the Orangevale temple in the early morning hours. It’s the first time this particular temple has been targeted but police are treating the incident with the utmost seriousness.

The Sacramento Sheriff’s Department says they are looking into whether or not the crime will be considered a hate crime, and while understandably shaken Temple leaders say one thing they absolutely won’t do is let hate win.

“We join together when this happens though. We all feel the pain together. And we don’t stop. We don’t stop what we’re doing.” said Olker.

Temple leaders say they do have surveillance camera’s but it’s unclear what may have been captured. The FBI has been contacted as well. For the general public, police would like anyone with information to contact the Sacramento County Sheriff’s office.",1

Deloach-Reed headed a department that dealt with the citys deadliest fire in its history, the blaze at a warehouse at 1315 31st Ave. in the citys Fruitvale district on Dec. 2 that killed 36 people who were attending a concert. The property was being used illegally as a residential space and the Fire Department has been criticized for not checking it for safety violations.  According to Schaaf, Deloach-Reed, 59, has lived in Oakland for 22 years but began her fire service career as a firefighter in 1986 with the city of San Jose, where she rose through the ranks before being appointed to the top job in Oakland in 2012. In securing the job, Deloach-Reed became the first African American woman in the country to lead a big city fire department, Schaaf said. Deloach-Reed earned many awards for her leadership, including the NAACP Henry Gage Senior Excellence in Leadership award, the IABPFF Black Chief Officers Committee Metro Lifetime Achievement award and the Martin Luther King Associations Public Safety and Service award, according to Schaaf.

"It was the massacre at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub that made Josh Eisenstat realize that anti-LGBTQ violence can strike close to home, even in “safe spaces.”

“I think a lot of people don’t process that there’s violence that goes on here, every day, against LGBTQ folks in D.C.,” he says. “It’s an issue that doesn’t get a lot of attention, so it’s up to me to raise awareness about that.”

Eisenstat now serves as co-chair of the DC Anti-Violence Project, a volunteer-driven group based out of The DC Center for the LGBT Community aimed at reducing the incidence of and responding to hate crimes and other bias-motivated incidents.

The group also provides therapy and group and individual counseling services for survivors or victims of violent, bias-motivated crimes, free of cost.

DC AVP hosts a quarterly event at Busboys and Poets restaurant, “Taking the Stage, Taking A Stand: LGBTQ Voices Against Violence,” an open mike night where people express their feelings about violence and recovery through song, dance, or spoken word.

Through it, the group hopes to attract new volunteers enthusiastically willing to use their talents on behalf of the larger community.

“We’re looking for people who are outraged at the level of violence that LGBTQ people continue to face in D.C.,” Eisenstat says. “From sexual violence to hate violence, to policies that don’t provide people with their basic needs. We’re looking for anyone who has energy, from those who are good at social media to those already doing anti-violence work who would like to collaborate.”

"Footage of looters and fire burning in Baltimore Monday night sparked some thoughtful comments, and pleas for peace, from some celebrities.  Writer David Simon, who covered the police beat as a newspaper reporter in Baltimore and used that as creative grist for the HBO drama The Wire, blogged about the riots. He chided the rioters who filled the streets on the day of Freddie Grays funeral, even as the Gray family asked for peaceful protest.  Simon wrote, in part, But now — in this moment — the anger and the selfishness and the brutality of those claiming the right to violence in Freddie Grays name needs to cease. There was real power and potential in the peaceful protests that spoke in Mr. Grays name initially, and there was real unity at his homegoing today. But this, now, in the streets, is an affront to that mans memory and a dimunition of the absolute moral lesson that underlies his unnecessary death. If you cant seek redress and demand reform without a brick in your hand, you risk losing this moment for all of us in Baltimore. Turn around. Go home. Please, Simon wrote.

"Social media has recently come under increasing scrutiny for, it is said, reinforcing people’s existing viewpoints in “echo chambers.” Whether it is jihadist terrorism, the Rohingya genocide in Myanmar, or Brexit, Twitter and Facebook are on trial—prompting even the usually reserved Mark Zuckerberg to apologize in person for his company’s missteps in the US Congress and European Parliament. But despite the public outcry, there is surprisingly little hard evidence about the link between social media and real-life outcomes.

In recent research, we look at the role of Twitter’s arguably most prominent user: President Donald Trump. Many commentators have criticized Trump for his inflammatory rhetoric on Twitter, and even cited him as an example of how social media can incite hateful sentiment against minorities. Whether his sharing of anti-Muslim videos or infamous call for a border wall with Mexico, Trump has certainly used Twitter to spread some of his most controversial messages. But are his words also associated with actions outside the online world?

In the paper “Making America Hate Again? Twitter and Hate Crime under Trump,” we investigate the correlation between Trump’s tweets, differences in local Twitter usage, and hate crimes in the US. To start, we document that the overall number of hate crimes since Donald Trump’s presidential election have slightly increased compared to Obama, but are comparable to previous presidencies. At the same time, the months since Trump’s election have been a striking outlier for anti-Muslim hate crime, which has increased substantially.

We also find a tight link between the content of Trump’s Twitter messages in a given week and subsequent real-life events. In particular, the timing of Donald Trump’s tweets about Muslims coincides closely with anti-Muslim hate crimes. Indeed, the Muslim tweets have substantial forecasting power up to three weeks into the future, even after controlling for the general attention paid to Islam-related topics. This is particularly true for hate crimes carried out in areas where many people use Twitter, which we define as counties above the 90th percentile of Twitter users per capita.

At the same time, Trump’s tweets about Muslims are uncorrelated with hate crimes before the start of his presidential campaign. They are also uncorrelated with hate crimes against other minorities—religious, ethnic, racial, or otherwise. This suggests we are not merely picking up weeks of heightened anti-minority sentiment. Although somewhat weaker, we also find evidence that Trump’s tweets about Hispanics are associated with anti-Ethnic hate crimes—but again, only after his campaign kick-off.

The geographical data on Twitter usage across counties reveals another striking pattern. We find that the marked uptick in anti-Muslim hate crimes began with the start of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign in June 2015, and was almost exclusively driven by counties with many Twitter users. The three months with the highest number of anti-Muslim hate crimes since Trump’s presidential run coincided with three important events in Trump’s campaign: (1) his demand for a Muslim travel ban, (2) his endorsement of torturing potential terror suspects in the wake of the Brussel Terror Attacks, and (3) the month of his presidential election. All of these spikes in hate crime occurred in areas with high Twitter usage.

The relationship between Twitter and the shift in anti-Muslim hate crimes since Trump’s presidential run also remains remarkably stable if we take into account differences in voting patterns, ethnic composition, economic conditions, or crime across counties. Indeed, counties with higher Twitter usage were less likely to vote Republican in the last three presidential elections, and in particular for Trump. These counties also show lower levels of poverty among children and the elderly, and a higher share of minorities. We also find no comparable relationship between Twitter usage and other hate crimes since Donald Trump’s presidential run.

A potential concern with these findings might be that counties in which many people use Twitter today may be inherently different in ways that we cannot easily control for. For example, there may be differences in racial bias, persistent attitudes towards particular social groups, or historical experiences that might flare up spontaneously when triggered by political events such as Trump’s candidacy.

So how likely is it that such unobservable factors can explain the disproportionate increase of anti-Muslim hate crimes in counties where many people use Twitter today? We tackle this question by comparing the location of hate crimes under Trump to all previous presidencies since 1990. We find that Trump is a striking outlier: in comparison to all other presidents, hate crimes targeting Muslims have only become concentrated in areas with high Twitter usage under Trump.

In fact, by our preferred measure, anti-Muslim hate crimes were less likely to occur in areas where many people use Twitter today during the Clinton and George W. Bush presidencies. While far from conclusive, these findings make it unlikely that we are merely capturing long-standing factors that have caused the recent flaring up of religious-motivated crimes.

Overall, our findings point towards a potential link between Twitter and hate crime. Of course, we do not claim that Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, or social media itself, is the immediate cause of the increase in anti-Muslim hate crime. Rather, we document that Trump’s presidential campaign marks a caesura for the connection between Twitter usage and hate crimes in the United States. But some related research might make even the most ardent social media optimist rethink.

In a paper on right-wing Facebook users in Germany, we use Internet disruptions and Facebook outages to get closer at a causal effect of social media. What we find is that the correlation between social media posts and violent attacks on refugees vanishes when users are cut off from Facebook. In other research, Ruben Enikolopov, Alexey Makarin, and Maria Petrova have shown that Russia’s dominant social network VK—which gained popularity through its founder’s university classmates—has played a role in the country’s 2011 protest wave.

Our findings are consistent with the idea that Trump’s presidential campaign aided an unraveling of social norms that made people more willing to express views that were previously deemed socially unacceptable—an unraveling that may have prompted a few people to carry out hate crimes. Taken at face value, this means that we need to understand social media if we want to understand how hateful sentiments spread in the 21st century.",1
"Because a butcher at West Village institution Ottomanelli & Sons Meat Market allegedly handed black delivery man Victor Sheppard a noose in April, Sheppard’s former employee has cut ties with the butcher shop. Bronx meat distributor Mosner Family Brands issued a statement announcing it had ended the relationship and condemned the act.

The action comes after Mosner fired Sheppard (which the company claims he “gave up his position for failing to show up to work three times,” and that Mosner is still open to giving Mr. Sheppard his position back, albeit on a different route.) Initially, Mosner offered Sheppard counseling and disability leave, but Sheppard’s lawyer Wylie Stecklow said at the time that Sheppard “could not return to that environment” where Ottomanelli was a customer.

Mosner — which cites NYC restaurants like Keens Steakhouse, ABC Kitchen, Dig Inn, and Hanoi House as customers — maintains it had originally wanted to wait until after the legal fallout to make a decision, but it looks like public opinion rushed the process.

Now, Stecklow calls it “comforting” that Mosner has cut ties with Ottomanelli, but tells Eater, “This was never about his employer. This is about the New York District Attorney’s office expending the appropriate resources to convict Ottomanelli of this hate crime. This is about New York City battling the continuing rise of race-based hatred in our great country.”

Hate crimes involving nooses have been on the rise, with the Times reporting that there has been “a series of reports this year involving nooses — especially in the nation’s capital — that point to the return of the hangman’s rope as a potent expression of racial animus.”

When butcher Joe Ottomanelli reportedly handed Sheppard a noose back in April, he allegedly said, “If you ever have any stress, just put it around your neck and pull it. I could even help you with it.” Ottomanelli did not deny the incident, but called it a joke.

Sheppard has since been receiving counseling separate from Mosner’s offer, and Stecklow says he has not filed or prepared a lawsuit, despite Ottomanelli’s lawyer telling the News, “There’s no reason for this man to quit his job besides the reason that suing is easier than working.”

Ottomanelli has been charged with a hate crime and will appear in court on September 19.",1

"Activist Linda Sarsour has raised more than $80,000 for a Somali woman who claims she was attacked by a white man in a hate crime, but there’s much more to the story, the two people accused of the hate attack tell The Daily Caller.

Sarsour started the fundraiser for Rahma Warsame, a 40-year-old single mother who lives in Columbus, Ohio, who says she was attacked on Saturday night by a white man while defending a friend.

Sarsour, a leader in the pro-Palestine cause who has come under fire for her sympathetic views on sharia law, posted a picture of Warsame in the hospital and said that she has four missing teeth, a swollen face, swollen nose and busted lip.

We must unite against hate. Please support Rahma who was brutally beaten in an alleged hate crime in Columbus, OH. https://t.co/cQ5tnkz5t9 pic.twitter.com/A49Ya1VuUR — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) June 4, 2017

In her fundraising pitch for Warsame, Sarsour says that Warsame will miss work due to her injuries and needs money to provide for her 12-year-old son. The goal for the fundraiser has been increased several times since it was posted on Sunday. The goal is now $100,000.

The Columbus chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has also gotten involved in the case and is calling on police to pursue a hate crime investigation. The group compared the case to an incident in which a white man killed two people who were defending a Muslim woman on a train ride in Portland last month. (RELATED: Linda Sarsour Dismisses Female Genital Mutilation Question Because White Man Asked It)

According to CAIR, Warsame claimed that the white man told her “you all will be shipped back to Africa.” The group held a press conference on Sunday to complain that the man involved in the incident was not arrested.

But Samantha Morales says that the Sarsour and CAIR have the story all wrong, including the allegations that racial epithets were hurled at Warsame.

Morales, 31 and of Mexican heritage, says that she was attacked first by a mob of men and women, including Warsame, following a neighborhood argument involving a woman and her son.

“What happened is not what she is claiming. The woman that is in the hospital, I feel sorry for her, but she is one of the women who was kicking and hitting me after I got tased,” Morales told TheDC in a phone interview on Monday.

Morales, who works as an insurance claims agent, says that her boyfriend, Ricky Boyce, is the man alleged by Sarsour and CAIR to be the white man who hurled racial insults at Warsame.

But both Morales and Boyce say that he uttered no racial pejoratives in Saturday’s incident, which they say began after Morales intervened while a woman of African heritage who lives in her apartment complex was yelling at and hitting her son with a shoe.

“I didn’t even have time to talk to any of them because they were over there jumping [Morales] at the time,” Boyce told TheDC, denying that he made racial remarks during the incident.

Morales says that Sarsour and CAIR have ignored another major piece of the story: Morales herself was transported to the emergency room by ambulance because of the injuries she sustained in Saturday’s melee.

“They’re not even mentioning that I was the victim. They came at me. The woman that’s in the hospital is part of the group that was aggressing me,” Morales said.

A copy of emergency room discharge papers that Morales provided to TheDC show that she underwent a CT scan and X-rays on her hand and ankle at a Columbus hospital. She claims that she sustained a concussion during the attack.

Morales said that the saga began after she yelled from her porch at a woman who was screaming at her child and hitting him with a shoe in a common area behind her apartment.

“I went outside. I wasn’t trying to get involved. I just thought the presence of an adult would have stopped her,” Morales says.

But Morales says the woman — who Morales says she does not know — left for a moment and came back angry and threatened to break the windows on her car and apartment. The woman, who Morales says was carrying a stick, then walked near Morales’ car and accused Morales and Boyce of having taken her child.

Morales says she called 911 and explained what had transpired before the threats.

The standoff escalated to violence soon after, Morales says.

“Four or five different men” assaulted Morales before someone used a taser on her, she claims. Then a group of women joined in the assault, both Morales and Boyce said.

It was after the taser was used that Boyce, who was watching from the apartment, says he sprung into action.

Boyce says he’s sure he hit someone in the scuffle but says he can’t be sure that he struck Warsame. He also strongly denies purposely targeting her.

Morales says that police temporarily detained Boyce but soon let him go. He says that officers realized that he was not an aggressor in the incident.

A police report taken of the incident backs up Morales’ and Boyce’s claims. According to the report, a Muna Warsame had a Taser at the scene of the incident.

The report also states that “due to conflicting statements,” the “primary aggressor was not able to be identified.”

The report also notes that Morales called 911 again on Sunday morning after men and women involved in the events the night before threatened her outside of her apartment.

But in a press release and a press conference held on Sunday, CAIR officials insisted that Columbus police have not thoroughly investigating the case.

“The fact that the perpetrator was not taken into custody and was not charged raises serious concerns and sends a very dangerous message,” Jennifer Nimer, the executive director of CAIR-Columbus and an attorney for Warame, said in a statement. (RELATED: Linda Sarsour Poses For Photo With Ex-Hamas Operative, Has Family Ties To Terror Group)

Nimer did not return a voice mail seeking comment about the information provided by Morales and Boyce.

A group called MY Project USA had planned a rally for Warsame at the state capitol building in Columbus was on Monday, but it was canceled for reasons that are unclear.

For her part, the New York City-based Sarsour has issued several tweets about the Columbus incident. It is unclear if she has talked to Warsame or CAIR or if she is conducting her online fundraiser separately.

She did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent through Twitter.

"Earlier this year, Indian national Srinivas Kuchibhotla was fatally shot in a hate crime, and his murderer was arrested from Missouri.

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People cautions people of color to travel to the Midwestern state at their own risk.

The unusual travel advisory warns people of the legal discrimination in the state citing several unfortunate instances including some from the state authorities as well. In its first travel advisory ever, the organization said that the advisory was issued in June and nationally recognized during its annual convention last week, CNN reported.

“Individuals traveling in the state are advised to travel with extreme CAUTION. Race, gender and color based crimes have a long history in Missouri,” the advisory read. “Missouri, home of Lloyd Gaines, Dredd Scott and the dubious distinction of the Missouri Compromise and one of the last states to loose its slaveholding past, may not be safe.”

ALSO READ: Extremist elements also active in India, US warns citizens in latest travel advisory

The note read that the warning is being issued because of the “sad passage of Senator Gary Romine’s Jim Crow Bill – SB 43 – and recent events throughout Missouri.” The upcoming law will apparently make it difficult for the victims of race discrimination to sue a business.

Citing recent instances of hate crime, the advisory said, “Two internationally born men gunned down outside in Kansas City after their killer thought them to be Muslim.” This perhaps refers to the murder of Srinivas Kuchibhotla, an Indian national, who was shot in a bar in Kansas City on February 22. The murderer Adam Purinton was later arrested by the Missouri police. Purinton was later indicted on hate crime among other charges.

ALSO READ: Who is Srinivas Kuchibhotla?

"A 52-year-old man will likely spend the rest of his life in prison for fatally shooting a bar patron in Kansas and wounding two others after allegedly using racial slurs in a case that has also resulted in federal hate crime charges.

Adam Purinton appears in District Court on March 9, 2017, in Olathe, Kansas. (Tammy Ljungblad /) Tammy Ljungblad / The Kansas City Star via AP file

Johnson County District Court Judge J. Charles Droege sentenced Adam Purinton to life, 50 years without the possibility of parole, on the state charge of premeditated first-degree murder in the death of 32-year-old Srinivas Kuchibhotla, according to the Johnson County District Attorney’s Office. He still faces federal hate crime charges.

Kuchibhotla was an Indian national who worked as an aviation systems engineer and programs manager at GPS maker Garmin.

Purinton also received 165 months on each of two counts of attempted premeditated first-degree murder, the district attorney’s office said in a statement. Purinton pleaded guilty to the three charges in March. All counts are to run consecutive to one another, the district attorney’s office said.

Those charges stemmed from Purinton shooting and wounding Kuchibhotla’s friend Alok Madasani, also from India, and Ian Grillot, who tried to intervene during the shooting at Austins Bar and Grill in Olathe, Kansas, last February.

Purinton is accused of opening fire after using “racial slurs” and yelling “get out of my country,” The AP and Kansas City Star have reported.

Kuchibhotla’s wife, who is from India, did not attend Friday’s sentencing, but issued a statement through a spokesperson.

“Today’s sentencing in the murder of my husband will not bring back my Srinu, but it sends a strong message that hate is never acceptable,” Sunayana Dumala said.

Purinton’s defense attorney on the state charges did not immediately return an email requesting comment.

Dumala also submitted a statement read into the court record in which she described the night of her husband’s murder and the knock at the front door by police that brought her the life-changing news on Feb. 22, 2017.

“They asked me to sit and I just sat on the stairs nearby eagerly waiting to hear about him,” Dumala wrote, according to a copy of the statement provided by her spokesperson. “They asked me my name, Srinu’s name and his DOB. Then they said something which shook me to core and left me breathless. I could not believe what I heard and I prayed that they take their words back, that my husband was alive and not dead.”

Dumala, who met Kuchibhotla while applying to universities in the U.S., described her husband as the love of her life, a true friend, her biggest support system.

They dated for six years, married in October 2012, and moved to Olathe, Kansas, in January 2014, Dumala said.

“We had plans to grow our family and raising kids and were leading normal happy life,” she said. “However, our dreams turned short because of one person.”

Dumala said in the statement that she learned from police the day after the shooting that it was racially motivated.

“In the few minutes that you have seen Srinu you built so much hatred for him that you decided he did not deserve to live,” she said. “What harm did he do to you that you grew so much animosity towards him? He was only enjoying a glass of beer with his friend. I wish you had the ability to see beyond my husband’s skin color and the beautiful and kind-hearted person underneath it.”

Since her husband’s death, Dumala has been active in spreading awareness of hate crimes.

She has launched a social media campaign entitled “Forever Welcome,” with the goal of helping to ensure the U.S. is a safe place for current and future immigrant generations to pursue their dreams. Dumala also organized a peace walk in honor of her husband and participated in a panel on hate crimes.

In January, Dumala attended the State of the Union as a guest of Rep. Kevin Yoder, R-Kan., who helped her with visa issues following her husband’s death.

Purinton, meanwhile, served notice in April about his intent to change his plea on the federal charges, according to the electronic court docket, in a case that carries a possible death sentence.

He is next scheduled to appear in court on the morning of May 21.

One apparent motive in the downtown killings was that Muhammad had learned he was wanted in Williams’ death, Fresno police Chief Jerry Dyer said.

“He made a decision to himself that he was not going to go to jail for shooting a security guard, that he was going to kill as many people as he could (Tuesday), and that’s what he set out to do,” Dyer said.

Police have said they think race was a factor in Tuesday’s shootings, but they haven’t discussed a motive in the guard’s death. What led to that first killing, and what happened in the days afterward, are just some of the mysteries surrounding a case that has stunned the central California city of 500,000.

Shouts of ‘Allahu akbar,’ but racial motive suspected

Police say Muhammad shot three white men he didn’t know on Tuesday morning, firing 16 rounds in 60 to 90 seconds within a block and a half downtown.

Zackary Randalls, a 34-year-old Pacific Gas and Electric Co. employee, was shot dead as he was riding in a vehicle with a colleague, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers said.

Mark Gassett, 37, and David Martin Jackson, 58, were shot near the Catholic Charities social services agency, authorities said.

Muhammad is also accused of firing at a 59-year-old white man coming out of a house, but he missed, the police chief said.

He allegedly pointed the gun at three Hispanic females — a woman, her adult daughter and her 4-year-old granddaughter — who heard the gunshots and got into their car, which then had trouble starting. Muhammad approached on the passenger side and pointed the gun at them but didn’t fire, Dyer said.

Officers found Muhammad running on the street shortly after the last victim was shot. He surrendered to police, telling an officer, “I did it. I shot them,” Dyer told reporters.

“You guys are looking for me,” he also allegedly told them.

Muhammad had posted on social media a dislike for white people and government officials, Dyer said. He also yelled “Allahu Akbar” (God is greatest) when he was arrested, officials said.

Investigators do not know what Muhammad’s religious beliefs are, but it doesn’t appear he targeted anyone based on religion, Dyer said.

“We do not believe … that this is a terrorist-related crime,” Dyer told reporters. “This is solely based on race.”

The FBI is assisting in the investigation.

Muhammad will face four counts of murder — one in the guard’s killing and three in Tuesday’s deaths — and two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, officials said.

Mourning in Fresno

Randalls had just joined PG&E as a customer service representative six weeks ago, said the IBEW 1245 local chapter to which Randalls belonged.

He was joining a colleague for a work-related ride-along when he was shot, the union said.

Randalls leaves his wife of eight years, Katie, a 3-year-old daughter and a 4-year-old son, his friend Jim Light told CNN.

“I don’t even know how his wife is going to broach the subject with the kids (about) daddy’s never (coming) home,” Light said. “How do you explain that to two small children?”

Gassett was shot as he was walking away from Catholic Charities with a bag of food, said his mother, Rosie Wagner. He had “a heart of gold” and had two sons, ages 9 and 13, Wagner said.

“He had two beautiful little boys. He was a good-hearted person, very caring, very loving,” a tearful Wagner told CNN on Wednesday. “Called me all the time, making sure that I was OK.”

Stunned Fresno residents held hands and prayed during a vigil Tuesday.

Maria Praise told CNN she ran inside and locked the doors when she heard the sound of gunfire.

“I could hear the shooting. I saw the man running,” she said.

“My niece saw one victim. She tried to do CPR. But when she touched him, he was already dead.”

Of its slain employee, PG&E said: “Our hearts are very heavy as we have lost a member of our PG&E family.”

Fresno Mayor Lee Brand called it “a sad day for us all.”

“My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims. None of us can imagine what they must be going through.”

Last week’s killing

Muhammad was being sought in what police called the “unprovoked” shooting death of Williams, 25, an unarmed security guard, outside the Fresno Motel 6 on Thursday.

Police haven’t commented on Williams’ race. They had published a photo of Muhammad, asked for the public’s help in finding him and offered a reward.

Muhammad shaved his head and face to change his appearance, Dyer said.

Muhammad’s background

Muhammad had prior run-ins with the law, court records show.

In 2005, he was indicted on charges of cocaine possession with intent to distribute, and possession of two rifles and a semi-automatic handgun.

His public defender raised questions on whether Muhammad was mentally fit to stand trial, noting that on several occasions, he had “appeared eccentric with some bizarre beliefs” and appeared to have hallucinations. The lawyer also said he’d had “at least two prior mental health hospitalizations.”

A psychiatric evaluation found that Muhammad suffered from psychosis and a substantial degree of paranoia. He was declared not competent to stand trial in July 2005.

After an order committing him to a facility in October 2005, he was later found competent for trial in 2006.

Muhammad pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 110 months in prison, which was reduced to 92 months.",1
"WASHINGTON — It was the beginning of the night shift last Wednesday at the United States Mint in Philadelphia, a secure facility that manufactures money, when a white male coin maker strode across the factory floor to the workstation of an African-American colleague. He was carrying a piece of rope.

The rope had an official purpose: to seal coin bags once they were full. But the worker, who operates the machinery used to make coins, instead looped and twisted it into a hangman’s noose, according to Rhonda Sapp, president of the Mint workers’ union. She was soon deluged with calls and text messages from outraged employees.

The episode, which has not previously been reported, was confirmed by a spokeswoman for the Treasury Department with a statement saying that the agency has “absolutely zero tolerance” for such hateful displays and that authorities were investigating.

It is the latest in a series of reports this year involving nooses — especially in the nation’s capital — that point to the return of the hangman’s rope as a potent expression of racial animus.",1

"Another day, yet another hate crime hoax has been exposed.

Remember: every single Hate Crime should be regarded as a hoax until proven otherwise. And its almost always proven to be a hoax. — /pol/ News Network (@polNewsNetwork1) March 23, 2017

Earlier this month, liberal journalist Juan Thompson was arrested for making a series of bomb threats to Jewish schools, centers, and a museum to supposedly intimidate a former girlfriend.

Twitter gets interesting when Sheriff Clarke notices family of murdered DNC staffer is looking for help

And now, just yesterday, after a months-long undercover anti-fraud investigation, Israeli police have arrested a 19-year-old Israeli with dual Israel/American citizenship for allegedly making over 100 bomb threats on U.S. Jewish institutions.

According to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA), Israel’s anti-fraud squad arrested the suspect at his southern Israel home on Thursday. Reports in Israel say the suspect is also accused of making similar threats in the last six months in Australia, Europe, and New Zealand in addition to calling in threats regarding Israeli educational institutions to Israeli Police.

During the arrest, the suspect reportedly tried to take a policewoman’s gun and shoot himself with it.

His motives are as yet unknown, but the suspect’s attorney has raised concerns about his mental status and asked that he be placed under supervision. Ynet has reported that the attorney said the teenager has a brain tumor since the age of 14 that affects his behavior.

According to the Times of Israel, the threats to over 100 Jewish Community Centers and even one to Delta Airlines which led to the emergency landing of a plane, were made using “advanced technology and voice-altering equipment” which were found during the cyber unit’s Thursday raid.

The teen’s father has also been detained on allegations that he knew about his son’s criminal activity.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement: “The Department of Justice is committed to protecting the civil rights of all Americans, and we will not tolerate the targeting of any community in this country on the basis of their religious beliefs. I commend the FBI and Israeli National Police for their outstanding work on this case.”

The FBI was investigating these threats as a hate crime, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center demanded action on “the multipronged threats of anti-Semitism today.” Liberals were even trying to blame President Trump.

"Three people were sentenced today for their roles in two 2004 murders for which the gunman is expected to land on death row. Jose Resendez, 37, and Bernadette Corvera, 32, were both sentenced to 15 years to life behind bars. Both defendants pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and robbery counts -- Resendez for the San Gabriel killing of Dianqui Wu, and Corvera for the shooting death of 22-year-old Pasadena City College student Joseph Molina. Mitzie Ann Oso, 35, who pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in both killings, was given an eight-year term but was expected to be released later today. Shes been jailed since her arrest in 2005 and has already served more days than required by her sentence, according to Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ronald S. Coen. All three defendants negotiated plea deals with prosecutors and testified at the trial of Leonardo Cisneros, who was convicted May 7 of first- degree murder for shooting Molina during a Dec. 10, 2004, heist at a Subway sandwich shop in Whittier, along with the Aug. 4, 2004, shooting death of Wu. The 50-year-old Rowland Heights man was shot, despite agreeing to turn over his money before he was killed in the 1800 block of South Del Mar Avenue. Jurors found true the special circumstance allegations of murder during the course of a robbery and multiple murders, and found Cisneros guilty of 16 counts of robbery and one count of attempted robbery -- some involving armed heists at other businesses in the San Gabriel Valley area. Deputy District Attorney Frank Santoro told the eight-man, four-woman panel that Cisneros was a monster, a ruthless, brutal killer, who deserved a verdict of death because he ruined so many lives. Jurors agreed, and deliberating less than a day and a half before recommending that the 30-year-old defendant be put to death for his crimes. Hes due back in court June 18, when a formal sentencing date is scheduled to be set. A fourth co-defendant, Sara Lopez, 32, pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact in Wus death and was sentenced in 2010 to three years probation. —City News Service",0

"Maddie Goodman, a rising senior at Fox Lane High School in Bedford, has created what she calls a “Community of Kindness” by working with children at Mt. Kisco Child Care Center (MKCCC) and seniors at My Second Home (MSH), through an intergenerational program that she devised that brings them all together. Both organizations are housed in the same building.

Motivated by the desire to bring more awareness to the importance of being kind, Goodman developed the idea of groups building communities based upon kindness and collaboration. “You’re never too young or too old to be reminded of the need to be kind to one another. There’s a lot going on in the world right now that doesn’t feel very kind, so I wanted to bring everyone’s focus back to kindness,” she said.

With her passion for art, Goodman worked with the children at MKCCC, after school in the fall, helping them build houses out of empty milk cartons. She helped the children decorate the milk cartons and created a village as the setting for the houses. Then she asked the children to write kind messages about each other to be displayed on the homes. The children wrote messages such as “good friend,” “nice,” and “kind.”

“As the project developed over the fall, I witnessed the children help each other and engage in several ways. The project was a huge success and we had a lot of fun creating it and talking about how communities prosper with kindness!”

During the past winter, Goodman worked with the seniors across the hallway to help them build a village of their own. In developing the seniors’ village, she had the seniors share memories of their childhood neighborhoods. She incorporated various elements of their lives into the community such as the barber shop one senior lived above while growing up.

Combining the children’s and seniors’ communities made for a wonderful intergenerational program. “When I started working with the children, it was so heart-warming to watch them interact with the seniors across the hallway,” explained Goodman. “ It was like seeing a big family of grandchildren and grandparents all in one area. I wanted to find a way to strengthen the bridge between the two communities and have the foundation be built on kindness toward one another. Kindness is something we can teach our children and we need more of it in the world.”

Learning the concept of Tikkun Olam, Repairing the World, as a member with her family for 15 years at Temple Shaaray Tefila in Bedford Corners, Goodman went forward with her ideas to make an impact on the children and seniors.

And so taken with the My Second Home program, Goodman raised over $500 through family and friends to support the work of the non profit organization.",1

"WILLIAMSPORT, LYCOMING COUNTY (WBRE/WYOU)- The number of hate crimes in the United States has sky rocketed to a point that hasnt been seen in recent years, according to a new statistical report by the FBI.

This comes after more than 1,500 hate crime incidents have been reported to law enforcement agencies across the country.

Its another that should be going down, but the FBI says its not. According to the agency, 6,121 hate crimes were reported in 2016, up from 5,8,50 reports the year before. Observations suggest this follows the large amount of hate and racial speech that has been central in political conversation.

There seems to be sort of a more open attitude of speaking against certain people, said Kris Waldrab, president of the Spectrum Alliance.

I work on Lycoming Colleges campus so Ive noticed that theres been some more antagonistic views, said Jared Richardson, treasurer of the Spectrum Alliance.

The FBI did not give a reason for the increase in hate crimes, but the data gives weight to the argument that some say the 2016 presidential election may have play a role in the stats. In just ten days after the election, the Southern Poverty Law Center found 867 cases of hateful harassment.

Members of the nonprofit group Spectrum Alliance in Central Pennsylvania, which supports the LGBT community, say this issue is a constant work in progress.

I think with our president we are going to go backwards, said Kai Kelly, vice president and founder of Spectrum Alliance. I think it brought courage to a lot of the things that have been kind of put underneath for a while.

While the numbers of hate crimes are going up across the country, fortunately members in Williamsport say theyre thankful they havent seen much hatred in Lycoming County.

I think fortunately we have been pretty well spared in this area and that it just upsets me that the rest of the nation is in such turmoil, says Leatha Kieser of Montoursville.

Founders of Spectrum Alliance say the only way to move forward and have these numbers decrease is to promote inclusiveness in our nation and to accept everyone for who they are.

We just need to understand that people are people, says Richardson.

We can stand up for ourselves but we need allies to stand up, say this is wrong, this is not right, things like that, says Kelly.

According to the FBI report, Americans experienced an average of 250,000 hate crime victimizations each year from 2004 to 2015. A majority of these were not reported to the police.",1
"Nearly 200 attempts to outlaw the practice of lynching have failed on a federal level.

Referring to lynching as an “ultimate expression of racism in the United States following Reconstruction,” the only three black members of the United States Senate have proposed legislation that would make the heinous practice a hate crime. On Friday, Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Kamala Harris (D-CA), and Tim Scott (R-SC) introduced the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act of 2018.

If passed into law, the measure would be the first of nearly 200 attempts to succeed at the federal level. According to The New York Times, Booker acknowledged the significance of recognizing the horrific practice and outlawing it on a national level.

“This sends a very powerful message. Literally thousands of African-Americans were being lynched throughout history, and the Senate never stepped up to pass any legislation to stop this heinous, despicable behavior.”

The practice of lynching Black people, particularly in Southern states, ran rampant with over 4,700 reported cases between 1882 and 1968. According to ABC 7 News, nearly all of those responsible for the heinous crimes escaped prosecution on the state and local level.

In 2005, the U.S. Senate issued an apology for failing to enact legislation which would have made the practice illegal. Harris issued a statement, as reported by The New York Times, calling the gesture “laudable,” but stressed that the apology just wasn’t sufficient.

“The Senate’s apology, while laudable, stills falls short of the mark. It is time for the Senate and the House finally to take up and pass this legislation, and end this stain on American history.”

The proposed measure has facilitated cooperation across political lines. Scott, a Republican and a co-sponsor of the bill, stressed in his statement, which also appeared on Harris’ site, that their unity is necessary to accomplish what many still believe to be a lofty goal.

“This measure is certainly well past due and I am glad to be able to join in efforts that will underscore the severity of this crime,” Scott said. “This piece of legislation sends a message that together, as a nation, we condemn the actions of those that try to divide us with violence and hate.”

The Justice for Victims of Lynching Act of 2018 defines lynching as, “the willful act of murder by a collection of people assembled with the intention of committing an act of violence upon any person.” Passage of the act will ensure that lynching is an added charge on top of murder and other crimes. The penalty for lynching includes life in prison.

Earlier in June, Illinois Congressman Bobby L. Rush and 35 other members of the Congressional Black Caucus introduced a similar measure, H.R. 6086, in the House of Representatives. Rush pointed to the violent Charlottesville protests as an indicator of the deep-seeded racism that still exists.

“While many may argue that lynching has been relegated to history, you only need to look at the events in Charlottesville last year to be reminded that the racist and hateful sentiments that spurred these abhorrent crimes are still prevalent in today’s American society,” Rush said according to The New York Times.",1

"Word On Da Street

SMH…The FBI is investigating whether the stabbing of a visiting black student by a white student at the University of Maryland was a hate crime but the answer to that question seems pretty obvious to us! Check out the details below…

Sean Christopher Urbanski has been charged with first- and second-degree murder as well as first-degree assault in the early Saturday morning attack that killed Richard Collins III, police said.

University of Maryland Police Chief David Mitchell said he asked the FBI to assist in the investigation after learning that Urbanski, 22, belonged to a Facebook group called “Alt-Reich: Nation,” where members post disparaging material about African Americans and others.

“We are here to evaluate that as an ongoing concern with respect to whether or not this was a hate crime,” Gordon Johnson, special agent in charge of the FBI field office in Baltimore, told reporters at a news conference.

No attorney was listed for Urbanski on online court records and a message left at a number listed for his home in Severna Park was not immediately returned Sunday. Collins, 23, who was set to graduate from Bowie State on Tuesday, was visiting friends at the College Park campus when he was stabbed. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army days earlier, Mitchell said.

Officials say Collins was with two friends near a bus stop on campus around 3 a.m. when they heard Urbanski screaming and watched him approach them.

Urbanski said “Step left, step left if you know what’s best for you,” according to the charging documuents. Collins said “no” before Urbanski stabbed him once in the chest, the documents say.

Mitchell, the police chief, said the attack has spread fear across the university.

“If I’m a person of color I would certainly look at this as something that could happen to me. In fact, I know on Facebook our students are saying that,” Mitchell said. – via usnews.com

SMH….These little Neo-Nazi/KKK-type splinter groups have been popping up left and right since you know who got elected and they need to be labeled as the “Terrorist Organizations” that they are. Where are all those people who love calling the Black Lives Matter movement terrorists when real terrorists who happen to be white males do things like this? What’s sad is that Collins was in the military ready to die for a man like the scum who took his life. Since he hates people of color so much, throw this coward in population with some Bloods, Crips, Muslims, Mexican MS-13 gang members, Latin Kings, sprinkle in some Asian gangsters and call it a day. We’ll keep you posted on this case as it develops.

"Life After Hate, run by reformed white nationalists to counter extremism, had its funding halted by the White House months before the Charlottesville rally.

The weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia, was marred with hatred and violence after scores of white supremacists descended upon the city to protest the removal of Confederate General Robert E. Lee’s statue. The protest turned deadly after a white nationalist, identified as 20-year-old James A. Fields Jr., allegedly rammed his car into a group of anti-racism activists, killing a 32-year paralegal named Heather Heyer. Two police officers also lost their lives during the demonstration.

The tragic incident took place mere two months after President Donald Trump, who reluctantly condemned the hate march in Charlottesville after pressure from both sides of the aisle, eliminated the funding for a group combating white nationalism and extremism in the United States.

The Obama administration allocated $400,000 for Life After Hate, a nonprofit run by reformed members of white supremacist and neo-Nazi organizations with an aim to counter hatred, but the Trump administration halted its funding earlier this year in June.

The White House went forward with its decision despite the fact that the organization reported a 20-fold increase in calls for help from those reporting signs of radicalization in themselves or others, according to the Think Progress.

“It sends a message that white extremism does not exist, or is not a priority in our country, when in fact it is a statistically larger and more present terror threat than any by foreign or other domestic actors,” Christian Picciolini, founder of the group Life After Hate and a reformed neo-Nazi, said at the time. “We have hundreds of thousands of homegrown sovereign citizens and militia members with ties to white nationalism training in paramilitary camps across the U.S. and standing armed in front of mosques to intimidate marginalized Americans.”

The former government’s Violent Extremism (CVE) program granted $10 million to 31 organizations, of which Life After Hate was the only anti-white supremacy group. Now, there are only 26 organizations on the list based on their partnership with the law enforcement agencies.

The recent neo-Nazi demonstrations in Virginia, where scores of white nationalists took to the streets proudly chanting slogan of racism and hatred, have reiterated the need for such groups in America.

“I believe that the world has now seen what we have been sweeping under the rug for many, many years — thinking we were in a post-racial society. ... I think that this catalyst shows the world 1. That its a problem, a real problem that exists in our country; 2: that white extremism should be classified as terrorism, and now that we attached the terrorism word to it, it will get more resources. It will be at the top of peoples minds,” he recently told NPR, speaking about the Charlottesville rally. “What people need to understand is that since Sept. 11, more Americans have been killed on U.S. soil by white supremacists than by any other foreign or domestic group combined by a factor of two.”

Picciolini became the leader of a group called the Chicago Area Skinheads when he was 16 years old and relinquished his ties to the white nationalist movement in 1996 when he was 22. After co-founding Life After Hate, he also wrote a book titled “Romantic Violence: Memoirs Of An American Skinhead.”

“As former extremists from the far right, what changed us is when we received compassion from the people we least deserved it from,” Picciolini told HuffPost earlier this year. “Often times they’ve never met a black person or had a meaningful conversation with a Muslim or Jewish person. I get them into a situation where they can sit and talk, and realize there are more things in common than differences.”

"917.

That’s the number of hate groups operating in the US, according to data from the Southern Poverty Law Center. The Alabama-based nonprofit activist group tracks civil rights and hate crimes and defines a hate group as an organization with “beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics.”

“Over the course of a year, we have a team of investigators that scours the internet for racist publications and real world activities to find out which groups exist, which groups are still active and which groups come along,” said Ryan Lenz, a senior investigative reporter for the SPLC’s Hatewatchproject.

Some are classified as anti-LGBT groups, and some are black separatists, who don’t believe in interracial marriage and want a nation only for black people, according to the group.

Some critics of the SPLC say the group’s activism biases how it categorizes certain groups.

But since the FBI doesn’t keep track of domestic hate groups, the SPLC’s tally is the widely accepted one.

"SONOMA COUNTY, CA – A man died while diving Sunday afternoon off the Sonoma County coast, a Cal Fire captain said. Cal Fire responded at 1:53 p.m. to Gerstle Cove in Salt Point State Park where lifeguards pulled a man from the water after a dive. Cal Fire Capt. Robbie Barnes said he believes the man was diving for abalone, which is a common name for a group of small to very large sea snails. The man was pronounced dead on the beach. A helicopter from the Sonoma County Sheriffs Office helped firefighters and state parks personnel lift the victim from the beach. Barnes did not know the mans name or his hometown. A spokesperson for the sheriffs office was not available for comment Sunday night. Multiple Bay Area residents died last year diving for abalone off the coasts of Marin and Mendocino counties. --Bay City News/Photo via Facebook: Sonoma Sheriff",0

"MIAMI, FL — Miami Marlins pitcher Jose Fernandez had cocaine in his system and was intoxicated at the time of his September death. A toxicology report released Saturday indicated the standout pitcher, who attended Tampas Alonso High School, had a blood-alcohol content of nearly twice the legal limit. Fernandez, 24, died in the early morning hours of Sept. 25 when the 32-foot boat he was on crashed into a jetty in Miami Beach. Eduardo Rivero, 25, and Emilio Jesus Macias, 27, also died in the crash that rocked not only the baseball world, but also the Tampa and Miami communities. Saturdays release of the toxicology reports came after a legal dispute erupted involving the Miami-Dade County Medical Examiners Office, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the Miami Herald. See also: Jose Fernandez Remembered as Special Player by High School Coach The county was prepared to release the report earlier but was informed FWC was conducting a criminal investigation into the death. That agency wanted the county to abstain from releasing the autopsy and toxicology reports until its investigation was concluded, a statement from Miami Mayor Carlos A. Gimenez said. The Miami Herald filed a lawsuit against the Miami-Dade Medical Examiner for the release of the report. When FWC wouldnt join the public records suit as a co-defendant, the county opted to release the report, Gimenez said. Because our role in this matter is complete and Fish and Wildlife has the responsibility to prove an active criminal investigation, I have directed the Medical Examiner to fulfill public records request for the autopsy and toxicology reports today, Gimenez said Saturday. See also: Jose Fernandez, Miami Marlins Pitcher, 2 Others Killed in Boating Accident Those reports revealed Fernandezs intoxication. His blood alcohol content was 0.147, which is well above the legal limit of .08, the Herald reported. The reports also indicated that both Rivero and Macias had alcohol in their systems at the time of their deaths, but neither was legally drunk. Rivero also had cocaine in his system, the Herald added. FWCs investigation into the September crash remains active. It remains unclear if Fernandez was driving the boat. He was its owner, however. An affidavit released earlier this week indicated that Fernandez and his two friends had been drinking at the time of the crash. The report indicated the three had a strong odor of alcohol emanating from them. See also: Miami Marlins Pitcher Jose Fernandez and 2 Others Killed in Boating Crash Had Strong Odor of Alcohol According to the affidavit, the three men were at a bar before the crash. A receipt for alcohol purchased at the bar was found in the pocket of one of the occupants. The affidavit does not mention a cause of death, but the associate medical examiner is quoted as saying all three males died with water in their lungs and had blunt trauma consistent with death from a boating collision. Fernandez, a native of Cuba, had strong ties to Tampa. He attended Alonso High School and was a standout member of the Ravens baseball team. News of Fernandezs death rocked the Tampa Bay area and the Alonso High School community. Alonso Highs baseball coach since the school opened in 2001, Landy Faedo, coached Fernandez from 2009 to 2011. Fernandez attended Alonso after he, his mother and sister defected from Cuba after three attempts. When I first saw him, I knew he was special, Faedo told Patch after Fernandezs death. I had no doubt that he was going to be drafted and play pro ball. That prediction came true when he was drafted in the first round by the Miami Marlins in 2011. Fernandez quickly advanced through the minor leagues and made the Opening Day roster in 2013. Fernandez has been described as a pillar of the Miami community. That assessment held true in Tampa, as well, Faedo said. He was a great guy, Faedo said. His teammates gravitated toward him. People just gravitated toward him. He was so full of energy and he lived life to the fullest. With reporting by Amanda Lamela and Feroze Dhanoa Main Image Credit: Arturo Pardavila III via Flickr, Creative Commons",0
"CROWN HEIGHTS -

The torched iconic Mitzvah Bus, pictured Monday morning. (Yaacov Behrman)

Members of Brooklyn’s Orthodox community rallied Tuesday afternoon in support of Lev Scheiber, the owner of the iconic Mitzvah Bus which was torched in the early hours of Monday morning as it was parked in East Flatbush.

The New York Police Department determined that the fire was intentionally set and is investigating it as a hate crime.

“Lev ‘Leviticus’ Scheiber is an artist whose creativity and passion brings a sense of community spirit to our neighborhood,” stated state Sen. Jesse Hamilton, a Democrat representing Crown Heights, in a press release.

“Anyone who would set fire to the Mitzvah Bus, an artwork itself,” Hamilton added, “commits a hateful act against our entire community.”

Nachum Segal, a well-known talk-show host, led a rally against hate on Troy Ave. and Maple Street, where the bus was torched.

The bus, colorfully decorated with splashy paints and Jewish themes, is a familiar sight in the Jewish community. It is seen regularly at local festivals and was featured in singer Benny Friedman’s music video “Ivri Anochi.”

“I found the bus Monday morning completely charred, said Scheiber, also known as Leviticus. “I used the bus as an art studio for Jewish-themed paintings, and to transport my kids to school. We are all devastated.”",1
"Micah Fletcher survived a stab wound to the neck last week when he stood up to an attacker who was harassing two teenage girls on a train in Portland, Oregon.

Two other men, Ricky John Best and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, who also came to the girls’ aid, were stabbed and killed.

Fletcher has said he is still trying to make sense of what happened.

On Wednesday, the 21-year-old got the chance to meet with Destinee Mangum, one of the girls he was injured defending, and her family. Mangum’s mother, Dyjuana Hudson, posted about the experience on Facebook, calling Fletcher an “angel” and a “hero.”

“Finally got a chance to meet one of the angels that saved my daughter’s life,” she wrote. “Micah is one of the best genuine hearted people you will ever meet.”

In an emotional interview, Mangum told Fox affiliate KPTV this weekend that she wanted “to say thank you to the people who put their life on the line for me, because they didn’t even know me.”

“They lost their lives because of me and my friend and the way we looked,” Mangum continued. “I just want to say thank you to them and their family, and I appreciate them, because without them we probably would be dead right now.”

Fletcher was one of three people stabbed after confronting a man on a MAX train for verbally attacking Mangum, 16, and her 17-year-old-friend, who is Muslim and was wearing a hijab. Police arrested Jeremy Christian, who has ties to white supremacist groups, soon afterward.

Fletcher, a student at Portland State University, told USA Today on Tuesday that he’s still “healing” from the May 26 attack. “I got stabbed in the neck on my way to work, randomly, by a stranger I don’t know, for trying to just be a nice person,” he said.

On Wednesday, Fletcher released a video on Facebook thanking supporters for an outpouring of kindness and money, but adding that there’s a problem that needs addressing.

“We need to remember that this is about those little girls,” he said. “I want you to imagine that for a second being a little girl on that MAX. This man is screaming at you. His face is a pile of knives. His body is a gun. Everything about him is cocked, loaded and ready to kill you.”

He noted that there’s a “white savior complex” present in society that has placed all the focus on the three men who stood up to Christian, rather than addressing the daily, lived experience of racism and Islamophobia that young people like Destinee and her friend face.

In a statement during Christian’s court hearing on Tuesday, Fletcher said: “I want the Muslim community to know that they have a home here in Portland and are loved.”",1

Here is why the Attorney General race is so important.

Below is an attack ad Mark Herring has used against the rookie Republican candidate John Adams. Mark Herring has spoken out in defense of a strict definition and prosecution of hate crimes in Virginia.

Below is an attack ad by John Adams against Mark Herring. The important issue that might sway many voters to go for the new Republican candidate is the issue of Pro-Life and Anti-Abortion.

As a young student with a personal connection to this recent victim of possible hate crime I am persuaded to vote for Mark Herring. To me the respect of life should be throughout an entire life and not just for the unborn. Here is what I know about Nabra and why voting to be tough on hate crimes is so important to me;

Worked with her in Mcdonald’s

Talented and hardworker

Always full of happiness

Remained with a smile and laughter

She was so big-hearted

How do we investigate and prevent future crimes? This issue should be discussed and acted upon by our elected officials in Virginia.

"A lawsuit claims that guards at a Colorado prison pepper-sprayed Muslim inmates gathering for a prayer service and later assaulted one of them in retaliation for his plans to pursue the matter in court. The attorney behind the suit calls the actions a hate crime and sees a connection between them and the type of rhetoric that currently emanates from the White House.

When you have a president who is making war on Muslims, this is to be expected, says David Lane, the driving force behind the Lawyers Civil Rights Coalition, a group dedicating to fighting what they see as the Trump agenda. He has now given permission to all of the people who wish to engage in this kind of behavior. And when they embrace that permission, this is the result.

The plaintiffs in the lawsuit are Sterling Correctional Facility inmates Donell Blount, Cecil Mason and Terry Phillips, while the defendants are a trio of corrections officers: Ethan Kellogg, David Scherbarth and Quinlan; the latter staffers first name doesnt appear in the complaint, which is on view below.

According to the suit, Blount regularly oversaw Jumu’ah, a Muslim prayer service, on Fridays from 1 to 3 p.m. But just prior to start time on April 15, 2016, he went to the classroom where the service took place to find Kellogg already there; he was conducting a so-called boot exchange program that allowed inmates to swap out old uniforms or equipment.

A Facebook photo of David Scherbarth. Facebook

The exchange typically took place at a table in the hallway, and the suit says Blount asked Kellogg to use it so the prayer service could go forward as usual.

In response, Kellogg allegedly became upset and hostile and ordered [Blount] to return to his housing unit. Then, at 2:37 p.m., an intercom announcement called Blount and the other worshipers to the classroom. Upon their arrival, the complaint states that the Plaintiffs felt a searing sensation in their noses, throats, eyes and all over their exposed skin. The Plaintiffs realized almost immediately that the room was saturated with OC Gas. The Plaintiffs felt engulfed by the gas and quickly became overwhelmed — especially Blount, who suffers from asthma.

The trio soon fled the classroom, where they reportedly spotted Kellogg laughing at them and otherwise antagonizing the entire group.

Afterward, Blount filed a grievance against Kellogg, and on March 22, 2017, he was called to Scherbarths office to discuss it. When Scherbarth heard that Blount had contacted an attorney, the lawsuit says, the officer threatened him with retribution; the quotes attributed to Scherbarth at the meeting and other officers over the preceding days include Life would be hard, Were gonna have your ass in the hole and They gonna fucking torture you.

A verbal confrontation between Scherbarth and Blount followed, with the inmate subsequently being hauled away by other officers. Among them was Quinlan, who is accused of responding to Blounts refusal to drop the case by delivering several forceful, closed-fist blows to the mid-section of the Plaintiffs torso. Shortly thereafter, the lawsuit maintains, Blount was placed in solitary confinement and denied access to timely medical care, despite the fact that he had blood in his urine for an eighteen-hour period following this assault.

In Lanes view, these incidents go beyond mere abusive treatment on the part of the defendants.

A hate crime is defined as committing a crime when the motivation is someones ethnicity, race, religion, etc., he says. And here we have guards who committed criminal assaults and who were motivated by the victims religion.

The lawsuit is the first the Lawyers Civil Rights Coalition has filed in federal court, and Lane reveals that there will be more to come. We have two lawsuits that are about to be filed, both involving abusive police conduct — and one is clearly based on race.

The reaction to the lawsuit by members of the public reflects Trump-era divisiveness, Lane believes. The readers comments on the Denver Post story are enough to make you lose hope for America, he allows. People who comment about online stories are generally so far to the right its ridiculous. Its a deplorable segment of society.

He adds that the mainstreaming of such responses contributes to the mentality that these guards think they can do that and get away with it — and the reason they feel that way is because they can. But its time to change that mentality.

A broad array of faith and rights organizations joined local Muslim groups Friday in calling for law enforcement to investigate the attack on a Milwaukee Muslim woman as a hate crime.

Munjad Ahmad, a member of the Islamic Society of Milwaukees executive committee, who has met with the woman since the attack, said she is doing better but is shocked and remains in significant physical pain.

On Friday leaders from the Islamic Society of Milwaukee, the Milwaukee Muslim Womens Coalition, Voces de la Frontera, Southeast Asian Educational Development, Ascension Lutheran Church, Jewish Voices for Peace-Milwaukee, the Interfaith Conference of Greater Milwaukee and Milwaukee County Supervisor Jason Haas all condemned the attack against the woman and asked for it to be investigated as a hate crime.

The woman was walking home from morning prayers at the Islamic Society of Milwaukee about 6 a.m. Monday when a car pulled up next to her. A man got out of the car and demanded she remove her hijab. When she refused, the man pulled her to the ground, stomped on her head and slashed her clothing with a knife.

At the news conference Ahmad asked anyone with information on the perpetrator to contact law enforcement.

Milwaukee police have not said whether they are investigating the case as a hate crime. In a statement, the department said officers responded to a battery in the 4800 block of S. 13th St. about 11:30 a.m. Monday. A woman told police she was struck by an unknown suspect several hours earlier near 13th St. and Layton Ave. and police continue to search for the male suspect, according to police.

"The indictment accuses Adam Purinton, 52, of Olathe, of shooting and killing Srinivas Kuchibhotla because of his actual and perceived race, color, religion and national origin.

The man accused of shooting 2 Indian men and one American in an Olathe, Kansas bar in February has been indicted by a federal grand jury on hate crime and firearms charges.

The indictment accuses Adam Purinton, 52, of Olathe, of shooting and killing Srinivas Kuchibhotla because of his actual and perceived race, color, religion and national origin.

The indictment also accuses Purinton of attempting to kill Alok Madasani because of his actual and perceived race, color, religion and national origin, according to the a United States Department of Justice news release.

Purinton was also indicted with violating a federal firearms statue by discharging a firearm in the shootings of Kuchibhotla, Madasani and Ian Grillot.

The indictment alleges that Purinton committed the offenses after substantial planning and premeditation, attempted to kill more than one person in a single criminal episode, and knowingly created a grave risk of death to others on the scene, the news release said.

Purinton faces a maximum penalty of life in prison.

Ian Grillot, 24, tried to stop Purinton before he opened fire at Austins Bar & Grill.

First Grillot said he approached the man as a result of his actions in that restaurant.

I opened the door and was like Im going to have to ask you to leave, sir. Theres no reason to act like that around this bar. This is a family restaurant.

After that, Grillot said the man left and things went back to normal - he went back to watching the University of Kansas basketball game with his friends. But the suspect returned.

I thought all the trouble was over with, and we were all just sitting and watching the game minding our own business.

The bars door opened - and Grillot remembers a man opening up and firing rounds.

I was hit in the hand and the chest. Initially I had gotten him to the table when he first started firing, explained Grillot. I thought I heard nine shots. I thought his magazine was empty. So I got up and started chasing him down. I tried to subdue him so that police could come in and do what they needed to do and I guess I miscounted with everything going on. I got behind him. And he turned around and fired a round at me.

That bullet with through Ians hand and into his chest barely missing his carotid artery and fracturing one of the vertebrae in his neck.

The next thing he remembers is waking up in the hospital.

I was told I was incredibly lucky for what happened to me. I could have never walked again or seen my family again.

Now people are thanking him for his quick action that night.

A lot of people are calling me a hero and this and that and the other - and its not like that. I was just doing what anyone should have done for another human being. Its not about where hes from or his ethnicity. Were all humans. So I just felt I did what was naturally right to do.

Grillot said after waking up at the hospital he was praying for the two other men involved - Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani. Kuchibhotla was killed but Madasani escaped with serious injuries.

Grillots family has started GoFundMe page to help him on his long road to recovery. So far more than $50,000 has been raised to help with his medical bills.

"A 54-year-old Glen Burnie man faces a hate crime charge as police say he threatened an African-American man with a knife and used racial slurs to insult him.

Anne Arundel police said officers responded to a call of a possible assault in the area of Baltimore Annapolis Boulevard and Faywood Avenue in Glen Burnie at 11:23 a.m. Friday.

Police said Mark Rohde, of the 7900 block of Bensch Circle, argued with an unidentified black man and pulled out a pocket knife.

Rohde then threatened the man, police said, and called him “racial slurs.”

The victim was not hurt in the incident, police said, and Rohde was arrested near where the incident allegedly took place.

Rohde faces a charge of harassing/committing a crime upon a person because of race/religion along with related assault charges.

Police spokesman Marc Limansky said the hate crime charge was recommended by the State’s Attorney’s Office after officials had reviewed the facts of the case.

Courts were closed Monday because of the Columbus Day holiday, and a spokeswoman for the prosecutor’s office was not available for comment.

A similar incident allegedly happened on Sept. 3, 2016, when police were called the 7-Eleven at 161 Defense Highway in Annapolis for a report of an assault.

According to a police report, a “thin white male in his late 20’s or early 30’s” threatened a black man with a knife outside the store after an exchange inside. He did not stab the man, police wrote, and as he drove away in his car, he called the man and another woman a racial slur from out of his window.

He was charged with the same hate crime Rohde faces as well as related assault charges. However, prosecutors dropped the hate crime charge as he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault and was sentenced to a a month in jail and three years probation, online court records show.

The man’s mother told investigators her son was homeless and possibly suffering from schizophrenia, according to the police report.

The charge is also the same two Crofton men were charged with after police said cameras captured video of them hanging a noose from Crofton Middle School in May.

Conner Prout, 19, pleaded guilty to the charge and the State’s Attorney’s Office worked a deal with the NAACP that saw Prout avoid prison in favor of probation with community service supervised and dictated by the group.

The second man, John Haverman, 19, is set to go to trial on Oct. 19, according to online court records.

Rohde could not be reached for comment and no attorney was listed as representing him in online court records.

"LOS ANGELES, CA — Two weeks after the LAPDs first-ever use of a sniper in a helicopter to shoot a suspect, the Board of Police Commissioners was briefed Tuesday on the criteria the department uses for implementing the tactic. LAPD Assistant Chief Beatrice Girmala, director of the Office of Special Operations, said the department first developed the ability to use SWAT snipers from a helicopter in 2004 and had come close to using it four times since 2012. But until May 8, the helicopters never left the ground. Specific criteria is needed for the LAPD to consider using the aerial platform, Girmala said, and there is a multi-layered command and control process implemented when the department makes the decision to use it. A SWAT sniper shot and killed burglary suspect Anthony Soderberg, 29, of Shadow Hills near the 11300 block of Alethea Drive after a standoff with LAPD officers. Police said Soderberg barricaded himself inside a home and shot at officers before being flushed out with tear gas and fleeing out the back of the residence, where he tumbled down a ravine before being shot. RELATED: LAPD Sniper Kills Suspect From Helicopter, A First In Department History Beck told the Los Angeles Times that the house was at the top of a hill, surrounded by brush and debris, which created a very difficult location for SWAT officers, contributing to the decision to bring in the officers trained to fire from a helicopter. The suspect definitely had high ground at all of the ground officers, was firing indiscriminately at them and actually fired at the helicopter, we believe, Beck said. According to Girmalas report, which the commissioners requested after the helicopter shooting, factors considered by the LAPD include if there is a crime of violence; if the incident presents extraordinary and challenging circumstances above and beyond what would normally be dealt with; and if the suspect is using an elevated platform, a challenging venue, or terrain to his or her advantage over officers, making traditional approaches by ground unsafe. Girmala also said the department would consider using the aerial platform on a suspect in a vehicle if weapons of mass destruction, explosives or superior weaponry was involved. The department also has a multi-layered approach to command and control when using the aerial platform, Girmala said, as the commanding officers of the Air Support Division, Metropolitan Division and Counter-Terrorism and Special Operations Bureau must all sign off on its use, as well as the incident commander on the ground. Girmala stressed that using the aerial platform is not pre-approved deadly force, and that the same policy on lethal force applies. City News Service; Photo by Mfield via Wikimedia Commons.",0
"NEW LONDON, CT - New London police said they arrested a Norwich woman charged with stabbing a person in the face with a pen during a fight at a nail salon Tuesday. Police responded Tuesday to Lucky Nails Salon around noon to investigate reports of a potential fight and stabbing taking place, according to a release. Officers found the involved suspects were already separated, and one participant was bleeding from the right side of his face. Further investigation revealed the suspects knew each other and were employed at the salon. The incident was the result of some business disagreements within the salon.

The suspect then stabbed the victim in the face with a ballpoint pen. Nguyen was charged with assault in the second degree and Breach of Peace.

"In this week’s report: A big spike in anti-Muslim hate crimes for our neighbor to the north, a congressman is shot in Virginia by a leftist hater and a federal hate crime charge for the Kansas shooter.

It’s not just the United States that is seeing an uptick in hate crimes. Our neighbor to the north saw a 253 percent increase in hate crimes against Muslims from 2012 to 2015, newly released government stats show. It’s a trend that continued through 2016 and into this year, according to the National Council of Canadian Muslims, which is collecting its own statistics.

“I believe we’re already way outpacing the data that we have from 2016 and therefore 2015,” the council’s communications director, Amira Elghawaby, told GlobalNews.

Canada was the scene of one of the worst anti-Muslim mass killings in North American history earlier this year. On Jan. 29, 27-year-old Alexandre Bissonnette walked into an Islamic center in Quebec and shot indiscriminately into a crowd of worshippers. He killed six men and injured several more.

Islamophobia has been a big political issue in Canada this year. In March, the Canadian government overwhelmingly passed a motion calling on the government to “condemn Islamophobia and all forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination.” The motion, which was introduced by liberal Muslim lawmaker Iqra Khalid, also calls on the government to study and better document hate crimes in Canada.

The action by Canada’s parliament unleashed a torrent of anti-Muslim hatred. Khalid reportedly received 50,000 emails about the motion, many of which she said were direct threats. Commentator Sabreena Ghaffar-Siddiqui wrote in the National Observer:

Given the alarming rise in attacks against Muslims, it appears that Muslims are being singled out. Hate crimes have decreased overall, yet hate crimes against the Muslim community have doubled. One in four Muslims reports having encountered difficulties crossing borders. And Muslim youth are the least optimistic about the next generation facing less discrimination than them.

The rise in anti-Muslim hate in Canada comes on the back of a similar spike in the U.S. As we reported in a Hate Report last month, anti-Muslim hate crimes spiked 57 percent in 2016 according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations.

Just as a heated presidential campaign in the U.S. has been blamed for inflaming anti-Muslim rhetoric here, politics is also being blamed for Canada’s spike in anti-Muslim hate crimes.

Virginia shooter ranted against the GOP

James T. Hodgkinson, who police say opened fire Wednesday morning at a baseball game stocked with Republican lawmakers and staffers, has a long history of arrests, domestic abuse and hatred of the GOP.

As The Washington Post reported, Hodgkinson wrote two dozen letters to his local newspaper from 2008 to 2013 ranting about the right wing and the Republican Party. From one 2011 letter:

There’s a new version of what GOP stands for. It’s not the Grand Old Party anymore. It’s the Greedy One Percenters. I wish everyone could see how by changing the tax code, more than 95 percent of this country’s problems could be solved,” he added. “We need to vote all Republicans out of office.”

Hodgkinson, a 66-year-old Illinois resident, allegedly shot five people at the game, including the House Majority Whip Steve Scalise. He was then killed in a firefight with police. A friend of his told the Post that he had met Hodgkinson on the campaign trail for Bernie Sanders.

Investigators are looking at whether Hodgkinson “had long planned Wednesday’s assault and possibly studied the movements of lawmakers in the months he spent living in his van in Northern Virginia,” according to the Post.

Mark Pitcavage, a senior research fellow at the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, told me he’s worried about growing political violence:

This could be an isolated incident, not indicative of any larger problem in American society. One act does not a trend make. But I am concerned that, in this highly polarized and divided society, more people who have stances that fall within the mainstream, on the left and right alike, may consider political violence an attractive option. Should this occur, we will all suffer for it.

An epic trolling in Texas

Because everything is bigger there, Texas was home to this huge farce, when hundreds of people showed up to protect a Confederate-era monument that actually wasn’t under attack.

It all started on Facebook. According to the Daily Beast, back on May 18, a group calling itself “Texas Antifa” posted that hundreds of leftist anti-fascist activists would be holding a protest on June 10 at the statue of Sam Houston, a Confederate-era politician and slaveowner. The post goaded monument supporters, challenging them to show up and face off.

“The Fascists better not show up with violence or they will be limping home bruised, broken, hurt, and crying with their tails tucked between their legs,” the post read.

But the whole thing was a ruse. On Saturday, hundreds of far-right protesters showed up to defend the monument, many of them armed with guns. The only problem was there were few leftists there to square off against. It turns out “Texas Antifa” isn’t even a real group. It was just made up for the purposes of tricking the far right, and there never was an organized effort to protest at the monument.

Not that these protests haven’t happened. We’ve covered the controversy surrounding the removal of Confederate-era statues across the country in recent Hate Reports. Last month, for example, noted white supremacist Richard Spencer led a procession of citronella torch-wielding protesters to surround a monument threatened with removal in Charlottesville, Virginia.

And the event in Houston wasn’t all fun and games. In a video circulating online, a young far-right protester was choked by a man wearing fatigues. Surrounded by gun-toting, seemingly anti-fascist vigilantes, the man can be seen holding up posters depicting popular far-right memes and shouting, “what about the memes” before one of the militia put him in a headlock.

“What about the memes” has now … become a meme.

What a time to be alive.

‘Anti-sharia’ protests meet anti-anti-sharia protests

As we noted in last week’s Hate Report, the Islamophobic organization ACT for America organized 20 or so “anti-sharia” rallies across the country last weekend. The protests were billed by the group as an American response to radical Islam, and “in support of basic human rights for all.”

There were arrests as the protests got violent in Seattle and St. Paul, Minnesota. There was a lot of shouting between the two sides but most of the protests ended peacefully.

Kansas shooter charged with federal hate crime

Adam Purinton, the man who allegedly shot three men, killing an Indian immigrant in an attack at a bar in suburban Kansas earlier this year, was charged with a federal hate crime late last week.

The charges are significant because Kansas has a comparatively weak state hate crime law. While the state has a hate crime provision that allows a judge to hand down a more stringent sentence, the law doesn’t require the judge to do so.

Under the federal hate crime statute, Purinton could face the death penalty for the attack, although the Justice Department hasn’t yet said if it will pursue the death penalty in the case.

"August 18, 2017 (Washington, DC) – Almost one week ago, Heather Heyer lost her life and several others were injured when a white supremacist drove a car through a crowd of people protesting against a racist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Terre Haute - An ugly incident continues to unfold at Indiana State University. Freshman, Mckinsey Glover believes one of her floor mates in Mills Hall targeted her with a hate crime.



I was very surprised. You hear about it but when it actually happens to you, youre like, woah this is real, said Glover.



Glover posted the evidence to Facebook.

Someone taped hair and a sanitary pad to her door outside of her room, they also left a hateful message on her white board, black lives dont matter.

Glover says another African-American girl on her floor had the same message written on her white board in august.



I dont think that we should have to fight. I dont think we should have to argue because we look this way or we sound this way or we are doing this or we are doing that. But, I also dont think that it is fair, or its right, said Glover.

She believes the incident stems from an argument she had with another dorm resident.

The students met with ISU officials, where glover says that she learned that the alleged perpetrator is now under investigation.

According to Glover, officials told her they are leaving the hair and pad out of the discussion and focusing on the hateful speech.

Despite this experience, glover is not running away, I am still going here I am not leaving. They have me for the next four years.

One of her peers heard what happened and felt compelled to speak out.

Jarel Shaw is an author, public speaker, and dancer amongst many more things.

He used these three talents to spread the message of awareness and to encourage his peers to embrace individuality.



Her experience, of course, it matters, it is happening now. This isnt something that you can just brush under the rug. This happens probably every day we just dont know about it or it just came out now. This isnt something that is new. We need to continue to be aware of this, said Shaw, Freshman.

Glover says that more than anything she wants things to go back to normal on her dorm floor and to send a message to the public about stereotyping race.

I just want everyone to know that everyone isnt like this at all. All whites arent like this, all blacks, all whatever you are. I just want them to know that, dont hate this race because they did that, she said.

Glover says that the best thing to do when facing these kinds of situations is to report the problem to authorities and give the process time to unfold.

She says if that doesnt work then you can decide the most effective way to non-violently spread your message.

For her, it was Facebook.",1
"An Upper Township man has been sentenced to 17 years in prison for his role in a large scale narcotics ring in Cape May County, Prosecutor Robert L. Taylor announced on Friday. Javier Alicia-Garcia previously pleaded guilty to being the leader of the ring busted as part of Operation Dreamchaser last year, Taylor said. The Ocean City Police Department participated in that investigation, which began in January of 2015. He had been indicted on first-degree charges of leading a narcotics trafficking network as part of the bust, which included the indictment of 15 total people and the seizure of over 20,000 bags of heroin worth over $305,000 dollars; approximately four ounces of cocaine worth about $5,600; $348,903 in Unites States currency; 10 firearms, three of which were handguns; 25 vehicles; and two residential properties.

"More than 10,000 men and women continue the firefight against a half-dozen large blazes in California, as this years seemingly nonstop fire season continues. There are a total of six major incidents in the state as of Monday, and Cal Fire officials say that near normal temperatures helped them gain ground over the weekend on many of them — as well as some smaller, new weekend fires. Together, these fire have burned an estimated 737 structures and tens of thousands of acres of brush as of Monday morning, according to the most recent Cal Fire estimates. Meanwhile, the so-called Chimney Fire continues to inch closer to the famed Hearst Castle, an historic mansion originally owned by newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst.

"A series of documents obtained by The Round Table have revealed the physical evidence that lead to the recent arrest of Michael Tyler Kee’19 for an incident involving Islamophobic graffiti on the Beloit College campus.

In an affidavit submitted by Detective Amber Davies of the Beloit Police Department, it is reported that Officer Aaron Mueller of the Beloit PD responded to the initial vandalism complaint around 2:30 a.m. on the morning of Monday, Jan. 30, where he found the Islamophobic graffiti. Mueller also discovered “a used can of red spray paint in a garbage can that was located in close proximity” to Kee’s door.

The affidavit goes on to state that when Officer Rick Valdez, an evidence technician, arrived on the scene, he discovered that Kee had “admitted to having bought the can of red spray paint” from Walmart at 11:30 p.m. on Sunday, Jan. 29. According to Valdez, “Kee reported that [they] threw the spray paint out in the garbage because [they] found that it was for wood and not what [they] intended to use it for.”

Then, on Tuesday, Jan. 31, at approximately 4:30 p.m., the Beloit PD report that Kee “admitted to purchasing the spray paint at Walmart in the City of Beloit and used the spray paint to write the racial slur on [their] own apartment door.”

Kee was arrested and has been tentatively charged with obstruction, disorderly conduct and criminal damage.

When escorting Kee back to their room, officers also discovered “red colored, overspray looking, spray paint on the carpet inside Kee’s apartment.”

The search warrant, which was authorized by Rock County Court Commissioner Stephen D. Meyer on Feb. 1, resulted in a piece of the carpet and a slip of paper being confiscated. The contents of the paper are unknown at this time.",1

The Southern Poverty Law Center documented more than 1,000 hate incidents and hate crimes during 10 days in early November following the presidential election. The hate continues and, in fact, seems to be escalating worldwide.

To examine and promote understanding of this climate, Community Word and Bradley University’s Department of Sociology & Social Work, African American Studies Committee and Intellectual & Cultural Activities Committee are co-sponsoring a free public forum with Lecia Brooks, outreach director at Southern Poverty Law Center, to discuss the rise in hate groups and hate crime. Lecia Brooks will discuss what people can do to combat hate.

The event takes place at 7 p.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 29 at the Bob Michel Student Center at Bradley University, Peoria, IL.

A panel of four members of the Peoria community will be part of this public forum. Panel members include:

Rev. Marvin Hightower, Peoria Chapter NAACP

Imam Kamil Mufti, Islamic Foundation of Peoria

Rebecca Carlson, Jewish Federation of Peoria

Sonny Garcia, Illinois People’s Action

Moderator is Garry Moore

“The swastika has reappeared in ways we have not seen before,” Brooks said, noting that teachers in kindergarten through grade 12 have reported they have never seen such a sharp rise in expressions and acts of hate. Children are repeating rhetoric from the campaign and using it as racial slurs. Southern Poverty Law Center has tallied hate crimes and found most were committed against immigrants, followed by Black, Muslim and LGBT groups. The swastika was the next leading hate category and is used as an expression of anti-Semitism and as a symbol of white supremacy.

Southern Poverty Law Center has identified 917 hate groups in the United States. There are groups in Bloomington, Canton, Springfield, Rockford and outside of Peoria.

The event is free and open to the public. News media coverage is encouraged.

SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER is a nonprofit founded in 1971 to fulfill the promises of the civil rights movement and apply America’s founding democratic principles to all people. Priorities include: combating hate, teaching tolerance, protecting the rights of children; seeking justice, immigrant justice, LGBT rights and criminal justice reform.

Lecia Brooks leads the Southern Poverty Law Center’s outreach efforts on key initiatives and social justice issues. As outreach director, she frequently gives presentations around the country to promote tolerance and diversity. She also serves as director of the Civil Rights Memorial Center in Montgomery, Ala., an interpretive center designed to provide visitors to the Civil Rights Memorial with a deeper understanding of the civil rights movement. She joined the SPLC staff in 2004 as director of Mix It Up at Lunch Day, a Teaching Tolerance program designed to help break down racial, cultural and social barriers in schools. Previously, she worked for 12 years in a number of capacities for the National Conference for Community and Justice in its Los Angeles office. She is a graduate of Loyola Marymount University.",1
"Frisco Men Face Up to Life in Prison for Hate Crimes. Nigel Garrett and Cameron Ajiduah pleaded guilty to using the dating app Grindr to target and assault gay men in a series of home invasions earlier this year. They could get up to life in prison and a $250,000 fine. “The Justice Department will not tolerate hate crimes against any individual based on sexual orientation. Hate crimes are violent crimes but also attack the fundamental principles of the United States,” Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore said.

Capital Murder Conviction Reversed, Court Says Evidence Withheld. Dallas man Jerome Deamus was convicted of capital murder for allegedly killing two brothers at a nightclub in 2013. He was sentenced to life in prison in 2015 without parole. Now, the 5th Court of Appeals in Dallas discovered that a prosecutor didn’t turn over two eyewitness statements to the defense and withheld other evidence that would undermine an eyewitness. The judge found the evidence to be insufficient for capital murder, so Deamus will have a new trial in Dallas County.

"The owner of a cannabis testing facility in Oregon claims she is the victim of an anti-white “hate crime” after she was pressured to resign from her position as CEO due to reports by local antifa activists that she is associated with neo-Nazis.

The Oregonian/OregonLive reports OG Analytical owner and CEO Bethany Sherman was accused by Eugene Antifa members of providing food for “neo-Nazi gatherings” and running a Twitter account that references a white supremacist slogan. Sherman’s partner, Matthew Combs, was also accused of being an organizer for a white supremacist group.

While the Oregonian/OregonLive did not receive a response by text when they asked Sherman if she ran that particular Twitter account, Sherman issued a statement claiming she is the victim of an anti-white hate crime for committing a “thought crime”:

[…] I would like to address these claims head-on. I am not, nor have I ever been, a Neo-Nazi or affiliated with any Neo-Nazi group or any other extremist organization. The accusations made against me and my family are very upsetting to me, and I want to make it clear that this is not who we are. The contents of this article are very twisted in their portrayal of events. My only crime is a thought crime, akin to 1984. I believe that the world is tapestry of beautiful colors, each one full of a wealth of cultural heritage, and that each culture has a right to be proud of their heritage, and an obligation to protect and preserve that culture. I believe that this tapestry is not exclusive of European Americans, and I find it extremely disconcerting that it is admired and revered to have Gay Pride, Black Pride, Asian Pride, or pride in any other cultural heritage, but if you have White Pride, it automatically makes you a Nazi, and you are ostracized, attacked, and lynched by your community. […] I am a human being, just like you, and Ive worked very hard to give back and to create a safe and accessible industry for ALL Oregonians. I am the victim of a hate crime, perpetrated by an anonymous organization whose primary aim is to ruin other peoples lives.

Despite Sherman claiming that the attacks against her constitute a hate crime and hold no bearing, she announced in her statement to the Oregonian/OregonLive that she is resigning from her position at OG Analytical and is putting the business up for sale.

Sherman told Leafly, a marijuana-related publication, that the Oregonian/OregonLive story has trumped up publicity for her business and led to offers.

OG Analytics lab director Rodger Voelker, however, told the Oregonian/OregonLive that “The brand is dead.”

"Keeping with an earlier promise—and surprising the LGBTQ community— Attorney General Jeff Sessions will carry out legal proceedings against people who target transgender Americans. A Justice Department civil rights attorney will prosecute a man who allegedly shot and killed a Black genderfluid teen in Burlington, Iowa during 2016.

Kedarie/Kandicee Johnson was 16 years old when they were killed on March 2, 2016. After a lengthy police investigation, 22-year-old Jorge “Lumni” Sanders-Galvez was charged with murdering Johnson in the first degree. Des Moines County Attorney Amy K. Beavers has since announced the federal government is looking into the case to see if it is a federal hate crime, as Johnson’s mother previously argued that her child’s death was based on their gender identity, according to the Advocate.

“The federal authorities are investigating the case as a federal hate crime, and so they would like to be part of the state case for seamless prosecution, should an indictment in federal court be handed down,” Beavers said, the Des Moines Register reports.

Attorney Christopher J. Perras, an expert in federal hate crimes, was “personally” sent to Iowa by Sessions himself on Friday, the New York Times reports. Justice Department lawyers are rarely dispatched to local areas to carry out criminal prosecutions except when the government believes a case is particularly important for the nation, which means Sanders-Galvez’s sentencing may impact federal policies on federal hate crimes against transgender gender-nonconforming citizens in the near future.

Sessions previously vowed to prosecute hate crimes against transgender individuals over the summer, shocking the LGBTQ community. After all, Sessions voted against protecting American citizens under gender identity hate crime legislation in the past, which means the attorney general is executing a law that he disagreed with in the Justice Department.

“We have and will continue to enforce hate crime laws aggressively and appropriately where transgendered [sic] individuals are victims,” Sessions said back in June. “I personally met with the department’s senior leadership and the civil rights division to discuss a spate of murders—a number of murders around the country of transgendered [sic] individuals.”

Activists remain skeptical, however. Sessions has repeatedly criticized the LGBTQ movement, and his Justice Department has defended employers who discriminate against their queer employees multiple times in the past. He’s even praised anti-LGBTQ groups, comparing their “religious freedom” agenda to Martin Luther King Jr.’s struggle for racial equality. Many LGBTQ activists believe Sessions’ attitude toward the community hasn’t changed at all, and that he’s just doing his job to carry out federal hate crime prosecutions.

“He has no problem with discrimination against LGBTQ people in jobs, education, and other facets of life, but will lean forward in this one case where a transgender individual has been killed,” former Obama administration civil rights division head Vanita Gupta said to the Times. “While it is, of course, good that DOJ is aggressively pursuing this case, it would behoove Sessions to connect the dots between his policies that promote discrimination and hate that can result in death.”

This is DISGUSTING. No one in @realDonaldTrumps admin has done more harm to queer people than Jeff Sessions. No one. — Lambda Legal (@LambdaLegal) October 15, 2017

LGBTQ rights nonprofit Lambda Legal has since condemned Sessions, arguing Sessions feigns interest in civil rights issues to mask his disdain for them.

“For Sessions now to seek credit for helping prosecute hate crimes against transgender people is akin to him handing out gasoline and matches and then looking for a pat on the back when he prosecutes someone for committing arson,” Lambda director of strategy Sharon McGowan said on Sunday.

"When scholars noted in the spring that reports of hate crime were up 12.5 percent in Americas largest metropolitan areas, the Dallas area stood out in a bad way. In North Texas, reports of such crimes to law enforcement agencies had jumped 27 percent in 2017 from the year before.

When the Anti-Defamation League announced last week that propaganda by white supremacists surged on college campuses during this past school year, too, Texas was in the headlines again. Of the 292 incidents tracked by the ADL, 67 took place in Texas, more than anywhere else.

What are hate crimes? They can be violent and deadly. And they can be harassment or intimidation. What they have in common is that they target their victims based on race, religion, ethnicity or sexuality. Its the motivation behind them that makes them hate crimes.",1
"Adam W. Purinton, a Navy veteran, who fatally shot and killed Indian software engineer Srinivas Kuchibhotla last year, has been sentenced by to life in prison after he was convicted in March of premeditated first-degree murder.

Purinton, 52, will spend the rest of his life in prison, if he is spared of death penalty on hate crime charges, which is pending with federal authorities.

The case file says Purinton asked Kuchibhotla and his colleague Alok Madasani their visa status before shooting them.

Kuchibhotla, who is from Hyderabad, was working on H-1B visa as an aviation programs engineer at the Kansas-based technology company Garmin International.

According to Madasani, who survived the shooting, said Purinton, after an altercation with the two Indians, came back and shot them. A third patron, Ian Grillot, was also wounded as he tried to intervene. Eye-witnesses said Purinton yelled, “Get out of my country!” before opening fire.

According to the court documents, Purinton, after shooting the three, fled the scene in his car and drove 70 miles before stopping at a restaurant in the neighboring Missouri, where he confessed the crime to a bartender.

The state of Kansas has recognized March 16, 2017 as “Indian American Appreciation Day” to honor Kuchibhotla.

Sunayana Dumala, the wife of Kuchibhotla, almost got deported as her legal status to live in the country expired after her husband’s death because she was on his dependent visa.

Dumala earlier this year attended President Donald Trump’s first State of Union address as a guest of Rep. Kevin Yoder, R-Kansas, where she said that she has seen “The Worst and Best of America.”

She has created a community organization named “Forever Welcome” with the help of the Intouch Solutions. where she works to show empathy and understanding for people who are immigrants in the United States by bringing their personal journey and contributions to light.

Kuchibhotla completed his bachelor’s degree from the Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University in Hyderabad in electrical and electronics engineering in 2005. He earned a master’s degree from the University of Texas El Paso in 2007. At UT, he worked as a teaching assistant and later as a research assistant.

Purinton, according to Justice Department, engaged in the violent act primarily because of the race, color, religion and national origin of his victims.

According to the statement off Austin’s Bar and Grill employees, Purinton, a regular customer, became an alcoholic after the death of his father, which had affected him physically and mentally for two years.

"Tonya Harvey, a trans woman from Buffalo, NY, has just become the third trans person (and the second of color) to be killed in 2018, following 42-year-old Christa Leigh Steele-Knudslien from Massachusetts, and Vicky Gutierrez from Los Angeles, CA. Now, the Erie County District Attorney’s office is looking into the killing as a hate crime.

The killing was first reported earlier this week, but while the police initially misgendered Harvey, The Buffalo News correctly identified her in a new report yesterday. As reported by The Huffington Post, a spokesperson for the D.A.’s office said:

“The Erie County District Attorney’s Office, along with Buffalo Police, is investigating the death of a transgender woman killed on Shepard Street. The DA’s Office is also extremely concerned about a spike in homicides of transgender people across the country and will be, as part of this investigation, looking into whether or not this is a potential hate crime.”

Police reports indicate that Harvey was shot on Shepard Street just before 5:30PM on Tuesday, and was declared dead at the scene. Not only was this the third instance of a trans person getting killed in the U.S, but it was also Buffalo’s first homicide of the year.

I need to repeat a fact: Tonya Harvey is the third reported killing of a trans person (who knows how many go unreported) in less than two months. Three people from our country’s smallest demographic in less than two months is huge. Last year, GLAAD reported at least twenty-six trans people murdered, most of them people of color.

People who love to argue against equal rights for trans people love to talk about safety, about how people aren’t safe around trans people somehow. However, in that equation, it is clearly cis people who have zero need to worry about their “safety.” Not when it’s trans people getting murdered in these numbers.

Say Tonya Harvey’s name. And then go out there and fight.

“They are scared,” the lawmakers wrote to Sessions, “and it is incumbent upon you as our nation’s chief law enforcement officer to demonstrate to them and all Americans that discrimination and violence against any individual because of who they are, how they worship, or who they love will not be tolerated in our country.”

The lawmakers requested that Sessions prioritize funding for the Community Relations Service and Civil Rights Division. They said the Justice Department needs to reaffirm its commitment to work with state and local officials in prosecuting hate crimes.

The letter comes after a recent uptick in anti-Semitic incidents. Many Jewish community centers have received bomb threats since the beginning of the year.

"The vandal broke windows, slashed tires and spray painted Nazi swastikas and racial slurs that read Go Home, Musslim (sic) Terrorist and Trump America.

Authorities want the publics help in finding the person who spray-painted words such as Go Home, Trump America and (Muslim) terrorist on a vehicle in Ohio.

Somebody damaged and vandalized a Ford Explorer owned by a person of Middle Eastern descent at about 4:20 a.m. on May 4, 2017, Cincinnati FBI officials recently announced.

The vandal broke windows, slashed tires and spray painted Nazi swastikas and racial slurs that read Go Home, Musslim (sic) Terrorist and Trump America.

Executive Assistant Police Chief Dave Bailey said hate crimes are rare in Cincinnati, but they can cause fear for victims and have ripple effects in the community.

Hate crimes are not only an attack on the victim, Byers said. Theyre meant to threaten and intimidate an entire community.

Paul Booth with the Human Relations Commission said these rare crimes seem to be happening more.

Im appalled and uh there seems to be an increase although we cant quantify that, he said.

His office is currently working on tracking these crimes, but in the meantime he said the community also has to do more.

We have to say this is no place for hate. We have to lock arms. We have to stand together as a community and when we see something we must say something, Booth said.

The FBI asks anyone with information to call the FBI in Cincinnati. A $3,000 reward is offered for information leading to an arrest.

On May 4, 2017, at approximately 4:20 a.m., a 2006 Ford Explorer in an apt building parking lot in the Sayler Park neighborhood of Cincinnati, OH, was badly damaged and vandalized with graffiti.

“We urge anyone with information that could lead to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrator to immediately contact law enforcement authorities,” said CAIR-Cincinnati Executive Director Karen Dabdoub. “We thank the FBI for its action in this case and hope it sends a strong message that acts of anti-Muslim bigotry will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.”

According to Council on American Islamic Relations, America’s largest Muslim civil liberties and advocacy organization, anti-Muslim hate crimes have been on a rise since Donald Trump was elected the president of the country.

"A former reserve sheriff’s deputy is facing hate crime charges after telling Louisiana authorities that he plowed his pickup truck into a convenience store because he thought its Sikh owners were Muslim.

Chad Horsley, 27, was arrested Monday andcharged with one count each of hate crimes, simple criminal damage to property, and criminal mischief, and two counts of false impersonation of a peace officer. He was later released on $56,000 bond, the Baton Rouge Advocate newspaper reports.

The store Horsley allegedly targeted in Livingston Parish, Louisiana, is owned not by Muslims, but by Sikhs, who are often thetargets of Islamophobichate.

Harjot Singh, a nephew of the store owner who works as a cashier there, told the Advocate that attacking anyone for their religious identity isn’t acceptable.

“Even if it was Muslims, he shouldn’t have done that thing,” said Singh, who immigrated to the U.S. from India two years ago. “We’re just trying to make a living out of here, that’s all we’re doing.”

A piece of plywood now covers what was formerly a plate glass window at the store.The damage is estimated at around $4,000, according to local station WAFB TV.

Horsley joined the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve in 2014, but washonorably discharged in Decemberbecause of liver disease, according to the New York Daily News.

Before that, starting in 2010, he served for six years as a deputy in nearby East Baton Rouge Parish in both a full-time and reserve capacity.

“He blamed Muslims for killing his fellow service members overseas,” Sheriff Jason Ard said in a Facebook post on Monday. “He was also upset that Muslims, in his mind, were having an easier time prospering than he was despite his time in the service.”

It was allegedly Horsley himself who reported the crash to police, claiming to be a witness who tried to intervene until the driver of the truck pulled a gun on him.

Investigators also allege that Horsley had been in the store a week before the incident andfalsely claimed he worked for a sheriff’s office. He reportedly told the on-duty cashier that he was suspected of dealing drugs from the store, according to The Washington Post. He also allegedly said he would be back around midnight to search the store, and to “make sure no one was around.”

Horsley’s father, Samuel Horsley, told the New York Daily News he doesn’t believe the alleged act was motivated by hatred. Instead, he said, his son “must’ve just snapped.”

“I’m in shock because that’s not my son,” he said. “He’s about as far from a racist as they come. I did not raise my kids that way [but] taught them to always look at people in their heart.”

"A local man is facing charges after a traffic stop in Brookline last week. Chidera Ihenetu, 24, of Milton, was arrested at 5:48 p.m. on Feb. 12, and charged with operating after suspension and a red light violation. According to a Brookline Police Department arrest report, a patrol officer was monitoring traffic at the intersection of Boylston and Lee streets and observed a black sedan heading west that failed to stop at a red light.

"Fairfax County police say there is no indication the murder of a 17-year-old Muslim girl, who was walking with a group of friends near their mosque, was based on the victims religion.

WASHINGTON — Police say road rage led to the death of a 17-year-old girl who was walking to a Sterling mosque after a pre-dawn trip to McDonald’s with a group of other teens early Sunday morning.

The Fairfax County police identified the girl as Nabra Hassanen, of Reston, on Monday evening.

Darwin A. Martinez Torres, 22, of Sterling, has been charged with murder in the girl’s death. Police said Monday evening that he assaulted Hassanen twice, including with a baseball bat. He was arraigned Monday in Fairfax County and ordered held without bail pending a July 19 court appearance.

In a news conference Monday evening, the police said up to 15 teenagers, including Hassanen, were walking and riding bicycles on Dranesville Road at about 3:40 a.m. Sunday. They were headed from a nearby McDonald’s back to the All Dulles Area Muslim Society mosque, or ADAMS Center, on Sugarland Road in Sterling, where they were taking part in an all-night sleepover event.

Torres drove up to the teenagers and got into an argument with one of the boys, whose bike was in the roadway, said police spokeswoman Julie Parker. The group scattered as Torres allegedly drove his car up on a curb chasing the teenagers.

The police said that witnesses reported seeing Torres catch up with the teenagers in a parking lot, get out of his car and chase the teens on foot with a baseball bat. Police say he caught up to Hassanen, who was on foot, hit her once with the bat, then took her in his car to Loudoun County.

The other teens returned to the ADAMS Center, and someone called 911 to report the girl missing, police said. Police discovered what were believed to be her remains in an office park pond in Loudoun County Sunday evening.

The police said Monday evening that the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the upper body. They added that one of the two assaults happened in Loudoun County.

The case may be prosecuted in Loudoun County “due to elements of the various crimes and where they occurred,” Parker said.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement that Torres is a citizen of El Salvador, and that they’ve lodged a detainer on him. “ICE lodges detainers on aliens who have been arrested on local criminal charges when the agency has probable cause to believe an alien is removable from the United States,” they said. “Mr. Martinez Torres has no prior encounters with ICE.”

The attack happened during Ramadan — the month when observant Muslims fast between sunrise and sundown — sparking fears that the girl was targeted. But the police said detectives had found no evidence that the teen was killed because of her religion.

“There is nothing to indicate at this point this tragic case was a hate crime,” Parker said. “No evidence has been recovered that shows this murder … was motivated by race or by religion. It appears the suspect became so enraged over this traffic argument that it escalated into deadly violence.”

The girl’s father told The Associated Press that he doesn’t understand how this could have happened, because, he said, his daughter was a friend to everyone.

Police Lt. Bryan Holland said there was no indication of racial slurs “other than a verbal argument. … It was just an argument between a driver and a bicyclist who was in the roadway.”

Holland said Torres didn’t give any indication as to why he was so enraged.

The ADAMS Center — one of the largest mosques in the country — referred to the girl as “our dear daughter, sister and friend.”

“We are devastated and heartbroken as our community undergoes and processes this traumatic event. It is a time for us to come together to pray and care for our youth,” the center said in a statement.

Police said there was no known relationship between Torres and Hassanen, or any of the other teens.

“How can I even begin to convey our sadness and sorrow at the loss of a beautiful young girl, whose death has come not only too soon, but in the most tragic and brutal means possible,” Deputy Police Chief Tom Ryan said.

“I can assure you that justice cannot bring Nabra Hassanen back, but justice will be done.”

To the Muslim community, and the community as a whole, Ryan said, “When crimes such as this occur, our officers take it personal.” He added the police department is grieving with Hassanen’s family.

He assured the county’s residents that “you can rest assured that everything should be done in this case will be done.”

He said the question of where to prosecute the case is “a matter under discussion” with commonwealth’s attorneys — Ray Morrogh of Fairfax County and Jim Plowman of Loudoun County.

Sharon Bulova, chair of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, recounted a “very moving” visit to the ADAMS Center, which she called “a pillar in our community” and “a place where law enforcement comes regularly … to be there as a friend, and to make sure that that community knows that when there is trouble, when there is unrest, they can consider our Fairfax County police … there to protect their interests,” adding that she felt the same was true of Loudoun County.

Bulova said that a vigil would be held Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. at Lake Anne Plaza, in Reston, sponsored by the South Lakes High School Muslim Students Association.

"OAK FOREST, IL -- A Brookfield business owner is facing felony charges after she allegedly pocketed an Oak Forest home owners deposit for work she did not complete, prosecutors said Tuesday in court. Deborah Van Buren, 48, appeared before Cook County Judge Peter Felice on a charge of aggravated home repair fraud. Court records also indicate a similar charge in Oak Lawn. The prosecutor said on July 19, 2015, the Oak Forest homeowner entered into a contractual agreement with Van Buren to build a 5-foot-tall fence around his property at an estimated price of $6,800. Van Buren required a 60-percent deposit. The homeowner made out a personal check for $5,000, which he claims that he hand-delivered to Van Buren on July 29, 2015. Van Burens company showed up on Sept. 25, 2015 to begin the installation. The prosecutor said that holes dug on the homeowners property failed a city inspection. When the work had still not been corrected, a letter was sent in January to Van Buren asking her to finish the work or return the homeowners deposit. A second certified letter was sent last month, informing Van Buren that she had ten days to make good on the contract, according to court records. Van Buren allegedly did not respond to the letter and was arrested on Nov. 1, the prosecutor said. Judge Felice set bail at $75,000. Van Burens next hearing is Nov. 28 in Bridgeview. A business called Illinois Iron and Fence, Inc. is registered to Burens listed address in the 3900 block of South Circle Drive, in Brookfield.",0

Raley’s will open ‘Superstore’: Raley’s Superstore, a new 62,000-square-foot facility, will be the anchor store for Cypress Plaza Center, the new 121,000-square-foot shopping center located off Highway 4 near Big Break Marina.

Groundbreaking for the new store is scheduled for December of this year, with completion set for July of 1988, according to Nancy Douglas, advertising and marketing director for Albert D. Seeno Construction Company, the company building the shopping center.

In addition to Raley’s, the new Cypress Plaza Center will showcase several other retail outlets, banks and restaurants. Because of the close proximity to the Delta, the exterior will be of a nautical theme, with extensive landscaping planned.

Raley’s will be the first major grocery chain facility in Oakley. Built by the Seeno Company, Cypress Plaza Center will be the second Raley’s-Seeno shopping center developed in East Contra Costa. The first Raleys built by Seeno is on Buchanan Road in Pittsburg.

The Raley’s Superstore contains up to 45 different departments in addition to the grocery operation. Additional departments include a delicatessen, bakery, health food department, pharmacy, and travel center.

“We need a supermarket, I’m thrilled about it.” Jean Livesay of Oakley said. “I think there’s enough people in Oakley to support a big store.”

“I’ll probably go there for everyday needs because I’ll save gas not having to drive into Antioch or Brentwood, but their prices are higher than a lot of other places so I won’t do my major shopping there,” Kay Nation of Oakley said.

Judy Wolf asked: “Do they plan on installing a signal light there first? Traffic is bad here.”

Home vandalism in Brentwood and a fire at an Islamic center in Antioch raise red flags, group says: A pair of hate-related crimes in Eastern Contra Costa County has piqued the interest of a Tri-Valley coalition geared toward race relations.

Recent incidents in Brentwood and Antioch will be the focus of a meeting Tuesday of the Tri-Valley Hate Crime Coalition, a group of school and law enforcement officials created seven years ago to systematically address race-related crime.

“Both areas are working towards a similar goal, so it will be good to have the communities in the same place at the same time,” said Booker Neal, a senior mediator for the U.S. Department of Justice.

The coalition includes the school districts and police departments for all five Tri-Valley towns — Dublin, Livermore, San Ramon, Pleasanton and Danville — the Contra Costa and Alameda county sheriff’s departments, local district attorney offices and the U.S. Department of Justice.

“It’s a problem that isn’t contained to one area,” said Rick Lemyre, co-chairman of the Brentwood Diversity Committee. “We’re basically going to answer any of their questions and see what they’re doing.”

The Tri-Valley coalition was formed after an African-American teenager was beaten at San Ramon’s Central Park in April 2000. The attackers allegedly yelled racial epithets while fleeing the scene, though hate crime charges were not filed in the case.

On Aug. 22, an African-American family in Brentwood had their home ransacked and spray-painted with racial epithets. Earlier in the month, the Islamic Center of the East Bay, in Antioch was the target of an arson fire that gutted the building.

David Schneider of the local chapter of the Anti-Defamation League has been involved with the Brentwood Diversity Committee in helping the Brentwood family get back on its feet.

He will be discussing that case and the arson at Tuesday’s meeting.

“These communities both have been very proactive,” Neal said, noting the Tri-Valley has also been mindful of race changes. “Both have similar standard operating procedures in place so when something comes up, they can deal with it.”

In the past 10 years, the population in the Tri-Valley — particularly in East Dublin and the Dougherty Valley — has changed demographically, as more Asians have moved into new homes.

In the 1996-1997 school year, Asian-American students made up 7 percent of the students in Dublin schools; in 2006-2007, they account for more than 21 percent.

In the San Ramon Valley school district the Asian student population went from just under 10 percent to 17 percent over the decade. Some of the newer Dougherty Valley schools are more than 50 percent Asian.

“We know that with the new high school (Dougherty Valley High) and all the new schools, it’s important to stay on top of race issues,” said John Skeel, a San Ramon parks and community services division manager. “With the mixture of middle- and low-income housing in newer neighborhoods, that could be an issue as well.”

Community leaders in San Joaquin County will also be trying to glean information from the meeting. Rev. Willie Douglas, a Stockton minister and part of the NAACP’s Hate Crime Coalition, wants to create a similar committee in Manteca.

“What a blessing that concerned individuals are stepping up to secure methods to address the issue and safeguard our communities,” Douglas said, adding he hopes to learn lessons that would help in the creation of a Manteca committee.

The question of racial tolerance in that city was raised in July when a man from a neighboring community allegedly assaulted an African-American teenager outside a Manteca park.

"A local chef will spend three years in jail for spitting in someones food. John Stagg, 33, of Independence Township, pled guilty to tampering with food last October at Kennedys Pub in Mt. Olive. He was on parole during the time of the incident, nj.com reported. At a hearing earlier this year, Stagg admitted that he spit on a customers roll after a dispute, but contended he never actually served the tainted food. Stagg said he was frustrated because the customer kept sending her plate back again and again, the report said. A co-worker of Staggs called police after she saw the incident, police said. Earlier this year in court, Stagg said the co-worker was out to get his job. The 51-year-old customer, from Lake Hopatcong, was notified of the incident, police said. The guilty plea is Staggs third conviction. He previously spent more than eight years in prison for a robbery conviction in Warren County. The jail sentence will run concurrent with a four-year term, the report said, after Stagg pleaded guilty to eluding police during a traffic stop in May 2011. At his last court appearance in April, Stagg rejected the three-year plea deal. Stagg was fired from Kennedys shortly after the incident occurred.

"Police in Fresno, California revealed new details today on the hate crime shooting that killed three people in just minutes on Tuesday morning and what allegedly inspired the suspect to commit the murders.

Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer said in a press conference Wednesday that suspect Kori Ali Muhammad -- born Kori McDonald -- was inspired to carry out the attack after learning on local news that he was the suspect of another murder at a local motel.

Thats when Muhammad -- armed with a revolver -- decided that he was going to kill as many white males as possible, Dyer said, adding that the Muhammad told investigators that he did not like white men. Muhammad has also written anti-government sentiments on social media as well as posts saying that he does not like white people, the police chief said Tuesday.

Around 10:45 a.m. Tuesday, Muhammad fired 17 shots in about three minutes, Dyer said.

During the shooting rampage, Muhammad fired several times at two Hispanic women in a car, but he stopped shooting once he realized they were Hispanic and let them go, Dyer said. Muhammad also fired at a group of men at a bus stop and chased after one man, who was the heaviest and oldest of the group. That man became his final victim, Dyer said.

Muhammad was arrested shortly after the shooting and has since given detectives several hours of interviews describing his actions, Dyer said. The suspect lead detectives through the murder scenes and explained to investigators what he did and why, laughing while he made the descriptions, Dyer said.

Fresno Police via AP

Muhammad was already wanted for allegedly murdering a Motel 6 security guard who was identified by Dyer today as 25-year-old Carl Williams. The murder occurred last week, Dyer said.

Muhammad fired at Williams because he said the security guard disrespected him, Dyer said.

Muhammad led investigators through the crime scene at the motel as well as the locations from yesterdays shootings, Dyer said.

Muhammad told detectives that he is Muslim but hadnt been to mosque in 20 years and prays to numerous gods, Dyer said. The suspect also said that he had been practicing voodoo rituals and is not a terrorist or affiliated with any terror groups.

Dyer said that officers witnessed Muhammad yell Allahu akbar at the scene of the shooting. Dyer described Muhammad as a racist rather than a terrorist.

On Tuesday morning, Muhammad had gone to buy items to practice voodoo rituals when he went to Starbucks instead, Dyer said. While there, he used Stabucks Wi-Fi to watch a broadcast from ABC Fresno station KFSN, which identified him as a suspect in Williams murder.

Police were alerted to the scene Tuesday through ShotSpotter, a gunfire locator that detected multiple gunshots in the same vicinity, Dyer said Tuesday. Dyer played audio of the shots fired recorded by ShotSpotter during todays press conference.

Muhammad did not run from Fresno police officers because he said he respected them, according to the police chief. Muhammad said he didnt want police to be forced to shoot him and that he is not a coward.

Once he saw the officers on the scene, Muhammad got on the ground, Dyer said Tuesday.

Dyer identified the victims of yesterdays shooting, which included 37-year-old Mark Gassett, 58-year-old David Jackson and 34-year-old Pacific Gas and Electric Company worker Zachary Randalls. Dyer showed pictures of Randalls family photos with his children after identifying him.

Randalls was driven to police in a PG&E truck, Dyer said Tuesday.

It is unclear if McDonald has entered a plea or retained an attorney.

The gun has not been located after it was wrapped in clothing and picked up by someone on the scene, Dyer said, describing the man who took it as Hispanic.

Dyer asked for the man who took the gun to turn himself in immediately. The man fled from the scene after taking the gun, the police chief said.

Muhammad spoke to his mother Tuesday night after he was arrested, Dyer said.

During the rampage, Muhammad shot at a resident who he encountered in the neighborhood multiple times but missed, Dyer said Tuesday. He then shot and killed the man he encountered next.

Muhammad dropped shell casings and reloaded his gun before setting of to Catholic Charities on North Fulton Street in Fresno, where he shot and killed a man he encountered in the parking lot, Dyer said Tuesday.

Aaron Van Curen, who lives near Catholic Charities, said he didnt believe what he was witnessing when he heard multiple gunshots. Gassett was killed near his home, Van Curen said. Once he saw that the shooter had left the scene, he went outside to feel for a pulse, and there wasnt one, he said.

He was obviously dead at that point... Van Curen said, adding that he then waited for police to arrive.

Dyer said Tuesday night that he did not believe the murders were related to terrorism and that the shootings were solely based on race.",1
"Beware of people bearing free ice cream. On Wednesday, police arrested a Somerset man for allegedly using a nonprofit organization to convince hundreds of senior citizens to submit to unnecessary genetic testing, the U.S. Attorneys Office (NJ) announced. As a result of the alleged scam, Seth Rehfuss, 41, bilked the federal Medicare system out of more than $1 million, obtaining tens of thousands of dollars in commissions, prosecutors charge. Rehfuss was scheduled to appear in Newark federal court on Wednesday. According to authorities, beginning in July of 2014, Rehfuss and other unidentified persons used the Point Pleasant-based Good Samaritans of America as a front to gain access to several low-income senior housing complexes, claiming that the nonprofit helped seniors to navigate federal benefit programs. However, authorities are charging that once Rehfuss had access to the housing complexes, he used fear-based tactics to swindle the elderly residents into submitting to genetic testing, warning them that they were vulnerable to heart attacks, stroke, cancer and suicide if they didnt take his advice. In an effort to increase attendance at his presentations, Rehfuss would advertise that free ice cream would be available, authorities stated. During the presentations, Rehfuss and other participants would take DNA swabs from the senior citizens, always without the involvement or recommendation of any healthcare provider, prosecutors say. In order to get the tests authorized, Rehfuss then allegedly used advertisements on Craigslist to recruit healthcare providers for the scheme, posting advertisements for a Part-time doctor, physicians assistant or nurse practitioner, 2 hours a week, $2,000 (Your Office). After entering into contractual relationships with The Good Samaritans of America, the healthcare providers received requisition forms that often included the patients personal information, Medicare information, medication lists and diagnosis codes. The healthcare providers were paid thousands of dollars per month to sign their names to requisition forms authorizing testing for patients that they never examined. As a result, the Medicare program paid more than $1 million to two clinical laboratories in California and Virginia and Rehfuss collected tens of thousands of dollars for his efforts, authorities allege. According to prosecutors, Rehfuss and other unnamed confederates were actively working towards expanding the scheme outside New Jersey into other states such as Georgia, Delaware, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Michigan, Mississippi, Florida, Tennessee and Arizona. The charge of healthcare fraud carries a maximum potential penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense, prosecutors stated.",0

"“Akyra Monet Murray, 18 years old.”

It was one year ago when I first heard that name. My sister and I stood outside of New York City’s Stonewall Inn, as the names of the 49 victims of the Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting were read aloud—one by one.

I didn’t know Akyra. All I knew was her name. And that she was my “little” sister’s age.

I squeezed my sister’s hand so tightly, wishing with every fiber in my being that my grip could be enough to protect her from something so heinous. As the names continued to be announced, I felt weak and light headed—the victims could have been my sister and me.

The horrific massacre began to sink in and it hit devastatingly close to home.

Like myself, the 49 victims were mostly Latinx men in their twenties. Like myself, the 49 victims were mostly gay men who sometimes enjoyed dancing the night away at a gay nightclub with friends. Like myself, my 49 LGBTQ brothers and sisters probably shared the view that gay nightclubs like Pulse represented a safe space where people like us could be ourselves authentically. And like myself, they never imagined something like this could happen to them.

But it did happen. And it happened in the form of the deadliest hate crime in our nation’s history. For those of us at the intersection of these communities—if you were queer and/or a person of color—it was a sobering wake-up call. In spite of reaching many milestones in our struggle to create a more just, more inclusive, and more equal nation, for many of us, our lives never felt more threatened simply for being ourselves.

We shared in this plight. Together, we overcame this difficult time with support from our allies because we understood that our oppression was intersectional. We understood that we were stronger together.

In the middle of a contentious election, this was a test of character.

Many politicians took to Twitter to announce their “thoughts and prayers are with Orlando.” Yet, they refused to acknowledge this as a hate crime, opting instead to capitalize on the pain and the agony of our community by calling this a terrorist attack. The media further propelled this narrative.

Donald Trump took it a step further, blaming Hillary Clinton for the incident while simultaneously trying to pit the LGBTQ community against Muslims, or as he referred to them in a tweet: “people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs.”

But amid the mixed feelings of fear, anger, and grief that I and many other LGBTQ people shared, Hillary Clinton had a unifying message of togetherness for LGBTQ and all Americans:

Another act of terrorism in a place no one expected. A madman filled with hate, with guns in his hands, and just a horrible sense of vengeance and vindictiveness in his heart, apparently consumed by rage against LGBT Americans, and by extension, the openness and diversity that defines our American way of life.

Her message was the catalyst that turned my fear, my anger, and my grief into a purpose: To do everything in my power to elect Secretary Hillary Clinton as our next president. Together, we inspired 66 million Americans to vote for a platform that was grounded on justice, inclusion, and equality.

That platform seems less and less tangible with a new administration that poses a threat to disenfranchised communities. But the memory of the 49 victims we lost must embolden us to continue the fight for justice, inclusion, and equality. It would be dangerous to ignore the pervasive culture of violence and deep-rooted bigotry towards our most vulnerable and disenfranchised communities. Above all, it would be a disservice to the human lives we lost.

This Pride Month, I call on everyone to make a pledge to Akyra and our 48 beautiful queer brothers and sisters to never forget and to never stop fighting for equality. Showing your support at a march is a great way to show solidarity, but it shouldn’t stop there. If you’re an ally, get to know the stories behind the LGBTQ people who are present in your everyday life—your coworker, your neighbor. And if you’re queer—and have the privilege to do so—be fearless. Tell your story whenever possible.",1
"Updated at 7:30 p.m. May 6, 2015: Sheriffs officials confirmedMay 6 that a man serving jail time in San Bernardino for auto theft has been linked by DNA to the December murders of a La Verne businessman and his wife. Luke Fabela, 23, has been behind bars since mid-January, according to the Sheriffs Department. Although DNA has linked him to the Dec. 26 killings of 89-year-old Armie Troy Isom and his 74-year-old wife Shirley, investigators have not determined a motive for the crime, according to the departments Nicole Nishida. Isom and his wife were found by a groundskeeper at their multimillion- dollar home abutting open land in an unincorporated area near La Verne. The woman died from blunt force injuries and her husband died later in the day from being beaten and stabbed, authorities said. Nishida said Fabela will serve his time in San Bernardino before being brought to Los Angeles for a trial here. She said detectives presented the case to the Los Angeles County District Attorneys Office, but prosecutors have requested additional investigation. A suspect was earlier identified from a video that showed a person wearing a hooded jacket and carrying a backpack. Nishida said it was unknown if the killings may have been precipitated by several pending lawsuits involving Isom, who was a wealthy businessman. In March, Darci S. Isom, the daughter of Armie Isom, filed suit against the daughter of Shirley Isom, alleging fraud and elder abuse. She accused Mischelynn Scarlatelli of conspiring to take control of the estate, thereby altering the rights of inheritance of daughter Darci and her brother and sister.

"Protect and Serve Act passes House. File under bipartisan-is-just-another-word-for-both-sides-licking-the-same-boot: majorities of both Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives have voted in favor of new hate crime legislation that sets up cops as a protected class.

Overall, just 35 House members voted against the bill (H.R. 5698), which isnt far from making it a federal crime to resist arrest. Under the so-called Protect and Serve Act, anyone who injures or attempts to injure a police officer will be guilty of a federal offense—no matter how small the injury and no matter if it was intentional—if the offense has some connection to or effect on interstate commerce.

The House Liberty Caucus opposed the creation of this new federal hate crime, which it said violates the Constitution—the 10th Amendment grants authority to prosecute offenses against state and local cops only to the states—and furthers the dangerous federalization of criminal law.

The House just voted overwhelmingly to pass new federal hate crime legislation. Members of the @libertycaucus joined me to oppose this bill in accordance with the Constitution. https://t.co/gXz0rgo2mE #5thAmendment #10thAmendment #equalprotection #federalism https://t.co/fjyEAHFXEv — Justin Amash (@justinamash) May 16, 2018

An increasing amount of conduct once only punished at the local level is now falling under the purview of the FBI, the Department of Homeland Securitys HSI unit, and immigration agents. (If the shift from community policing to more metrics-based and militaristic models has had bad effects on civilian-cop relations and incarceration rates, just think how much more damage FBI and ICE agents can rack up!)

Lawmakers are justifying the Protect and Serve Act using (what else?) the Commerce Clause. But this does not significantly narrow the range of covered offenses or avoid the constitutional violation, said the Liberty Caucus statement.

A tenuous connection to economic activity cannot transform a criminal law that has nothing to do with economic activity—and that is is explicitly for the purpose of public safety—into a regulation of interstate commerce. If it could, the Commerce Clause would destroy the Constitutions design for a very limited federal role in criminal law enforcement, covering only a few crimes that are clearly federal in nature.

That ship has long since sailed, alas. But good on the (lonely!) Liberty Caucus for at least trying to stand up against Congress use of the Commerce Clause like an incantation that overcomes the Constitution.

A related bill in the Senate is currently with the Judiciary Committee.

FOSTA unambiguously evil, says law professor; bad effects continue to accumulate. When a bill banning prostitution ads passed the Senate, a four-hour procession of lawmakers ascended the rostrum to congratulate each other on a rare act of bipartisanship, writes Susan Du at City Pages. The bill in question was never really up for debate. It was sold as way to rein back a modern surge in the sexual enslavement of women and girls, making use of the internet to enable prostitution punishable by up to 10 years in prison. But if the bill, known as FOSTA, was supposed to protect sex workers, no one bothered to consult them, writs Du. The threat to their well-being was immediate.

Trump signed FOSTA in April, but we started seeing its effects almost as soon as the bill passed. By now, weve seen the demise of a slew of sites where sex workers advertise, exchange safety tips, and otherwise communicate. Its also forcing everything from sex-education sites to popular social media platforms to ban discussions of prostitution and even all talk of sex-worker rights and safety.

Scott Cunningham, a Baylor University law professor who has studied the effect of the digital sphere on prostitution, called FOSTA unambiguously evil. From City Pages:

His 2017 study on Craigslists personals section is the only empirical analysis of online sex ads effect on violence against women. Its conclusion: The internet reduced female homicides by 17.4 percent. If you care about violence against women—and you should—you absolutely need to care about how FOSTA is unambiguously harming these women, Cunningham says. And if you believe that most of this market is just trafficked women, or if you define trafficking through the sleight of hand that basically says, philosophically, all prostitution is sex trafficking, you need to talk to some sex workers and ask them if theyre trafficked.

OF FLORIDA

Hate-crime protections would be extended to law-enforcement officers and other First responders under a measure reintroduced Monday by Sen. Rene Garcia, R-Hialeah.

Under the proposal (SB 178), criminal penalties would be increased when “crimes evidencing prejudice” are committed against law-enforcement officers or other emergency workers.

As an example, first-degree misdemeanors would be upgraded to third-degree felonies in such cases. Tougher penalties are already in place to deal with hate crimes based on race, color, ancestry, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, national origin, homeless status or advanced age.

Garcia’s proposal also would extend the protection based on a victim’s sex or creed.

The bill is filed for the 2018 legislative session, which starts in January. Garcia proposed a similar measure for the 2017 session, but it did not get heard in committees.",1
