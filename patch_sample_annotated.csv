"UPDATED–Dr. David B. Cohen, the surgeon who was shot Thursday at Johns Hopkins Hospital in East Baltimore, has been upgraded to good condition, according to hospital spokesman Gary Stephenson. The family issued a statement Monday regarding  the incident. We are deeply appreciative of the outpouring of support and concern for us during this difficult time, the statement said.  We are especially grateful to everyone at Johns Hopkins who worked to make Davids recovery possible. Now it is important that  our time and energy be focused on Davids recovery.  David is in good condition and continuing to recover more and more every day.  We are asking the media to please respect our privacy during this time of healing.  Thanks for your understanding. Meanwhile, Baltimore police searched the Virginia home of the shooter while the citys police commissioner met with other city universities to review coordinated emergency response procedures. Cohen is expected to make a full recovery, although it is unclear when he will be discharged from the hospital. Cohens family and friends asked the media to respect her familys right to privacy. They are a very private family, Stephenson said. The Cohens Cockeysville neighbors have said that Cohen and his family keep mostly to themselves. Paul Warren Pardus, 50, shot Cohen in the abdomen after becoming dissatisfied with the quality of care being given to his mother. After shooting Cohen, Pardus turned the gun on his mother, killing her and then himself. The Baltimore Police Department obtained warrants today to search Parduss home in the 2100 block of South Kenmore Street in Arlington for evidence of a pre-meditated attack. It looks like he may have taken some time off recently to care for this mother who was ill. Theres nothing right now that points to the fact that this was a pre-meditated attack against Johns Hopkins or the doctor, said Anthony Guglielmi, spokesman for the Baltimore Police Department. He was just dissatisfied with the quality care that she received at the hospital and he unfairly took it out on the doctor. When reports of gunfire in the hospital first emerged, Baltimore police immediately began working with Hopkins security staff, among others, to restore safety to the facility. Guglielmi said police Commissioner Frederick Bealefeld was very pleased with the response, but the department wanted to take the opportunity to improve existing security measures. Hopkins, when we went in there, it was so turn-key that it was almost like their security force was an extension of the BPD, Guglielmi said. We were all speaking the same language. They understood the command structure. Bealefeld today met with the heads of all universities and most hospitals in the Baltimore area to review response protocol. We want to make sure that (system) exists at other places, God forbid we get a campus gunman or a Virginia Tech incident on our hands here in Baltimore, Guglielmi said. The time that it would take for the police department to go in and set up an infrastructure and make sure that everyone is on the same page is valuable time that could mean the difference of living and dying.",0

"ATMORE, AL — Torrey Twane McNabb raised his middle fingers as he was put to death Thursday night for the killing of a cop. McNabbs attorneys had unsuccessfully sought to stop the execution since he was one of several inmates in an ongoing lawsuit challenging the humaneness of the states lethal injection procedure. Before he was put to death, he cursed the state and said: I hate you. McNabb was convicted of killing Montgomery police officer Anderson Gordon in 1997. He shot Gordon five times as the officer sat in his patrol car after arriving at a traffic accident McNabb caused while fleeing a bail bondsman, prosecutors said. Watch: Man Executed For Killing Alabama Police Officer Gordons relatives said in a statement that the 30-year-old officer — known as Brother — was devoted to his family, his two children and his work as a police officer. Over 20 years ago, we lost a companion, a father, a brother and friend who only wanted to make a difference in his community, the statement read. Although, the wounds of having a family member murdered can never be healed, through this tragedy, the Gordon family has remained strong and will continue to be resilient. The inmates in the lawsuit have argued that the sedative midazolam does not reliably render a person unconscious before subsequent drugs stop their lungs and heart. They point to an execution last December during which an Alabama inmate coughed and heaved for the first 13 minutes of the procedure. McNabb appeared to be breathing for the first 20 minutes of the 35-minute long procedure. He later appeared to move his head, grimace and raise his arms after two consciousness checks in which a guard pinches his arm, says his name and pulls back his eyelid — before eventually becoming still. His family members and attorneys who witnessed the execution expressed repeated concerns to each other that he was still conscious during the lethal injection. Hes going to wake up, one of McNabbs family members whispered. He was pronounced dead at 9:38 p.m. CDT, authorities said. Alabama Commissioner Jeff Dunn said he was confident the movements after the second consciousness check were involuntary and that McNabb was not awake. A lawyer for McNabb argued that it would be wrong to carry out the execution while proceedings continue in McNabbs lawsuit. The state argued that the inmates are unlikely to prevail in their claims since the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed other executions, including four in Alabama, to proceed using midazolam. The attorney generals office argued McNabb had presented nothing new to justify a stay. The U.S. Supreme Court delayed the execution for more than two hours to consider McNabbs request for a stay, but ruled that the execution could go forward.

"NAPA - A 22-year-old man in a Napa homeless camp stabbed an older man he was apparently dating late Monday night, and has been charged with attempted murder. Napa resident Jeffrey Alexander Funes was arrested when he returned to the camp as officers were processing the crime scene. Just before 11 p.m., officers were sent to a report of a stabbing in the 500 block of Lincoln Avenue. When they arrived, they found a 51-year-old man on a residential porch, bleeding from a stab wound to the stomach. The homeowner did not know the victim, who was transported to Queen of the Valley Medical Center, where police say he was treated for his wound. At last report, the stabbing victim is recovering in the ICU. Police say initially the victim was uncooperative on the porch with officers, but provided a statement at the hospital. The victim told officers that he and Jeffrey Funes are in a dating relationship and live together in a homeless camp in the area. According to Napa police, the victim told them Funes stabbed him in the stomach with a large knife while in their camp. Funes immediately left the area, according to the statement, and the victim went to the residential house for help. Napa officers went to the camp site where the incident occurred to process the crime scene. Moments later, Funes returned to the camp and was taken into custody. A knife was located in the camp site and police say Funes identified it as the one he used to stab the victim. During the interview with officers, police say Funes admitted to the stabbing and said it was planned. Authorities found out that Funes has two current Napa County probations with terms including obey all laws and search and seizure. Jeffrey Alexander Funes was booked at the Napa County Department of Corrections.",0
"SAN JOSE - A Santa Clara police officer was convicted Monday of indecent exposure at a high-end San Jose store last year. A Santa Clara County Superior Court jury found Thomas Leipelt, 46, guilty of the single misdemeanor charge today after a three-day trial before Judge Paul Bernal at the Hall of Justice in San Jose. Leipelt was off-duty when he exposed himself to an employee at Annieglass, a luxury glassware store at Santana Row Shopping Center, while visiting his girlfriend on May 15. You always have to respect the jury in their verdict but Im very, very disappointed and just having a hard time understanding how they came to that conclusion given what happened in the trial, Leipelts attorney Cameron Bowman said after todays verdict. Bowman said he plans to ask the court for Leipelt to be released and will appeal the verdict. Leipelt was placed into custody and is scheduled for sentencing on Wednesday, when he faces up to a year in county jail, Bowman said. Leipelt could also be required to register as a sex offender for life. The employee who made the complaint testified that she went to retrieve documents from a printer in the stores back room, where she saw Leipelt naked and masturbating. The employee said Leipelt asked her to come here but she refused and stepped back out to the payment counter. Leipelts then-girlfriend, who was the only other person working at the store, was speaking to friends at the front of the store when the incident occurred and repeatedly apologized to the employee. The victim said she informed her boss of the incident two days after and reported the incident to police later that month. Leipelt had testified that he was partially clothed and the employee walked in on him using the bathroom. Bowman argued last week that the victims testimony was unreliable and she failed to inform the court of a restraining order she filed in 2009 for indecent exposure. Leipelt has worked with Santa Clara police for 15 years and was placed on paid administrative leave in May, Santa Clara police Lt. Kurt Clarke said. The police administrative investigation into Leipelt can now be finalized with the criminal case coming to a close, Clarke said. Santa Clara County Deputy District Attorney Lindsay Walsh, who was the prosecutor on the case, said she thought the verdict was fair. Walsh said Leipelts story was completely unbelievable and the victims account has been consistent. -Bay City News, image via ShutterStock",0
"STAFFORD, CT — A 53-year-old Stafford resident has been charged in a neglect case that included a hypothermic child living in a home with 35-degree interior temperatures, an arrest warrant indicates. The investigation was initiated in December, when a Stafford Ambulance crew was sent to 18 West End St. in Stafford for a possible overdose. Vanessa Laskow was in the home, confused and unable to walk, and she admitted taking Klonopin and Codeine, according to a warrant. The home was unkempt and canine feces was located inside the house, according to a warrant. Parts of the home had an odor of spoiled food, according to a warrant. The inside temperature was 35 degrees and residents told authorities the home had been without heat for some time, according to a warrant. A wood stove was in the home but no wood was present, according to a warrant. The ambulance crew was concerned that a 7-month-old was hypothermic. A pillow had a bottle propped up in what seemed like a system for the youngster to feed himself, according to a warrant. Authorities said in a warrant the home was unfit for an infant. She apparently obtained the Klonopin from a relative who has schizophrenia, according to a warrant. Lawkow was charged with second-degree reckless endangerment and risk of injury to a child, according to a warrant. She is due in court in May 14, state police said.

"SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CA -- Police in Santa Clara are warning the public about a phone scam involving MoneyPak or GreenDot reloadable cash cards that has victimized some residents in the South Bay. According to police, scammers call victims and pose as city or federal employees. They tell the victims that they owe money for a traffic ticket, income tax, warrant or a late utility bill. The scammers then request immediate payment, and suggest that the easiest way to resolve the matter is to purchase a MoneyPak or GreenDot reloadable cash card, which can be purchased at a drug and or convenience store. According to police, the cards are similar to cash and are not traceable. Once the victim provides the suspect with the number on the back of the card, they can immediately download the value of that card anywhere in the world. According to police, no legitimate business would ask someone to make a payment this way. Anyone who receives a call like this should hang up and call the companys customer service phone number on their bill. Anyone with questions or concerns about this scam can contact the Santa Clara Police Department at (408) 615-4700. Bay City News contributed to this report/Image via Shutterstock Also See:",0

I happily chose serving as my career and it wouldnt have been possible if I hadnt been offered health insurance from my employer, says Jeri Casler, a server at Bryant Lake Bowl and Barbette. Bartmann said health insurance has been going up 20 percent to 30 percent a year for the last few years, and they cant continue to sustain those increases. Rather than just raising prices, we want to be transparent about our costs, she said. We think our customers will appreciate knowing that our workers have good quality, affordable health insurance. For Bartmann, providing health insurance to staff is an important part of her overarching vision of sustainability. All of our sustainability efforts -- solar panels, LEED certifications, composting, supporting local organic farms and permaculture, low-waste events -- are ultimately about human health, just like health coverage, notes Bartmann. Im committed to offering quality health insurance to our employees, whatever it takes. Bartmann sees a shifting landscape ahead for restaurants and customers, and service charges will be a part of it. We want to continue to take care of our staff and provide great food and experiences to our guests, notes Bartmann. To do that and be successful, I think well all have to get used to service charges.

"A local chef will spend three years in jail for spitting in someones food. John Stagg, 33, of Independence Township, pled guilty to tampering with food last October at Kennedys Pub in Mt. Olive. He was on parole during the time of the incident, nj.com reported. At a hearing earlier this year, Stagg admitted that he spit on a customers roll after a dispute, but contended he never actually served the tainted food. Stagg said he was frustrated because the customer kept sending her plate back again and again, the report said. A co-worker of Staggs called police after she saw the incident, police said. Earlier this year in court, Stagg said the co-worker was out to get his job. The 51-year-old customer, from Lake Hopatcong, was notified of the incident, police said. The guilty plea is Staggs third conviction. He previously spent more than eight years in prison for a robbery conviction in Warren County. The jail sentence will run concurrent with a four-year term, the report said, after Stagg pleaded guilty to eluding police during a traffic stop in May 2011. At his last court appearance in April, Stagg rejected the three-year plea deal. Stagg was fired from Kennedys shortly after the incident occurred.

"Orlando, FL — When Framingham native Angel Colon sat in front of cameras Tuesday describing the terror that unfolded inside the Pulse Orlando nightclub June 12, he lamented not remembering the name and face of the officer who pulled him to safety. That officer, Omar Delagado of Floridas Eatonville Police Department, remembered Colon. So much so, in fact, he paid him a visit at Orlando Regional Medical Center Thursday, where Colon continues to recover after being shot several times in the leg, hand and hip. The emotional reunion, captured on video, was the first time the two had seen each other since the tragedy occurred early Sunday morning. Watch it here: I need a big hug from you, Delgado said to Colon after explaining he was one of the officers who saved him. Im glad youre doing good, man. Colon was the first survivor of Sundays attack to speak out. He described the horror he witnessed as Omar Mateen, 29, fired into the crowded Pulse Orlando Night Club & Ultra Lounge Sunday. The popular gay bar had a near-capacity crowd as Mateen perpetrated what has since been called the largest mass shooting in American history. Classified by the federal government as an act of terror, Mateens rampage left 49 people dead and 53 wounded. It ended when police shot and killed Mateen. Colon recalled already being wounded after being shot three times in the leg. He was on the clubs floor with a shattered leg when Mateen began firing into the bodies of those already dead, he said during a Tuesday press conference. He shoots the girl next to me, Colon said. Im thinking, Im next, Im dead. Mateen fired toward Colons head but hit his hand. He fired again, striking Colon in the hip. As Colon continued to hear shots all around him, he remained very still, hoping to avoid capturing Mateens attention again. Thats when a police officer — whose face and name Colon couldnt remember — came and pulled him to safety. I was so happy, Colon said after meeting Delgado, according to ABC. Ive been wanting to see the man that took me out of that horrible place. YouTube screenshot courtesy of Wochit News",0

"WOBURN, MA -- A 36-year-old Woburn man with two prior arrests for lewdness was arrested by Woburn Police on Sunday after patrons of the Red Roof Inn allegedly saw him naked and committing a lewd act in the picture window of his fifth-floor hotel room. In Woburn District Court on Monday, Francis Nestico, 36, of Woburn, had his bail set at $1,000 cash after pleading not guilty to three counts of open and gross lewdness. If he posts bail, Judge Timothy Gailey ordered that Nestico stay away from the Red Roof Inn in Woburn and have no contact with the alleged victims. Prosecutors explained that at around 9 p.m. on May 14, a man and woman, patrons of the hotel, saw a naked man standing at his window in his fifth-floor room committing a lewd act. While it was dark outside, the man had his room lights on so he was visible, prosecutors allege. When the suspect allegedly looked directly at the woman, she gave him an obscene gesture, and he placed a shirt over his face and continued his lewd conduct, prosecutors allege. Hotel staff also noted Nesticos behavior, the prosecutor said. Prosecutors sought $2,500 cash bail, noting Nestico has two prior convictions for the same conduct in February 2016. In one case, a woman looked out her bedroom window and saw Nestico standing naked in his bedroom window and committing a lewd act while looking at her. In the second case, he was convicted of breaking and entering and open and gross lewdness after he was caught committing a lewd act in the kitchen of his downstairs neighbor, prosecutors said. Nesticos next court date is June 9. Photo by Lisa Redmond/lisa.redmond@patch.com.",0

"Two men were sentenced for their roles in a conspiracy to rob a drug stash house of multiple kilograms of cocaine they thought would be stored there, U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman said. Robert Smith, a/k/a Born, 43, of Trenton, Mercer County, and Derrick Adams, a/k/a Little D, 30, of Florence and Willingboro, Burlington County, were sentenced to 30 years and 10 years in prison, respectively. Smith was previously convicted of conspiracy to commit robbery, conspiracy to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine, possessing a firearm in connection with a crime of violence and a drug trafficking crime, and possessing a firearm as a previously-convicted felon. Adams previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit robbery and conspiracy to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine. They are each also subject to five years of supervised release. Smith and Adams were part of a conspiracy involving four other people to rob a drug stash house in Maple Shade, Burlington County, in January of 2014, according to documents filed in the case and evidence presented at trial. Text messages showed that Smith and Adams planned to rob the drug stash house while posing as police. Smith was recorded saying he was willing to kill the people in the house if necessary. However, the six men were confronted by special agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) unit when they went to rob the drug stash house on the morning of Jan. 30, 2014.

"IDAHO FALLS, ID — Like millions of others who have ordered DNA tests from a popular genealogy website, Kelli Rowlette was curious about her family tree. But she was floored by a web of deception revealed by the test: The man she had believed to be her biological father for 36 years wasnt a genetic match. Instead, her parents fertility doctor was her likely father. Rowlette, who knew nothing of her parents struggle to conceive her, initially thought the results from the Ancestry.com test were wrong. But when she questioned her now divorced parents, Sally Ashby and Howard Fowler, about the mysterious probable genetic match, Gerald Mortimer, they knew him quite well. He had delivered Kelli Rowlette. When the family moved away, he cried. But what no one knew until the DNA test was the secret now spelled out a federal malpractice lawsuit Rowlette and her parents filed in Idaho last week against Mortimer. In it, they accuse the retired gynecologist and obstetrician living in Idaho Falls of knowingly using his own sperm in 1980 to impregnate Sally Ashby. According to the complaint, Mortimer explained to the couple the reasons for their difficulty in conceiving were twofold: She had a tipped uterus and he had a low sperm count. Mortimer prescribed artificial insemination, and said Fowlers sperm would be mixed with the sperm of a suitable donor who matched their specifications — a college student taller than 6 feet with brown hair and blue eyes. Instead, though he did not match the parents specifications for a sperm donor, he used his own sperm in the procedure that resulted in Rowlettes birth nine months later, according to the complaint. After Mortimer delivered Rowlette, he continued to provide reproductive care for her mother, who later naturally conceived a son with Fowler without Mortimers assistance. When he became emotional at the prospect of the familys move from Idaho to Washington, Dr. Mortimer knew Kelli Rowlette was his biological daughter but did not disclose this to Ms. Ashby or Mr. Fowler, the complaint states. Though the secret lay dormant for more than 30 years, Rowlettes parents were devastated when they learned Mortimer was their daughters biological father, the complaint states, and struggled to cope with their own anguish and had difficulty contemplating the torment the discovery would cause their daughter. Rowlette and her family have been suffering immeasurably since the discovery, according to the lawsuit. Obstetrics and Gynecology Associates of Idaho Falls and Mortimers wife, Linda G. McKinnon Mortimer, are also named as a defendant in the lawsuit. The family is seeking more than $75,000 in damages. Patch was unsuccessful in attempts to reach Mortimer for a comment. A spokeswoman for Obstetrics and Gynecology Associates of Idaho Falls said he is no longer associated with the practice. None of the health care providers currently at Obstetrics and Gynecology Associates of Idaho Falls were part of the practice in 1979 to 1980 and they diligently strive to provide care to their patients that is in compliance with the standards of health care practice, the spokeswoman said, reading from a prepared statement.

He opened her door and still couldnt wake her by shouting, but she finally responded to a shake. He asked why she was in the middle of the road, and she said she wasnt – shed just gotten there. The woman couldnt find her drivers license, and told officers she hadnt been driving – shed been driven there by unknown male, she said. But police found no footprints in the fresh-fallen snow to suggest that. What they did find in the snow was a puddle of fresh urine. Also found in plain sight in the front seat of the car was a bag with two pipes and .61 gram of marijuana, so she was cited for that as well.

"LOS ANGELES (CNS) - The operators of seven alleged sham pop-up medical clinics and a Glendale-based criminal defense attorney were among a dozen defendants arrested Thursday on federal drug trafficking charges that accuse them of diverting at least 2 million prescription pills -- including oxycodone and other addictive narcotics -- to the streets. Two indictments returned late last month by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles allege that members of the conspiracy profited from illicit prescriptions that were issued without any legitimate medical purpose through a series of clinics that periodically opened and closed in a pop-up style. The alleged fraudulent prescriptions allowed the conspirators to obtain bulk quantities of prescription drugs that were sold on the street, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office. Those arrested include Minas Matosyan, an Encino man also known as Maserati Mike, who is charged with leading the scheme and controlling six of the sham clinics. Matosyan allegedly hired corrupt doctors who allowed the conspirators to issue fraudulent prescriptions under their names in exchange for kickbacks. The two indictments charge 14 defendants who allegedly participated in an elaborate scheme they mistakenly hoped would conceal a high-volume drug trafficking operation, said acting U.S. Attorney Sandra R. Brown. In addition to generating illicit profits, this scheme helped drive the prescription drug epidemic that is causing so much harm across our nation. The indictments and search warrants describe how Matosyan would allegedly rent out recruited doctors to sham clinics in exchange for kickbacks derived from proceeds generated when the other bogus clinics created fraudulent prescriptions or submitted fraudulent bills to health care programs. In one example described in court documents, Matosyan allegedly provided a corrupt doctor to a clinic owner in exchange for $120,000. When the clinic failed to pay the money and suggested instead that Matosyan take back the corrupt doctor, Matosyan demanded his money and said, Doctors are like underwear to me. I dont take back used things, according to the document. In a recorded conversation also described in court papers, Matosyan allegedly discussed how one doctor was paid for sitting at home, while thousands of narcotic pills were prescribed in that physicians name and Medicare was billed more than $500,000 for purported patient care. The conspirators also allegedly stole the identities of doctors who refused to participate in the scheme. In an intercepted telephone conversation described in court documents, Matosyan allegedly offered a doctor a deal to sit home making $20,000 a month doing nothing. When the doctor refused the offer, the conspirators nevertheless created prescription pads in the doctors name and allegedly began selling fraudulent prescriptions for oxycodone without the doctors knowledge or consent. According to court documents, the conspirators also issued prescriptions and submitted bogus billings in the name of a doctor who at the time was hospitalized and later died. For the sake of mere profit, the operators of these medical clinics spewed deadly prescription drugs onto our streets, said Christian J. Schrank, special agent in charge for the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The opioid epidemic gripping this country is well documented and our communities in the Los Angeles area have been impacted, he said. Too often those ill-gotten gains came at the expense of innocent Americans. The indictment also charges Matosyan and others -- including defense attorney Fred Minassian -- with obstruction of justice for allegedly creating fraudulent medical records in an effort to deter the investigation. After a load of Vicodin was seized from one of the conspiracys major customers, Matosyan allegedly oversaw the creation of fake medical paperwork in an effort to make it appear the drugs had been legitimately prescribed. The indictment describes intercepted conversations in which the lawyer allegedly strategized on how to deceive law enforcement, which included a plan to bribe a doctor to lie to authorities. A woman who answered the telephone at Minassians office said nobody was immediately available to comment on the allegations against the lawyer. The 12 defendants arrested Thursday are: -- Matosyan, 36, of Encino, who is accused of leading the scheme by recruiting corrupt doctors, overseeing the theft of other doctors identities, and negotiating the sale of fraudulent prescriptions and narcotic pills; -- Armen Simonyan, 52, of Burbank, who allegedly managed the operations at some of the fraudulent clinics; -- Grisha Sayadyan, 66, of Burbank, who allegedly managed the operations at various clinics and sold oxycodone and Vicodin pills directly to black market customers; -- Sabrina Guberman, 45, of Encino, who, while working at the sham clinics, allegedly lied to pharmacies seeking to verify the fraudulent narcotic prescriptions, which included creating and sending fake medical paperwork; -- Frederick Manning Jr., 47, of Santa Ana, allegedly one of the major drug customers of the clinics, who is charged with agreeing to purchase as many as 1,000 pills per week of narcotics from Matosyan; -- Minassian, 50, of Glendale, the attorney who allegedly spearheaded the scheme to lie to law enforcement by making it falsely appear that Vicodin seized from Frederick Manning Jr. had been legitimately prescribed by a doctor; -- Ralph Manning, 49, of North Hills -- no relation to Frederick Manning Jr. -- who is charged with being one of the principal couriers Matosyan used to deliver fraudulent prescriptions and quantities of narcotic pills; -- Hayk Matosyan, 30, of Granada Hills, Matosyans brother, who allegedly filled fraudulent narcotic prescriptions at pharmacies and sold the resulting narcotics pills to black-market customers; -- Marisa Montenegro, 54, of West Hills, who allegedly filled fraudulent prescriptions; -- Elizabeth Gurumdzhyan, 25, of Hollywood, who allegedly filled fraudulent prescriptons; -- Anait Guyumzhyan, 27, of Hollywood, who allegedly filled prescriptions for oxycodone and returned the drugs to Matosyan-operated clinics in exchange for cash payment; and -- James Wilson, 54, of Venice, who alone is charged in the second indictment with illegally selling oxycodone prescriptions out of a Long Beach clinic that he controlled. The dozen defendants were expected to be arraigned on the indictment Thursday afternoon in Los Angeles federal court. Authorities are continuing to seek two named defendants: Gary Henderson, 62, of Lancaster, who allegedly purchased fraudulent oxycodone prescriptions from Matosyan; and an unidentified conspirator known only by the name Cindy. All of the defendants face significant terms in federal prison if they are convicted. For example, if convicted of the nine counts in which he is charged, Matosyan would face up to 165 years in prison, prosecutors noted. City News Service; Photo: Shutterstock",0

"NORWALK, OH — Creepy clowns have arrived in Ohio, or at least weird reports of them have. Residents in Norwalk reported several incidents involving people dressed as clowns harassing pedestrians last week, sending police officers there on a wild goose chase throughout the city. After a night of chasing clowns, however, police concluded that the whole affair had been a prank that got out of hand. Someone posted a photo of two clowns on Facebook, and that post was shared more than 1,000 times. Then the calls started coming in. Police concluded that many of the reports had been exaggerated, potentially deliberately, and located two suspects, one of whom just wanted to get famous. Officers also said they were going to review recorded incident calls to try and identify voices and ensure each report wasnt part of a larger prank. The calls started on the night of Sept. 22 when Norwalk police began receiving reports of four men, dressed like clowns, riding bicycles and harassing pedestrians on Cline Street. When police arrived on the scene, there were no clowns. They were, however, approached by a resident wanting to make another complaint about the clowns. At 12:20 a.m., police received a call saying there were clowns loitering in the woods behind H&B Hop, an ice cream parlor at 296 W. Main St. The clowns were allegedly jumping out of the woods and attempting to scare people walking by. At 1:43 a.m., a resident on Concord Court complained that she had seen a clown attempting to break into her house. Neighbors of the resident said they had been outside and hadnt seen any suspicious activity. As the night continued to get stranger, callers began complaining that a motorcycle group was allegedly hunting for the clowns as well. However, officers only located three individuals sitting in a parked car on Glover Avenue. They said they had located the clowns on Facebook and that one of the clowns had taken a selfie at Norwalk Recreation Center. Police told the three people to go home. Using Facebook photos posted by the suspects, officers were eventually able to track down the residence of one of the clowns. The suspect spoke to police the day after the incidents. He initially denied taking part in the pranks, said he was falsely accused on social media, and repeatedly asked officers if he could work as an undercover agent. Eventually, he admitted that he and his girlfriend dressed up as clowns but said he only walked outside of his residence. He said he got the idea from a video they saw on the internet and that he had no intention of scaring anyone. However, the suspects girlfriend posted a picture of the duo dressed as clowns and claimed to have spotted them on the way back from a restaurant. When the photo went viral, her boyfriend begged her to take it down, but she didnt. He claimed she wanted to be famous. Police now believe that many people who posted on Facebook claiming to have seen the clowns were merely re-posting screen shots and claiming to have seen the clowns roaming throughout town. Wellington Police, though denying having made a post about the clown incident, did paste a warning to potential clowners on their Facebook page. Wellington is about 30 minutes from Norwalk. This Ohio incident follows a wave of clown-based crimes and reports in the south. Most recently, an Alabama man was arrested after he approached shoppers at a Georgia Walmart dressed like a clown. That incident followed a wave of reported clown sightings that swept through Georgia after first popping up in North Carolina and South Carolina in the past months. Image via Pixabay",0

"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton discussed her commitment to the middle class at three Los Angeles-area fundraisers today amid criticism from both the Republican National Committee and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The fundraisers were closed to reporters, like most fundraisers for presidential candidates. An aide who asked not to be identified said Clinton discussed her commitment to build on the progress made under President Barack Obama, her fights to break down the barriers holding people back, including any American who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, sexism and discrimination against the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. The Republican National Committee released a web video of comments made in 2008 by Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, critical of Obama, who she was running against for the Democratic presidential nomination, and slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. The video ends with a picture of the Clintons accompanied by the words, The Clintons: Only with you, when they need you. A tweet from campaign account of Sanders, who is running against Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, noted its been 17 days, 16 hours and 32 minutes since @HillaryClinton said she would look into releasing her paid speeches to Wall Street. There was no immediate response from the Clinton campaign to the video and tweet. Clinton began her seventh visit to Southern California since declaring her candidacy with a $1,000 per-person fundraiser at the Studio City home of Elizabeth Hirsh Naftali where individuals donating $2,700 had a photo taken with Clinton. Individuals raising $10,000 or couples contributing $5,400 to Clintons primary campaign had photos taken with the former first lady and became members of the Hillary for America Finance Committee, according to an invitation obtained by City News Service. The maximum individual contribution under federal law for a candidate seeking a partys presidential nomination is $2,700. The 68-year-old Clinton then attended a $2,700-per-person fundraiser at the SLS Hotel on Los Angeles-Beverly Hills border. Clintons final event was an evening reception in Hancock Park. Individuals raising $10,000 were co-hosts of the event and had a photo taken with Clinton. Individuals raising $27,000 had photos taken with Clinton, received a ticket to a host reception and became members of the Hillary for America Finance Committee. The fundraiser was held at the home of Jon Vein, the chief strategy officer and a co-founder of MarketShare, which describes itself as the worlds leading analytics technology provider for major brand marketers, and his wife, Ellen Goldsmith-Vein, a movie producer. Approximately 320 people attended the Studio City fundraiser while the SLS Hotel event drew approximately 175 people. Mayor Eric Garcetti was among the approximately 300 people at the Hancock Park event. The Southland fundraisers are part of a two-day California fundraising swing for Clinton, which began Sunday with three events in Northern California, according to the website politicalpartytime.org, which tracks political fundraisers. Clinton held 17 fundraisers during her previous visits to the Southland since declaring her candidacy on April 12. Clinton also participated in a roundtable discussion with a group of home care providers, appeared on the ABC late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live and helped introduce the Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders for Hillary initiative in her past Southland visits during this campaign cycle.

"Updated 11:46 a.m. Wednesday Continuing an approval streak that began in 1980, San Marino voters approved the public safety tax extension Tuesday that needed two-thirds of the vote to pass.  The tax funds almost a third of department, and paramedics services and city officials have put certain things on hold, depending on the outcome of the public safety tax vote. I never take a parcel tax for granted, San Marino City Manager Matt Ballantyne told Patch Wenesday. I was relatively optimistic but I felt like I guess we were kind of in a holding pattern because we had some significant financial consequences if it didnt pass. So I guess now Im excited about being able to move forward. San Marino delayed and also put off . Fire Chief Priority The main priority is the fire chief position so were starting that process to appoint somebody by January first, said Ballantyne, adding that the approval of Measure S directly correlated with the hiring of a new fire chief, per a plan the city put together around June. The city is looking at two internal candidates for the fire chief position—SMFD Division Chiefs and , who have been splitting fire chief duties along with since s official retirement in June. A new fire chiefs salary will be in the range of $145,032-$181,284, according to San Marino Finance Director Lisa Bailey. Ballantyne said he is not in a rush to hire a new police lieutenant and that adjustment may correlate more with when Chief Schaefer looks to retire, but the city is still discussing plans for the position and will need to consult the management team and . City Hall Renovations City officials have also spoken about being dependent on the outcome of the vote, since even though the public safety tax funds only police, fire and paramedics, city funds would be considerably tighter if the tax did not pass. The proposed renovations are not up for further immediate city council discussion, but Ballantyne said they will likely be considered in coming months. Typically around January or February we do a mid-year review to see if we are hitting our targets and at that point in time well probably be discussing capital projects that have been placed on hold, one of which would probably be City Hall, but its up to the council, said Ballantyne. No other city projects or hirings are currently in discussions as a result of the public safety tax approval, said Ballantyne, who stressed that if Measure S had failed, the outcome would be much more difficult and result in a loss of city employee positions, so he is really thankful for the people that have been involved in promoting it. How do you feel about the public safety tax approval? What is your priority now that its been approved--fire chief, police lieutenant or City Hall renovations? Tell us in the comment box below.",0

">>News Alerts: Subscribe to a free email newsletter: ANNAPOLIS •EDGEWATER •ODENTON ODENTON, MD — An Odenton contractor who stole and pawned valuable family heirlooms from a customer he threatened, and tried to forge her checks, has been sentenced to 25 years in prison. Jason Tyler Butler was sentenced Tuesday on charges including issuing false documentation, felony theft, and second-degree burglary. A judge also ordered Butler to pay restitution and refused to consider modifying two sentences, one for a period of ten years and the other of 15 years, which he was originally ordered to serve concurrently. Prosecutors say Butler was hired by Leigh Lawson of Odenton to do work on her home. Over about seven months, Butler stole and pawned tens of thousands of dollars worth of Lawsons family heirlooms, which included her grandmothers engagement ring and her fathers wedding band and class ring. Butler also stole checks from Lawson and tried to forge her signature to cash the checks. Butler sold Lawsons property valued at $29,950. The victim told prosecutors that she feared for her well-being, especially when Butler was abusing drugs. Anne Arundel County States Attorney Wes Adams said Wednesday that Butler has continuously violated court orders with seven violations of probation. For 17 years, Mr. Butler has skirted accountability in our criminal justice system, Adams said. Mr. Butler is an example of an everyday criminal who revolves through the court system and threatens the quality of life for our citizens. Lawson thanked Adams office in a statement: I am relieved. I can carry on finally with my life without having to be scared and victimized. I can carry on with my work, my life, and can focus again. The States Attorneys Office is incredibly compassionate, understanding, and eloquent with their words in court - not just that but their professionalism and deep knowledge of the law. … I was embarrassed to even talk about it, but if anyone out there is a victim, they should come forward. Wes Adams office made sure I was comforted along the way. In a second case, Butler stole about $3,000 worth of copper wiring and other items -- including a bathtub, a furnace and a radiator -- from an unoccupied residence in Crownsville.",0

"A Montgomery County police officer faces 25 years in prison on charges of fraud and lying in testimony during a workers compensation claim. Gilbert L. Payne, who left the Baltimore City Police Department on a full disability pension in 2007, has been charged in Baltimore City Circuit Court with perjury and felony workers compensation fraud, according to the Office of the State Prosecutor. Authorities allege that Payne falsely testified under oath at a September 2008 workers compensation hearing that he was not employed at the time, nor had he been employed since retiring from the Baltimore City Police Department. In fact, Payne was then employed full time as a Towson University police officer. The charging document alleges that as a result of the fraud, Payne received about $30,000 in payments to which he was not entitled. State Prosecutor Emmet C. Davitt said in the release, Testifying falsely under oath and making false statements in order to fraudulently obtain additional workers compensation funds is never acceptable. It is particularly egregious, however, when such acts are committed by a police officer sworn to uphold the law. A trial date has not been set. The perjury charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years. The fraud charge carries a maximum sentence of 15 years and a fine of $15,000.  Payne was hired by the Montgomery County Police Department on July 12, 2010, and is on administrative leave pending the outcome of the trial and administrative investigation, the department says.",0

"STAFFORD, VA — An older man was allegedly held hostage and assaulted at his home for five days, while forced to use his ATM card to get money and make big-ticket credit card purchases, according to the Stafford County Sheriffs Office. The two suspects were arrested after a bank employee tipped investigators off on Thursday. Jamhal Blanks, 28, of Windsor Road in Stafford, and Brianna Archie, 18, of Dillwyn Court in Woodbridge, were charged with extortion by threat and abduction to extort money. Shortly before 9 a.m., deputies received a call from an employee at the BB&T bank at 760 Warrenton Road. The worker said a female witness outside in the parking lot near the ATM told her the victim made some sort of indication he was being robbed, after which she saw the victim leave in a car with a younger male and she wrote down the vehicles license plate number. That led to police to Cynthias Place, where the vehicle was registered. Police say they knocked on the door and were greeted by a disheveled and quite nervous older man. He then stepped outside and told them of his ordeal — and that his alleged abductors were still inside. The victim was treated for broken bones and lacerations, according to a sheriffs office statement. Photos: Stafford County Sheriffs Office",0

"JOLIET, IL - Aaron Scofield was born and raised in Joliet. He graduated from Joliet West in 2005, later he attended Joliet Junior College. He liked his job as a warehouse technician for the Amazon facility in Joliet off Briggs Street. During the overnight hours of Thursday, Jan. 18, he finished early. Scofield drove from Amazon to the Walmart on Jefferson Street to buy groceries. Around 3:45 a.m., he pumped gas for his 2011 KIA Soul at the nearby Thorntons station. Then he got back on Interstate 80 at Larkin Avenue. He crossed the Des Plaines River and continued east on I-80 back toward his home in Chicago. Around 4 a.m. a terrible tragedy unfolded and I-80 eastbound was closed down for about four hours that morning. Illinois State Police rushed the scene near I-80 and Interstate 355. The 31-year-old Joliet man was taken away by ambulance and pronounced dead at Silver Cross Hospital.  Several hours later, State Police announced that Scofields car was struck by a Joliet motorist, Randy Mahoney, 43. Police said that Mahoneys vehicle swerved to avoid the 2011 KIA Soul that was stationary in the center lane. The KIA was facing in a northeasterly direction. Over the past three months, the I-80 fatality investigation has changed dramatically. Illinois State Police told Joliet Patch on Wednesday they are now trying to find a hit-and-run semi driver. It turns out that Scofields KIA was struck twice that morning; first by the hit-and-run motorist who caused the Joliet natives KIA to be rendered disabled. It was the semi collision that precipitated Scofield later being struck by the other car. The second crash involving Mahoney was responsible for the fatality. The crash reconstruction unit for the Illinois State Police told Patch they found brake marks at the scene of the fatality; these were attributed to the hit-and-run semi that kept on going. Damage from their collision was discovered on the passenger side of Scofields KIA, the State Police told Patch this week. For reasons unknown to this day, the semi driver chose not to stop. He or she kept driving east on I-80, state police said.  That vehicle knew that he made contact, Illinois State Police re-constructionist Dave Verkler told Joliet Patch on Wednesday. It was some type of commercial motor vehicle. But we have no specifics as far as color of the vehicle. The hit-and-run truck was likely a semi-tractor, Verkler said. That truck would have had damage points on the drivers side, or left side, of the commercial rig, he added. At least four motorists stopped to render aid to Scofield after they came upon the secondary collision with Mahoneys 2005 Toyota 4Runner in New Lenox Township. However, these witnesses left once the fire trucks and ambulances arrived at the scene. Now, Scofields family is hoping that someone will come forward now that they realize that the semi-trailer that caused the chain reaction crash has evaded the police. We believe that someone, possibly one of the people who stopped to help, may have seen the truck or possibly even saw it happen. We need those witnesses to contact the ... District 5 State Police Investigation Team Jim and Linda Brodnicki wrote to Patch. (Linda Brodnicki is the victims mother.) Someone had to have seen the truck either hitting Aarons car or leaving the scene, possibly both, they added. Verkler urges any witnesses to call State Police District 5 Lockport headquarters at 815-726-6377. According to Verkler, the commercial semi-trailer may have been headed toward Route 45 (LaGrange Road) or to Interstate 57. A third possibility was the Indiana Toll Road. The hit-and-run semi-tractor driver may be someone who travels I-80 regularly, he noted. Verkler said State Police searched the fatality scene for debris that may have fallen off the damaged semi but we came up with nothing. Verkler has investigated numerous fatalities for the State Police. Its his expertise. Patch asked him about the chances of finding the hit-and-run semi driver, given the passage of time. Theyre difficult, but not impossible, especially with the help of the public, he said confidently. The key is getting some assistance in identifying the vehicle that left the scene.

"Detroit firefighters got a kick in their turnout pants this weekend while fighting a fire in an area that has seen almost a dozen fires in a three-day period. Someone stole important firefighting equipment – a pair of saws valued at about $2,000 each – while the firefighters from Ladder Company 22 were battling the blaze, the Detroit Free Press reports. Firefighters use a chainsaw to breach the roofs of buildings to allow hot air and superheated gases to escape. The larger saw, known as a K-14, is used to cut open metal doors often found on commercial buildings. We parked the rig and fought the fire, Firefighter Jeremy Mullins told the Free Press. When we came back and opened the compartment, they were gone. ... It was easy pickings. Its very frustrating. Ive put in a lot of effort to get things like that for my firehouse and other firehouses to make sure they have what they need. To have them stolen, its a slap in the face. Its not the first time such a theft has occurred, according to a story on the Detroit Fire Departments legacy website. A similar theft occurred in January 2013. Firefighters had left the firehouse at 6830 McGraw briefly to grab a bite to eat at a nearby restaurant. When they returned, the chainsaw and K-12 saw were missing. The K-12 was recovered at a local flea market, but the chainsaw was never found. It was later replaced through a donation by the National Firefighters Endowment. After the first theft, Ladder Company 22 firefighters chained the saws together, then attached the chain to the inside of the truck. But firefighters were using a temporary replacement vehicle because the ladder truck was out of service, and they hadnt secured the saws.

"The trial began on Jan.6 after more than two years of delays, which D.C. Superior Court Judge Russell Canan said Muth deliberately caused to avoid trial. Muth has purposely fasted on and off, forcing his hospitalization. Mr. Muths absence here is of his own making, Canan said during a Jan.7 trial session. Muth watched and listened to the trial from his hospital bed using videoconferencing technology. According to the Washington Post, Muth was asked if he wanted to testify via videoconference on Tuesday but refused. Muth, looking thin and frail with his hands folded on his stomach and a sheet pulled up to his chest and handcuffs on the bed rail next to him, said he did not want to testify, the article said. Read full coverage by the Washington Post here. At the start of the trial on Jan. 7, prosecutor Glenn Kirschner said that Muth had a history of abusing Drath and pointed to several instances of domestic violence, including a 1992 court conviction that Muth had beaten Drath, blackening her eyes. This homicide… this murder was a long time coming, Kirschner said. Kirschner also pointed to Muths drunken state the night of Draths murder, signs that Drath had been dragged to the bathroom where she was found dead, Google searches by Muth on the night of Draths death for extradition to Mexico, flights to Iceland and crossing the Canadian border, and an allegedly phony modification to Draths will. Muths attorney Craig Hickein said that Kirschners claims were simply a theory and that his material was not evidence that Muth was involved with Draths death. Hickein pointed to a lack of DNA evidence and Muths cooperation with police. Albrecht Muth didnt hide; he didnt flee; he didnt need to, Hickein said. If convicted of Draths first-degree murder, Muth faces life in prison. Check back here for updates on the lawyers closing statements and the jury decision.",0

"Footage of looters and fire burning in Baltimore Monday night sparked some thoughtful comments, and pleas for peace, from some celebrities.  Writer David Simon, who covered the police beat as a newspaper reporter in Baltimore and used that as creative grist for the HBO drama The Wire, blogged about the riots. He chided the rioters who filled the streets on the day of Freddie Grays funeral, even as the Gray family asked for peaceful protest.  Simon wrote, in part, But now — in this moment — the anger and the selfishness and the brutality of those claiming the right to violence in Freddie Grays name needs to cease. There was real power and potential in the peaceful protests that spoke in Mr. Grays name initially, and there was real unity at his homegoing today. But this, now, in the streets, is an affront to that mans memory and a dimunition of the absolute moral lesson that underlies his unnecessary death. If you cant seek redress and demand reform without a brick in your hand, you risk losing this moment for all of us in Baltimore. Turn around. Go home. Please, Simon wrote. Baltimore Ravens star, and now ESPN football analyst Ray Lewis took to Twitter to share his dismay at the violence.  Violence is not the answer. We must have peace in our city, we are a city thats built on  believing in each other, Lewis tweeted. We must come together, we can stop the violence as a community. These kids have to have real leaders, we need everybody to join this movement.  Rapper Freddie Gibbs said via Twitter: If u lootin, u takin advantage of The Gray family and their loss, using it as excuse to be a thief during a riot. Quite cowardly of u.

"BRICK, NJ -- (Updated, 1:45 p.m.) Authorities are seeking the publics help and information in connection with the skull found Tuesday in the Lake Riviera section of Brick Township. Al Della Fave, spokesman for the Ocean County Prosecutors office, said the skull was discovered about 3 p.m. on Tuesday, confirming information that was given to the Brick Patch by a resident who lives in the part of Lake Riviera where the skull was found. Della Fave supplied photos of the skull. The skull was lying just off the road at the edge of a wooded area in the area of Arizona Drive and Old Toms River Road, according to a photo supplied by the resident. Old Toms River Road/Arizona Drive was closed Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday between Beaverson Boulevard and Emerald Drive while authorities searched the woods for anything related to the skull, Brick police said. An initial statement referred to it as a head, but was later clarified as a skull. For years, kids who lived in Lake Riviera rode bicycles in those wooded areas that border Old Toms River Road and behind homes that sit on Arizona Drive, cutting through those woods on their way to Lake Riviera Middle School, which is across Beaverson Boulevard. Old Toms River Road intersects with Beaverson Boulevard at the bend where Beaverson becomes Shorrock Street; once an almost 90-degree turn, the road was reconfigured and the angle widened and a traffic signal was installed at the Old Toms River Road-Beaverson intersection. As of this school year, however, students are no longer permitted to ride bicycles to the middle school because of the volume of traffic along Beaverson, which becomes Shorrock as it turns the corner right near where the search is being conducted. That increased traffic is due in part to the fact that Shorrock now connects directly to the Garden State Parkway at the western end of the road, where it crosses Route 70 by Home Depot. Another resident said there were rumors that a homeless man had been living in one of the wooded spots. Anyone with information regarding this investigation should call the Brick Township Police Department at 732-262-1143 or the Ocean County Prosecutors Office at 732-929-2027.

"NEW YORK, NY — The NYPDs civilian oversight board may start investigating complaints of sexual misconduct by cops, making it the first such body in the nation to do so. The Civilian Complaint Review Board will vote at a Wednesday meeting on a resolution that would empower it to investigate and administratively prosecute accusations of sexual harassment, rape and other misdeeds that the NYPDs Internal Affairs Bureau currently handles. If the boards 10 sitting members approve the resolution, it would immediately start investigating complaints of non-criminal sexual misconduct by cops, such as catcalling, taking photos during strip searches or other lewd behavior, according to a CCRB memo. The boards staff would also develop a plan to probe more serious allegations such as sexual assault and rape, which would require specially trained investigators, the memo says. In the meantime, the CCRB would continue referring those complaints to the Internal Affairs Bureau and to local district attorneys offices for possible criminal prosecution. The move would expand the CCRBs purview and take administrative investigations of sexual misconduct by cops outside the Police Department. Every act of professional misconduct tends to chip away at the publics trust in its law enforcement officers and, more broadly, in the institution of policing, the CCRB memo says. Perhaps no abuse of authority, however, undermines societys confidence in the police more than an officer who wields the badge as a tool of sexual intimidation and coercion. In addition to rape and sexual assault, the memo says, the board would investigate any complaints of cops having sex on duty, even if it was purportedly consensual. NYPD policy prohibits sex on duty, but the City Council and state Legislature are trying to explicitly outlaw it, citing unbalanced power dynamics between cops and civilians. The CCRB says it would be the first civilian police oversight body in the U.S. to have jurisdiction over sexual complaints. The board can recommend disciplinary charges against officers and prosecute them at administrative trials overseen by the NYPD. The CCRB got 117 complaints of sexual misconduct by cops from January 2016 to June 2017, ranging from catcalls to unwanted touching and rape, the memo says. The board referred all those complaints to the Internal Affairs Bureau, which handles internal NYPD investigations of wrongdoing by cops. The CCRB now wants to fold sexual misconduct into its current jurisdiction, which includes allegations of force, abuse of authority, discourtesy and use of offensive language. (S)exual misconduct by a police officer is, at its core, an abuse of authority, the CCRB memo says. Patch has reached out to the NYPD for comment. Well update this story if we hear back. Wednesdays vote will come as two former NYPD cops, Richard Hall and Eddie Martins, face criminal charges for allegedly raping a teen they had handcuffed in Brooklyn in September. Both have reportedly claimed the sex was consensual. It also comes as lawmakers across the nation try to clamp down on sexual harassment and assault as part of the global #MeToo movement. Michael David, an attorney for the woman Hall and Martins are accused of raping, said he welcomes the idea of another agency tackling sexual misconduct by cops. But his experience with the CCRB leads him to believe it isnt aggressive enough in sanctioning officers for wrongdoing, he said. Any other agency that would investigate police misconduct is obviously going be helpful, but personally I dont have confidence in them, David said.

"WORCESTER, MA—A Worcester man was indicted on Thursday in federal court in Worcester on a federal firearms charge. Steven Rivera, 24, was charged with being a felon in possession of ammunition. Rivera was arrested on June 29, 2017, as part of a coordinated federal and state sweep that resulted in the arrests of eight others who have been charged with firearms-related offenses, said the U.S. Attorney-District of Massachusetts. The DA said that according to court documents, Rivera – who has multiple prior felony convictions, including drug-related offenses – sold two handguns and numerous rounds of ammunition to a person in Worcester on Feb. 14, 2017. On Feb. 28, 2017, Rivera sold that same recipient two more handguns and numerous rounds of ammunition, and during a recorded phone call, Rivera offered to sell that person heroin, as well. Eight others were arrested on state charges as part of an investigation into gun and narcotics trafficking in the Worcester area. During the course of the investigation, law enforcement purchased nine guns from nine defendants, including several handguns, two shotguns, and an assault rifle with a 100-round capacity drum magazine; multiple rounds of ammunition; and narcotics.

"CRANE, OR — A two-car crash in rural Harney County Monday morning reportedly killed all eight people involved, Oregon State Police said Tuesday. Police on Wednesday released the identities of those killed. Prairie City resident Mark Robert Rundell, 48, was reportedly driving the 1999 Toyota 4-Runner that collided head-on with the 2016 Toyota 4-Runner driven by Tacoma, Washington, resident Erika Carter Boquet, 29. In the 4-Runner with Boquet were her children, Isabella Earlene, 11, Elisabeth Ann, 8, and Tytis Michael, 6, as well as her friend Kyla Marie Brown, 28, of Olympia, Washington, and Browns children Arianna Marie, 10, and Xavier King Johnson, 2. According to friends, Boquet and Brown were heading to Las Vegas for an end-of-summer trip. A GoFundMe campaign was initiated to help Boquets family return their bodies to Washington and to pay for funeral expenses. Created on Tuesday, the campaign by Wednesday morning had exceeded its goal of $10,000 — with more than 460 people donating nearly $23,000. Oregon State Police troopers were dispatched around 10 a.m. Aug. 13 to the two-vehicle collision on Highway 78 near milepost 30, just south of Crane.

"The victim in an armed robbery that occurred Thursday morning on E. Myrtle Street was also sexually assaulted, according to police. Mark Bergin of the Alexandria Police Department said at 10 a.m. a man wearing a mask covering his nose to his chin approached a 30-year-old woman while she was parking her van in the unit block of E. Myrtle Street near its intersection with Braddock Road. The suspect showed the woman a black, semiautomatic pistol and demanded money. He then asked the woman to step out of the vehicle. The two met at the front of the van and the suspect put his arm around the woman, who handed him her cash. She was touched inappropriately, which is considered sexual battery, Bergin said. The suspect walked away and the woman drove off and called the police. A Myrtle Street resident who asked not to be named said she was told the victim was a nanny dropping a child off for piano lessons in a home on the block. Bergin said police believe Thursdays incident is unrelated to a robbery that occurred Monday where resident Marquita Thompson and her fiancé, Miguel Crouch, were held up at gunpoint near the intersections E. Howell and Leslie avenues. The assault component is very different, Bergin said. The suspects in each incident have been described differently, Bergin said. The suspect in Thursdays robbery and assault is described as a tall, black male with dark skin and a medium to heavy build. He was wearing a half-mask and a green reflective vest under a black hooded jacket, Bergin said. The suspect in Mondays armed robbery is described as a slender, light-skinned black male with remarkable freckles, Bergin said.

"Vacant lots, foreclosures, and blighted properties continue to be an eyesore for neighborhoods in southwest Atlanta and throughout Atlanta.  The City of East Point continues to take a stand against these properties and delinquent owners by demolishing blighted eyesores. East Points 50 Worst Properties Program is a compilation of 50 properties from each of the four Wards in the City that violate Fire Codes due to being a clear threat to human life, safety and/or health. Abandoned properties often are sought by vagrants to stay warm, and can be a haven for fires or a cesspool for crimes, says Fire Chief Rosemary R. Cloud.  The 50 Worst Properties Program provides an avenue to help ensure that neighborhoods remain safe from fire and crime, states the Fire Chief. The 50 Worst Properties Task Force has scheduled its next demolition of a home located at 1316 Walker Avenue for Saturday, May 18, 2013 at 8:00 A.M.. According to the fire department, the property was taken through a detailed process before reaching this last and final stage of a Municipal Court ordered demolition. This is the 3rd property demolition scheduled by the Task Force.  The Los Erken Apartments located on Central Avenue in East Point became the first property to be demolished in May of last year, followed by a Duplex on Lyle Avenue in October 2012.  This third demolition comes as the Task Force continues working to exhaust a 50 Worst Properties Phase II list, which was created after properties on the original list became compliant. According to a written statement by the East Point Fire Department, once a property is listed, it goes through a detailed process of 8 to 15 steps which includes, but is not limited to an inspection(s), locating and notifying the property owner, awaiting a response, and the issuance of a citation.  If the property owner does not respond, the property is then moved through a court process. The Task Force says additional demolitions can be expected.  How many blighted properties are in your neighborhood?  Do you want them demolished, or is there another idea?

"AZUSA, CA - The charred remains of two people whose bodies were found atop a hill in a recently burned area of Angeles National Forest near Azusa were hoisted from the scene Friday, a day after a man found them while searching for his missing brother and cousin. It has not been confirmed that the bodies are those of Jonathan Pardo, 16, and his 31-year-old cousin, Carlos Perez. The two went missing after setting out on a hike just hours before the Reservoir Fire broke out on June 20, according to Jonathans older brother, Ricardo, who said he and family members made the grisly find. Firefighters were called about 2:20 p.m. Thursday to a scorched area along North San Gabriel Canyon Road, near Morris Dam above Azusa, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department. But the bodies were not immediately located. Members of the San Dimas Mountain Rescue Team, however, eventually reached the remains, which were significantly impacted by the effects of the fire, according to Los Angeles County sheriffs Deputy Trina Schrader. The terrain that theyre in, if that is them, theres no way to outrun a fire because they were uphill from the fire, Sheriffs Homicide Bureau Lt. Mike Rosson said today. Ricardo Pardo told reporters that he, along with family members and friends, had been searching for his brother and cousin ever since and faulted authorities for not treating the case more urgently. Me and my family members found the bodies, he told the Los Angeles Times. Its sad that police officers want credit when they didnt want to help at all. According Rosson, the actions taken by authorities upon learning of the missing were appropriate. The Reservoir merged with another blaze, the Fish Fire, to become the San Gabriel Complex Fire. — City News Service, photo courtesy of the LASD",0

It all happened after a fiery crash at Dougherty Ferry and Carman roads. (The rescue, crash scene and events that unfolded afterward were all caught on the police dash cam video in this article.) Monday, Gonzalez, a 16-year veteran of law enforcement, was honored for heroism, while Caruso, whose 15-year-old daughter was with him at the time of the crash, received an honor for citizen bravery. Both men tell Patch they do not consider themselves the heroes that many residents have called them since that night. Training took over and thats why I did what I did, Gonzalez tells Patch. He said he did not expect a proclamation of heroism for his efforts. I was overwhelmed. As long as Caruso was awarded, thats all I care about. Caruso, a CBC graduate, also tells Patch he never expected such attention for his actions. Very strange when I saw my picture on the news, Caruso said. I obviously dont think of myself like that. Im just a normal dad, a normal husband. Im fortunate that everything worked out all right. A sentiment that is shared by their familys, especially both wives, that say they are so proud of their husbands, but think about that night and how it could have ended differently. I didnt know what emotion I was feeling. I was scared, I was sad. The next day I was mad, Gonzalezs wife Tammy explained. My initial reaction was my heart just sank, Bridget Caruso said when she learned of the incident. Our whole family was kind of in shock that night. It was very surreal. And every day it sank in, and sank in, how our lives could have changed that night. In fact, Caruso and his daughter were at the scene when the crash happened and narrowly missed being struck by the Chevrolet Tahoe that had already caught fire. His daughter tells Patch she told her dad not to go to the burning vehicles. However, with no one else there yet, Caruso went to the cars, first helping the female driver who was trapped inside a Chevrolet Blazer engulfed in flames, then helping Gonzalez save the Tahoe driver. Very proud. Just the bravery, Bridget Caruso tells Patch of her husbands actions. Gonzalezs wife Tammy said the same. Although such a situation is unsettling, shes nothing but proud of her husband. So honored to be his wife, she tells Patch. Download the movie",0

"SOUTH BRUNSWICK, NJ — The motel fire that heavily damaged the Best Western on Rt. 1 Sunday night and sent two firefighters to the hospital for heat exhaustion was caused by a refrigerator coil that overheated, South Brunswick police said. The coil then caused the carpet to catch fire. A guest staying at the Best Western Princeton Manor Inn & Suites at 4191 Rt. 1 first noticed the fire in his room at 7:23 p.m. Sunday.

"(UPDATED 11:41 a.m.)—Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony W. Batts blamed gangs methods of killing for the spike in the Northern Districts homicides last year. Batts said micro rivalries between the Black Guerilla Family and Blood subset Tree Top Pirus were to blame for many of the murders in the Greenmount Avenue corridor last year. These guys were just assassins. These werent just regular shootings, Batts told members of the York Road Partnership during the groups meeting Wednesday. He recalled a conversation with a University of Maryland R. Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center doctor, who told him that 97 percent of people who make it to that hospital alive leave alive. Well [the gang members] werent allowing these guys to get to shock trauma, Batts said. What they were doing is walking up on each other down the alleys, and coming up close range, and shooting them in the head four or five times—I mean just viciousness. So they were executing each other. They were assassinating each other on both sides. He attributed the increase in homicides citywide in 2012 from the year before—despite the number of overall shootings being drastically down—to the fighting between these gangs. According to Comstat figures, the numbers city police use to track crime, city homicides increased from 197 in 2011 to 217 last year citywide. In the Northern District, the number of homicides surged from 15 in 2011 to 24 last year. Shootings citywide dropped from 379 in 2011 to 372 from the year before. Where as shootings jumped to 35 from 30 between 2011 and 2012 in the Northern District. Batts said because its taking police too long to put together the connections between murders, he wants to build better intelligence sharing in the department. I wanted us to know [where] these micro rivalries were taking place, Batts said. And I dont expect us to be able to stop shooting number one, because we cant have a police officer on every block at every location in the city. But I definitely wanted us to stop shootings two through 11. So we couldnt afford to have a shooting in July and catch it in October or November. He added that the Northern District had been driving him nuts last year, and that he had called Maj. Sabrina Tapp-Harper, the districts commander, into his office several times about the violence and the response. He said that theyve made several changes, and that theyre starting to see positive results. We sat down and we started putting a lot of different things in place and its working very well in the Northern, Batts said. Greenmount was on fire, it was just on fire. Thats where all these assassinations were taking place. According to Comstat figures updated through March 30, homicides citywide are up 48 from 41 during the same time period last year. While the number of shootings citywide are down to 62 compared to 78 during the same time last year. In the Northern District, there were four homicides compared to two at the same time last year. But shootings are down from eight at the same point in 2012 to three this year. Batts argued that increase in homicides in the district can be blamed primarily on domestic disputes, such as a murder-suicide in Waverly and a shooting death last month in Remington. Batts remarks were part of a larger address to residents about a wide variety of topics, such as making the department more efficient, the medias obsession with homicide numbers and trying to get residents from succeeding neighborhoods to help residents build commmunities in the Western District.

"SOLON, OH - Any way you look at it $400 is a lot of money. For one Solon woman, $400 could be the start of a much more damaging scam. Read on for more information. OVI, Aurora Road: Police arrested Phillip Effler, 29, of Macedonia, after he was seen speeding down SR 91, just north of SR 43. Officers say Effler emanated a strong odor of alcohol when they talked to him. Effler told the officer that he had a concealed carry permit and there was a gun in the car. Field sobriety tests indicated Effler was impaired, so he was arrested and taken to jail. He refused a breath test. He was charged with OVI, Speed, and Improper Handling of a Firearm in a Motor Vehicle. Assault, Nestle Frozen Foods: Nestle was the site of an assault on March 23.

She was also advised to contact Cuyahoga County fraud assistance. OVI, SR 91: Police stopped a man on SR 91 near Carriage Park Drive for a license plate violation. When police spoke with the man, they detected a smell of alcohol and noticed that his eyes were bloodshot and his speech slurred.

"NEW YORK, NY — The New York City Police Department joins residents from across the boroughs in wearing denim on Denim Day NYC, an annual movement supported by a coalition of survivors, advocates, community organizations, city council members and city agencies working together to raise awareness about sexual assault.

"Photo by Travis/Flickr NEW YORK CITY, NY — If you ride your dirt bike or ATV through the streets of New York City, it will be taken away from you and crushed on television, Mayor Bill De Blasio said at a Monday press conference. Both dirt bikes and ATVs are banned in NYC. Even so, some city residents — NYC Police Commissioner Bill Bratton labeled them clowns and knuckleheads at the presser, among other things — drive them around the city each year when the weather warms up, Bratton said, often in large groups. The small vehicles disrupt traffic and make roads and sidewalks less safe, Bratton said, adding that the NYPD attributed three shootings last year to gunmen riding dirt bikes. So, in anticipation of this years riding season, the department is actively searching for and impounding the vehicles, he said. The NYPD has already seized 312 vehicles so far in 2016, according to Chief Carlos Gomez — double their haul during the first quarter of 2015. Unless you want to turn your ATV or dirt bike over to us, dont ride it on NYC streets. #VisionZero #UseItAndLoseIt pic.twitter.com/5wGnMXo4TV To show they mean business, Bratton and De Blasio said the city intends to publicly destroy the vehicles. Were going to crush them on TV to make a point, the mayor said. The NYPD also asked members of the public to help keep dirt bikes and ATVs off the streets by calling 911 when they spot one of the vehicles, either in action or in storage. Another falling soldier.

"By Gregory Kyriakakis State officials are seeking to revoke an area physicians ability to prescribe drugs after he pleaded guilty in New York to conspiring to sell steroids. The state Attorney Generals Office announced Monday that it is taking action against five New Jersey doctors, including Richard Lucente who practiced in Middletown and Staten Island. Lucente entered a guilty plea in 2010 after authorities charged he conspired to illegally sell anabolic steroids and testosterone to patients in New York, taking kickbacks from a Brooklyn pharmacy when the prescriptions were filled there, according to the Attorney Generals Office. Doctors who make the decision to sell [controlled dangerous substance] prescriptions are a disgrace [to] their profession and their violated oath to do no harm, Acting Attorney General John J. Hoffman said in a statement. Authorities said this activity occurred between December 2004 and September 2007. Lucente was sentenced to five years probation and 200 hours of community service. The New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners revoked Lucentes license to practice in 2010, two months after his guilty plea. One patient, a New York bodybuilder, was given steroids and growth hormone despite having undergone a heart transplant, according to NJ.com. That man later died of heart failure following surgery, and New York medical officials said the drugs likely played a role. New Jersey is fighting back against prescribers who contribute to Americas drug epidemic, and working to protect the public should they ever again be reinstated to practice medicine in our state, Hoffman said. The revocation of a CDS registration is an extra layer of protection to the public, according to the Attorney Generals Office, since a doctor who has a license to practice restored still must ask the state Board of Medical Examiners to reinstate the registration. Lucente and the other doctors have been issued Orders to Show Cause why their CDS registrations should not be revoked, with hearing dates in about 45 days from now, according to the Attorney Generals Office. Prior to that, the doctors must explain in writing why they should be able to keep that privilege.",0
"A Shakopee woman has been charged with leading police on a high-speed chase through a residential area in Eden Prairie. My Thi Do, 20, is charged with fleeing a peace officer in a motor vehicle, a felony with a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $5,000 fine. Eden Prairie police were on patrol on Preserve Boulevard near Westwind Drive just before 7:30 p.m. Jan. 1 when they clocked a car driving 50 mph in a 30 mph zone, according to the criminal complaint, signed by Eden Prairie Police Detective Kyle Duchschere. Officers turned on their emergency lights and began to pursue the car. The driver, later identified as Do, didnt stop, even after police flashed a spotlight into her rear window and turned on the siren. Do fled down Anderson Lakes Parkway, reaching speeds of 60 mph in a 30 mph zone, almost colliding with one car and running red lights, according to the complaint. She eventually lost control of the car at the intersection of Bloomington Ferry Road and Pioneer Trail, sliding through the intersection and into a back yard, where she crashed into trees and shrubs, the complaint says. The pursuit went on for almost three miles, police said. Do told officers after her arrest that she knew they were trying to stop her, adding, I dont need this, and I decided just to go, according to the complaint. She admitted that she was trying to get away, the complaint says. Do remains in the Hennepin County Jail on a $20,000 bond. She is scheduled to make a first appearance on the charge today in Hennepin County District Court.",0

"Before the homecoming festivities began at last weekend, students received a sobering reminder about the deadly consequences of making bad choices in their celebrations. An unusually subdued crowd of purple-and-gold-clad students watched as five of their classmates participated in a demonstration of the aftermath of a drunk driving accident. Emergency personnel from the Brentwood and also participated in the mock crash, creating an extremely realistic tableau for the audience of teenagers. Homecoming is a big time of celebration, said Wendy DuCassé, social worker for the Brentwood School District. We just want to bring awareness of alcohol, making good choices, drunk driving, things like that, because we know that the biggest cause of death in this age group is preventable accidents. Creating the 30-minute demonstration took months of work and collaboration between school officials, students, local emergency services and local business Terrys Towing, which provided the two damaged cars. Detective Paul Clayton, the school districts resource officer, helped to coordinate the logistics of the days event by advising the participating students on how to act out their parts. He said he was floored by the quality of the perfomances of the high school actors, expressing special admiration for senior Marion Richter, who portrayed the drunk driver in the accident. She was outstanding, he said, She behaved in exactly the ways that you would see from an intoxicated person. DuCassé said that she hoped that the personal and immediate nature of the demonstration would make it more memorable for Brentwood students as they began their homecoming celebrations. If we can do a scenario like this, where it makes somebody think twice before making a bad choice, then weve done our job, Clayton said. Download the movie",0

"Updated at 7:30 p.m. May 6, 2015: Sheriffs officials confirmedMay 6 that a man serving jail time in San Bernardino for auto theft has been linked by DNA to the December murders of a La Verne businessman and his wife. Luke Fabela, 23, has been behind bars since mid-January, according to the Sheriffs Department. Although DNA has linked him to the Dec. 26 killings of 89-year-old Armie Troy Isom and his 74-year-old wife Shirley, investigators have not determined a motive for the crime, according to the departments Nicole Nishida. Isom and his wife were found by a groundskeeper at their multimillion- dollar home abutting open land in an unincorporated area near La Verne. The woman died from blunt force injuries and her husband died later in the day from being beaten and stabbed, authorities said. Nishida said Fabela will serve his time in San Bernardino before being brought to Los Angeles for a trial here. She said detectives presented the case to the Los Angeles County District Attorneys Office, but prosecutors have requested additional investigation. A suspect was earlier identified from a video that showed a person wearing a hooded jacket and carrying a backpack. Nishida said it was unknown if the killings may have been precipitated by several pending lawsuits involving Isom, who was a wealthy businessman. In March, Darci S. Isom, the daughter of Armie Isom, filed suit against the daughter of Shirley Isom, alleging fraud and elder abuse. She accused Mischelynn Scarlatelli of conspiring to take control of the estate, thereby altering the rights of inheritance of daughter Darci and her brother and sister.

"Corey Yunke has been on the job as Rosevilles crime analyst for less than two months. But already he has one simple idea for cutting down on the citys vice—report the small things.Before I went into crime prevention, I wouldnt necessarily report the little stuff—like somebody snooping around—because I thought that an officer would roll their eyes, Yunke said.But today, Yunke said he believes that citizens reporting suspicious activity is essential to impeding crime. (He comes to Roseville from Grand Rapids, Michigan, where he worked as a crime prevention organizer.)Yunke points to a recent incident where a Roseville resident reported of person perched on the shoulders of his friend looking into a window. The tip led to a narcotics bust and an investigation into a possible attempted burglary.Yunke said that many crimes in Roseville are crimes of opportunity and that hes seen an uptick in theft from autos.Large parking lots at parks and businesses such as L.A. Fitness are targets for thieves, Yunke said.You leave all your stuff—you leave your wallet, your laptop, your purse—and the people know its there, he said. It doesnt take much—it takes literally five seconds—to break the window, reach in, scoop, grab, and leave, he said.Yunke said he intends to continue working with Rosevilles Neighborhood Watch program, in which more than 100 block captains keep an eye on their communities, to help combat these types of crime.Its tough for the Roseville police to be everywhere all the time so we encourage the block captains to be our eyes and ears, Yunke said.",0
"The Orange County Sheriffs Department will step up Bicycle and Pedestrian Safety Enforcement Operations on Friday with focused enforcement on collision causing factors involving motorists, pedestrians and bicyclists. On June 17, extra officers will be on duty patrolling areas where bike and pedestrian traffic and crashes occur in an effort to lower deaths and injuries. The department has mapped out locations over the past seven years where pedestrian and bike collisions have occurred along, with the violations that led to those crashes, Lt. Mark Stichter said. Officers will be looking for violations made by drivers, bike riders and pedestrians alike that can lead to life changing injuries. Special attention will be directed toward drivers speeding, making illegal turns, failing to stop for signs and signals, failing to yield to pedestrians in cross walks or any other dangerous violation. Additionally, enforcement will be taken for observed violations when pedestrians cross the street illegally or fail to yield to drivers who have the right of way, he said. Bicycle and pedestrian fatalities are rising in California as more people use these non-motorized means of transportation, he said. The Orange County Sheriffs Department has investigated 26 fatal and injury collisions involving pedestrians and bicyclists during the past three years. In 2013, California witnessed 701 pedestrians and 141 bicyclists killed, accounting for more than 28 percent of all traffic fatalities. And dont be surprised if you are pulled over while riding your bike. Riders under 18-years-old must wear helmets by law. Pedestrians should cross the street only in marked crosswalks or at corners. Bike riders will be stopped and citations issued when they fail to follow the same traffic laws that apply to motorists, he said. All riders are reminded to always wear a helmet. Funding for this program is provided by a grant from the California Office of Traffic Safety through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.",0

"Eagan doesnt have an ordinance restricting where Level III sex offenders can live—but neither do most cities in the state, and only one such offender is living in Eagan. Eight cities in Minnesota have essentially banned Level III sex offenders from taking up residence, according to the Star Tribune. Those cities have restrictive local ordinances that work against a Minnesota law intended to spread out the states population of Level III sex offenders. Instead, the offenders are concentrated in a few areas, such as north Minneapolis, the newspaper reported: Nearly 300 of Minnesotas most dangerous sex offenders now live outside confinement, and more than half of them are residing in only a few neighborhoods in Minneapolis and St. Paul, a Star Tribune analysis of state records shows. That saturation is occurring despite a state law that requires authorities who supervise newly released sex offenders to avoid concentrating them in any community. ... In both Minneapolis and St. Paul, frustrated leaders are calling for tougher laws that would result in wider dispersal of the riskiest sex offenders. Read the full article at startribune.com. Where Offenders AreEagan has one Level III sex offender living on Bluestone Lane, according to the map. Burnsville and Savage are also home to a Level III offender.

On Wednesday, Jamie Bowers-Danielson, 35, and Matthew Danielson, 35, both of Ankeny, pleaded guilty to bank fraud in connection with a mortgage fraud scheme to obtain a free house in Ankeny, court officials said. According to the written plea agreement, Matthew Danielson provided false information, including misrepresenting his marital status as single, to the mortgage lender.

This included submitting false and misleading statements and documents to mortgage lenders and banks for the purpose of obtaining loans for herself and other borrowers for which they should have not qualified. The couple entered their pleas before Chief Judge James E. Gritzner of the United States District Court. Judge Gritzner scheduled a sentencing date of July 26, 2013, for the couple.

He said those costs would largely be paid with money saved after the township earlier eliminated part-time firefighter positions. Form a safety perspective, Phillips said reopening the station is the right thing to do. Im 100 percent confident that (reopening the station) will make a difference for people throughout the township, Phillips told the Observer. It will improve response time throughout the entire township.

Reopening it, however, will depend on a joint agreement between Plymouth and Northville townships to share the fire station, which sits on Wilcox Road west of Haggerty. Heise said Tuesday the agreement is imminent. Trustee Bob Doroshewitz voted against hiring the additional firefighters, the Plymouth Observer reported. He thinks the issue is being rushed and could have waited until the township board delves more deeply into its next budget plan. I dont think its fully baked, Doroshewitz said. I dont think its being done in the right order. Photo courtesy of Google Maps.",0

"A 19-year-old girl and her father were arrested Tuesday after police recovered over $11,000 worth of drugs, including LSD and marijuana, in their Crystal Lake home, police said Wednesday. A $103,000 bond has been ordered for Kayli J. Charlette, 19, of Crystal Lake, who faces the following felony charges: two counts of unlawful delivery of a controlled substance within 1,000 feet of a park, two counts of unlawful possession of a controlled substance, unlawful delivery of marijuana, unlawful possession of marijuana and two counts of unlawful possession of a controlled substance. She also faces the following misdemeanor charges: two counts of unlawful possession of drug paraphernalia, two counts of unlawful delivery of marijuana and two counts of unlawful possession of marijuana, according to a McHenry County Sheriffs Office press release. Meanwhile, her father, Raymond D. Charlette, 53, also of Crystal Lake, has been charged with unlawful possession of marijuana, unlawful possession of drug paraphernalia and unlawful possession of marijuana -- all misdemeanor charges. A $3,000 bond was issued in his case. The charges come following a four-month investigation by the McHenry County Sheriffs Police Narcotics Task Force after police received a tip that Kayli Charlette was selling LSD and marijuana. Detectives set up undercover purchases with Kayli from her Crystal Lake home in the 40 block of Gates Street and took her into custody Tuesday at her home. Police allege they found marijuana and drug paraphernalia on Kayli and her father, Raymond, during the execution of an arrest warrant, according to the news release.

"ATLANTA, GA — Traffic in midtown Atlanta remained shut down Saturday morning, after a scaffolding collapsed, causing an explosion at a high-rise apartment building on Friday. The collapse happened on a building at the corner of 14th and West Peachtree streets. Two window washers were on the scaffolding when it collapsed, but they were amazingly able to crawl to safety with the help of residents of the skyscraper. Authorities say that safety harnesses the window washers were wearing probably saved their lives. (For more news like this, find your local Patch here.

According to Atlanta Fire and Rescue, part of the scaffolding hit power lines when it fell, causing an electrical explosion that set a car on fire. For several hours Friday afternoon, the scaffolding dangled dangerously from the building as emergency workers worked to secure it. (See photo, video of the effort below.) It was finally removed some time after 8 p.m. on Friday. As they worked, Atlanta Police shut down 14th Street and West Peachtree — a bustling intersection in the heart of Atlantas Midtown neighborhood. All lanes remained closed at the intersection early Sunday, police said in a news release.  Photo courtesy Atlanta Fire and Rescue",0
"LONG BEACH, CA – A 77-year-old man accused of murdering a Long Beach fire captain and wounding two others at a senior housing complex made his initial court appearance Monday in a wheelchair, but his arraignment was postponed. Thomas Man Kim, who was wearing a hospital gown, did not speak during the brief hearing. A judge agreed to postpone the arraignment until Aug. 15 at the request of Kims public defender, who said she had not been able to communicate with her client due to an apparent medical issue. People who know Kim told a CBS2/ KCAL9 reporter that he is suffering from cancer, has been undergoing chemotherapy and also has a kidney disorder, describing him as very frail. Kim is charged with capital murder and is also facing one count of attempted murder of a firefighter, two counts of attempted murder and one count each of arson of an inhabited structure and explosion with intent to murder in the June 25 killing of Capt. Dave Rosa, who was responding to a report of an explosion at the Covenant Manor senior living facility. Another firefighter, Ernesto Torres, and a civilian who lived in the building were wounded, but survived. Prosecutors will determine later whether to seek the death penalty for Kim, who they allege set off an explosive device in his apartment in an effort to kill a female neighbor who lived above him and with whom he had been feuding. Police said a note that was drafted by Kim led investigators to believe the blast was a murder/suicide attempt. Investigators believe the fire was set as a result of the dispute between Kim and his neighbor, not to draw first responders to the location to ambush them, according to a statement released by the Long Beach Police Department. A search warrant affidavit obtained by the Daily Breeze stated there was an explosion in his (Kims) room earlier and he admitted to officers he has a revolver, and he got scared and started shooting. Kim had burnt hair and clothing when police discovered him while responding to the 11-story complex in the 600 block of East Fourth Street, according to the affidavit. Thousands of mourners gathered at the Long Beach Convention Center last week at a memorial service for Rosa, a 17-year veteran of the Long Beach Fire Department and 45-year-old married father of two sons.Dozens of fire trucks lined the streets outside the Convention Center, and a throng of uniformed firefighters saluted as Rosas flag-draped coffin was slowly driven to the ceremony. The casket was then escorted by pallbearers into the building, led by a color guard carrying flags. Rosas oldest son, Alec, told the crowd gathered at the service that the news of his fathers killing had left him in shock. My dads a fireman. Firemen arent supposed to get shot, he said. The Long Beach Fire Department announced last week that a fund has been established for Rosas family. Information about the fund is available at www.friendsoflbfire.org/police-fire-memorial.

"With this week being Police Week, a number of community members have offered their heartfelt thanks to the men and women in blue this week. The week includes area law enforcement officials honoring those who were disabled or died in the line of duty. More than 19,000 names of fallen law enforcement officers are etched into the walls of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial — and more are added every year. So why is Police Week important? Police officers are hired to protect the public, said Caledonia Police Chief Toby Schey. Its important that the public realize the work we do to serve them. Sometimes we put our lives on the line and someone who goes into law enforcement understands that we may have to sacrifice our lives to save someone else. As police officers we do this every day to protect the public. Schey pointed to what happened with officer Jim Gardiner last week. During a fire, Gardiner broke into a home that was on fire to get a family of four to safety. Going into that house that was on fire, Im sure he didnt know if he was going to come out alive, Schey said. Schey said the community has been lucky that no officers have been killed in the line of duty though they have been injured. Still, law enforcement officers have to carry with them all of the stresses of their job. We take everyones problems home with us everyday and those stresses add up over the course of a career, Schey said. Thats why the alcoholism, divorce and suicide rates are so high amongst officers. When people stop and recognize the job we do with a simple thank you, it helps to rationalize an irrational world. While the Caledonia Police Department hasnt lost any officers during the course of duty, the following officers were killed while on duty while serving the Racine County Sheriffs Department: Deputy Sheriff Henry Denman Racine County Sheriffs Department EOW: Thursday, June 25, 1953 Cause: Vehicle pursuit Deputy Sheriff George W. Hansen Racine County Sheriffs Department EOW: Thursday, June 18, 1953 Cause: Vehicle pursuit Deputy Sheriff Arthur G. Herman Racine County Sheriffs Department EOW: Saturday, May 15, 1920 Cause: Motorcycle accident Because members of the Caledonia Police Department put their lives on the line every day, we put out a call on Facebook to give the community the opportunity to show their support for their men and women in blue. Heres what you had to say: Rosie Olle Thank you so much for all you do in supporting your local baseball / Softball league, All of us in Caledonia, we truly appreciate you. Thank you for keeping an eye on the park for us as well.... Thanks Ed Pestka and Terry Mayne. Chad Tremelling Thank you for your service to our community. Stay safe.",0
"BRANDON, FL — Gary Lynn Durham died as he lived. In an ironic twist of fate, the man killed in a Wednesday morning road rage-related shooting had been convicted in a similar crime in 2002. Durham, 40, was killed after a traffic-related dispute turned violent, the Hillsborough County Sheriffs Office said. It was around 6:30 a.m. when Durham and Robert Padgett, 42, pulled over on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. Exactly what happened to prompt Durham to stop in the middle the road and get out of his Mazda pickup remains unclear. What is clear, the sheriffs office said, is that Durham and Padgett argued. As the dispute escalated, Padgett fired at least one round from a handgun. The shot hit and killed Durham, the sheriffs office said. Padgett, authorities said, called 911 and tried to save the man he just shot. He administered CPR, but the effort failed. Durham was pronounced dead at the scene. As detectives began their investigation into the death, they uncovered Durhams checkered past. The Brandon man had a lengthy history of convictions and incarcerations in the Florida state prison system. His first sentencing came in November 1994 following convictions on such charges as aggravated assault and grand theft. He was also sentenced in 1995 on a string of charges incurred the year prior related to grand theft and trafficking in stolen property, prison records show. Durhams most recent conviction involved an October 2001 manslaughter charge related to the death of Tim Gibbs, 48. The two men were involved in a road rage incident, deputies say. Durham threw a punch that resulted in Gibbs death a few days later. Durham was ultimately charged with manslaughter and convicted. He was sentenced to serve 11 years, eight months and 13 days on Sept. 30, 2002. Durham was released from prison in September 2012. He avoided further brushes with the law in Hillsborough County until his death on Wednesday, records show. Durhams death remains under investigation. Authorities have not charged Padgett in the shooting, saying the case has been turned over to the State Attorneys Office for review. As authorities continue to unravel the details that led up to Durhams death, Gibbs widow told the Tampa Bay Times shes glad she no longer has to worry about bumping into him. Its a shame that he didnt learn his lesson while in jail, Nancy Gibbs told the Times. Its ironic that he died in the same way as my husband.

"There were no injuries after a motor vehicle crashed into a bedroom window of an apartment at 59 Frairy St. just before 7 p.m. Saturday, according to Medfield Police. We are just thankful that the guy who lives in there wasnt in bed, said Medfield police officer Larz Anderson, who is investigating the accident. Thankfully theres no injuries. We can fix the building, we can fix the car, you know its hard to put people back together. Anderson said received a call at 6:50 p.m. that a car crashed into the apartment building at 59 Frairy St. The female operator was checked for injuries by Medfield EMTs. She was fine, Anderson said. We brought the EMTs down to evaluate her and make sure she was [OK]. She was kind of freaked out when the ambulance got here. They evaluated her and she was fine. I think she was just kind of shook up from the whole accident. Anderson said the cause of the accident is unknown and will undergo further investigation at the Medfield Police Station. We dont know as far as what happened, Anderson said. [The operator] said she was pulling up to the curb and her boyfriend was next to her [in another vehicle] and said she was going maybe five miles an hour and all of the sudden the car just accelerated. The accident caused fairly extensive damage to the apartment building, according to Anderson. Damage to the brick and the wall on the inside of the apartment was pushed out and the glass obviously was busted up and scattered through [the tenants] apartment, Anderson said. The building manager arrived to the scene and spoke with Medfield Police and the involved parties and Medfields building inspector reviewed the damage before deeming the vehicle OK to be removed, according to Anderson. [He] said it was OK to remove the car and the building wasnt going to fall down, said Anderson. Police will continue to investigate the accident and review the photos. Well go over some of the pictures that we took and see, Anderson said. Its kind of hard to really decipher what exactly happened. Whether its with pictures or sometimes youre at the scene. Well do our best to try and make some sense of it. Anderson said the operator and her boyfriend believe the car malfunctioned and that they would get the vehicle inspected before it is repaired. Shes pretty sure she was standing on the brake … its hard to tell, Anderson said. The floor mat wasnt stuffed under, which does happen on occasion. Everything appeared to be functioning as it was supposed to as [the tow truck operator] pulled it away. It could have been just a glitch in the computer system. A lot of times they dont even have accelerator cables anymore. Years ago they used to stick but now they do everything electronically. It may be just a glitch in the computer system or maybe operator error thinking that youre on the break. Anderson said he told the vehicle operator to follow through the investigation while the car is repaired. Maybe they will be able to find something, Anderson said. I told her to really be involved in it when the vehicle is repaired so she can explain exactly what she thinks happened. Hopefully theyll find something on the electronics end of it. While Medfield Police said the accident was not a result of drug, alcohol or cell phone use, Anderson said the investigation will likely result in the operator being cited. Shell probably end up being cited for failure to use care and caution and failure to stop, said Anderson. If they do find something wrong with the car then she can just appeal it and say this is what happened. The tenant of the apartment unit the vehicle crashed into said he would not be displaced and the building manager had a crew cleaning up the glass and boarding up the broken window.",0

"CHERRY HILL, NJ — The owner of six gas stations in South Jersey, including one in Cherry Hill, has paid $1,471,024 in back wages and damages to 24 gas station attendants to resolve violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), the U.S. Department of Labor announced on Friday. Manjit Guleria regularly required employees to work seven days a week, 10 or more hours each day, according to an investigation by the Department of Labors Wage and Hour Division. Guleria owns five Citgo stations and one Lukoil station, including the Citgo at 1510 NJ 38 in Cherry Hill. The FLSA requires that covered, non-exempt employees be paid at lease the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hours for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates for hours worked beyond 40 per week. Some states have established minimum wage rates that differ from the federal minimum wage. Where federal and state laws require different wage rates, the higher standard applies. Employees must also maintain accurate time and payroll records. Despite asking his employees to work long hours, Guleria paid them flat salaries that typically resulted in hourly wages well below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, according to the investigation. He also didnt provide additional compensation for overtime. He and his companies were found to have violated the FLSA by failing to pay employees the federal minimum wage or overtime. He also didnt maintain required payroll records. Under the terms of the settlement, 24 employees will receive $735,512 in unpaid minimum wage and overtime compensation and $735,512 in liquidated damages. In addition to the back wages and damages, Guleria paid a $8,976 penalty for the violations and has agreed to future FLSA compliance. The gas stations are now required to use an electronic timekeeping system to track employees hours worked, change break policies to ensure that they pay employees when they are unable to take breaks, and provide employees with information about their rights under the FLSA. In addition to the Cherry Hill Citgo, the gas stations are located at:Citgo, 400 NJ 38 in Maple Shade;Citgo, 102 Washington Crossing Road in Pennington;Citgo, 2006 Mount Holly Road in Burlington;Citgo, 469 Lenola Road in Moorestown; andLukoil, 2225 Admiral Wilson Blvd. in Merchantville. This settlement puts these wages into the hands of the employees who earned them, Department of Labor Southern Jersey District Office Director Charlene Rachor said. The Division encourages employers to avail themselves of the many resources we provide to help them to operate in compliance, and not to find themselves facing the liabilities that can come with breaking the law. New Jersey is one of two U.S. states that bar motorists from pumping their own gas. Gas stations in New Jersey employ full-service gas station attendants to operate gas pumps and provide related customer services. Businesses that violate the law gain a competitive advantage in the industry and undermine law-abiding employers, Department of Labor Regional Solicitor Jeffrey S. Rogoff said. We will vigorously enforce the law to ensure that companies that comply compete on a level playing field and to safeguard employees hard-earned wages.

"The former Main Line commissioner who was recently hit with federal child pornography charges on top of locally-filed charges was ordered to jail ahead of his trial Monday. Philip Ahr, who served as a Radnor Township Commissioner until late 2017, was ordered to be jailed until his upcoming trial Monday by U.S. Magistrate Judge Marilyn Heffley after the 67 year old turned himself in to federal authorities, Philly.com reports. Ahr remained free on bail for the child pornography-related charges filed against him in Delaware County until he was ordered to the Federal Detention Center in Philadelphia Monday. The news about Ahrs federal charges broke last week after an indictment was unsealed. The federal indictment charges Ahr – whose online monikers allegedly were DaddyX and DaddyXX – with two counts each of distribution and attempted distribution of child pornography and receipt of child pornography, as well as one count of possession of child pornography. The incidents leading to the charges span from 2013 to 2017, according to the charging document. These federal charges add to the 130 total charges related to child pornography filed in Delaware County, which are 10 counts of disseminating child pornography, 50 counts of child pornography possession, 60 counts of criminal use of a communication facility, and 10 counts of attempted dissemination of child pornography. Should Ahr be convicted, he faces up to a five-year sentence. His federal trial date has yet to be set. Ahr, of the Rosemont section of Radnor Township, was arrested Oct. 11 by Delaware County authorities following the announcement of a county-led investigation of unknown origin targeting Ahr in late September. He later resigned as the Radnor Township Board of Commissioners president, a position he was elected to in July 2017. However, he maintained his seat as the townships Ward 7 commissioner. Then in early November, Ahr resigned his role with the board entirely, leaving his seat vacant and forcing the township to appoint an interim commissioner.

"A Boston man known as the Incognito Bandit was arrested Friday in a Virginia airport as he attempted to board a South Africa-bound flight, the U.S. Attorneys office said. Albert Taderera, 36, of Brighton, is thought to be involved in 16 bank robberies in Massachusetts since February 2015. He has been charged with armed bank robbery by criminal complaint stemming from the Oct. 7, 2016 robbery of a Wayland TD Bank. Taderera is scheduled to appear in the U.S. District Court for the District of Eastern Virginia on Monday. According to court documents, 16 banks were robbed in the MetroWest and Greater Boston areas between February 2015 and March 2017, including banks in Woburn, Waltham, Arlington, Acton, Wayland, Stoughton, and Billerica. The robber in most cases was covered in a dark hooded sweatshirt, a dark face mask/sunglasses, dark gloves, and dark clothing. In each instance the robber made verbal demands for the money. The robber in many of the robberies displayed what tellers described as a black semi-automatic handgun. All of the robberies occurred in suburban setting near wooded areas of foliage. Witnesses in many instances reported the robber leaving the bank and entering those wooded areas. Some witnesses observed the who is thought to be the robber drive away in a black BMW sedan. On March 16, Concord Police observed a black BMW sedan outside a local bank and noted Taderera fit the description of the person responsible for the 16 robberies. Police determined the BMWs registration was revoked and had it towed and inventoried. On Wednesday, March 22, Taderera called the tow company and was informed his BMW was in police custody. On Thursday night, at about 10:15 p.m., the FBI learned Taderera booked a Friday morning flight from Dulles International Airport to Addis Ababe, Ethiopia. It was learned that Taderera was en route Friday morning to Dulles out of Logan Airport, having changed his flight for Friday evening to Johannesburg, South Africa. Taderera was arrested before boarding the flight. The FBI last year doubled the reward relating to the Bandits capture to $20,000. In February 2016, FBI Boston head Harold H. Shaw said the organization was concerned about his increasingly brazen and violent behavior. Photo courtesy of U.S. Attorneys Office",0

"NEWTOWN, CT — The court hearing for a former Newtown Middle School teacher charged with carrying a loaded gun in school has been postponed, according to The News Times. Court records show Jason Adams was scheduled to appear in Danbury Superior Court on Thursday for a hearing on accelerated rehabilitation, which would erase all charges. The hearing has been rescheduled for Sept. 22. The former Newtown Middle School 8th grade science teacher was accused in April for carrying a loaded .45-caliber pistol to school.

"GENEVA, IL - A 21-year-old inmate being treated at Delnor Hospital stole a correction officers 9 mm handgun on Saturday afternoon and held, at one point, two nurses hostage. The Kane County SWAT team ended up rescuing one of the nurses who remained held at gunpoint and against her will by Tywon Salters, 21, in a hospital room near the emergency room at about 4 p.m., according to police and media reports. Salters was killed after a North Aurora police department officer fired at least one shot at him, the Aurora Beacon-News reports. The Illinois Police Public Integrity Task Force has now been requested to investigate the use of force during the officer-involved shooting, authorities said late Saturday. Salters, of Chicago, had been in custody at the Kane County jail since April 11, however jail records show he has been in custody since March 11. Salters was charged with possession of a stolen vehicle and was given a bail amount of $75,000.  Emergency personnel were first called to the hospital, 300 Randall Road in Geneva, at about 12:30 p.m. Sources said a rush of ambulances headed to Delnor early Saturday afternoon and helicopters could be seen hovering overhead. The extra ambulances were on hand to transfer patients needing immediate emergency care to other area hospitals. The incident began after Salters was taken to the hospital and was receiving treatment in a room on the third floor of the hospital, according to the Aurora Beacon-News. He was under guard by Kane Co. correctional officers and it was unclear why he was there or how he was able to wrangle a gun away from a correctional officer, Kane County Sheriffs Office Lt. Patrick Gengler told the Aurora Beacon-News. There were restraints in the hospital room where Salters was being treated. The hostage situation unfolded in a room near the first-floor emergency room at Delnor, the Daily Herald reports. The corrections officer was able to get away but Salters held a nurse hostage until she also managed to escape. Salters then left the room and took another nurse hostage, States Attorney Joe McMahon said during a Saturday night news conference. After negotiations between Kane County SWAT and Salters deteriorated, the SWAT team entered the hospital room to rescue the hostage victim, authorities said Saturday night. During entry, a Kane County SWAT member fired their weapon, striking Salters. Salters was pronounced deceased at the scene. WATCH: Footage from the scene of the Delnor Hospital hostage standoff: A member of the SWAT team was shot in the upper body and the bullet was lodged in his protective vest, according to the Daily Herald. Its unclear who shot the officer, Gengler said. The officer was treated and then released from the hospital. The nurse was not injured but other people suffered minor injuries during the incident, according to the Aurora Beacon-News.

"MAYFIELD HEIGHTS, OH — A Hawken School teachers husband was held hostage on Monday. The supposed captors wanted a payment to release the man. At least, thats what a scam artist told her over the phone. The teachers husband was fine. She was just the latest target of a scam that claims a persons loved one is being held hostage. The callers say theyve got one of your loved ones and will hold them captive until a ransom is paid. The hope is that victims will be so overwhelmed with panic theyll immediately wire the cash. Sheryl Harris, the director of the Cuyahoga County Department of Consumer Affairs, said the hostage scam was being used on the West Coast a few years ago. It appears the scam has worked its way to Northeast Ohio. We understand people will be scared and concerned for family members, we just want them to start texting family to figure out where the [supposedly affected] person is, she told Patch. They will find out that person is safe and sound. These scammers just want people to be in a panic so they dont think straight. The teacher at Hawken wasnt the only person targeted by one of these scams recently. A Mayfield Heights woman was told her husband had been in a car accident and was refusing to pay for the damages. In response, the womans husband was being held hostage until money was received for the vehicle. If someone is telling you that theres some danger to you or a loved one and a payment will make it OK, that should be a red flag, Harris said. Scammers want to panic you and then give you an immediate solution that will make that problem go away. If folks can remember thats a red flag, we encourage them to text other family members and tell them whats going on. Luckily, the womans husband emailed her while the call was happening. She knew then it was a scam and contacted the police. A 21-year-old Solon man wasnt so lucky. He was traveling out-of-state on April 18 when he got a call from an unknown number. The caller told the man they had his father in captivity and would kill him if they didnt get $900 wired to them. The 21-year-old panicked, went to the nearest Walmart and sent the money. Only after he had sent the money did he reach out to his father and discover he was actually fine, he had never been kidnapped or held hostage. Dont make a payment until you can ascertain the family members whereabouts, Harris said. Do whatever you have to do to get [the scam artist] off the phone and reach out to other people. You can also call the police if you think theres a real threat to your family. Ultimately, the so-called hostage scam is a variation of the grandparent or IRS scams. In all instances, callers are trying to induce panic in their victims. Once the adrenaline is pumping, thinking clearly and cogently becomes more arduous. Thats when mistakes get made. Invariably victims tell us that after they made the payment, they noticed things were amiss. But when youre in a panic you dont see things straight, Harris confirmed. The key to avoid being victimized is to remain calm and to reach out, as soon as possible, to a loved one. Do not make a payment to one of these callers until you have spoken to your loved one.

"MARIETTA, GA -- A Marietta man convicted in the repeated rape of his young relative will spend the rest of his life behind bars, Cobb County District Attorney Vic Reynolds announced Thursday. Robert Lee Martin, 37, was sentenced in the courtroom of Cobb Superior Court Judge Robert D. Leonard II, who told the defendant, Its my intention that you never get paroled and die in prison. A Cobb jury convicted Martin on June 22 for molesting a girl in his family from the time she was 10 years old to age 14. (SIGN UP: Get Patchs Daily Newsletter and Real Time News Alerts. Or, if you have an iPhone, download the free Patch app.) The girl testified at the four-day trial, detailing the horrific abuse she endured for years at the hand of someone she trusted and felt a familial bond with. The judge told Martin that as a family member his job was to protect the girl, not prey on her. If you will do this to your own flesh and blood, youll do it to anybody, Leonard said. So, now it falls to me to protect her, and every other young girl in this community, as best I can. In my view, the best way to do that is to make sure you never walk around a free man in this community again. Prosecutors applauded the girl, who suffered in silence for years before mustering the courage to come forward in 2014 with her plight. The true hero in this case is the victim. This young girl stood up in the face of people who did not believe her and spoke the truth about what had happened to her, Assistant District Attorney David Williamson said. This verdict sends a message to this victim that she is believed. Martin was represented by Marietta attorneys Justin Wyatt and Joel Bergstrom. Image via Cobb Sheriffs Office",0
"WEYMOUTH, MA — A man wanted in connection to a murder has been indicted by a grand jury. A Norfolk County Grand Jury recently came down with an indictment against Cornell Bell, according to the Patriot Ledger. The man is wanted for the death of Michele Clarke and has been on the run since the Aug. 19 murder. Police began investigating the murder after a friend of Clarke called Weymouth police and expressed concerns for her safety. Police responding to Clarkes Lake Street apartment found her dead with obvious wounds. Bell, who has used the aliases Tony Smith, Mark Simmons, Cornel James, Cornel Carara, Cavin Lebert, and Kerrol Florizel Bailey, is considered dangerous and may be armed. Police ask that you do not approach him if you see him, but dial 911 and report his location. He is wanted under two of his aliases for outstanding warrants in Massachusetts, one for assault with intent to murder in 1997 and the other for armed robbery in 2002. Police believe that Bell may be in the Miami-area. Anyone with information on this homicide, or possible information on Baileys whereabouts, should call the Massachusetts State Police at 508-820-2121 or the Weymouth Police Department at 781-335-1212.

"A man caught traveling through Brecksville with three-fourths of a pound of marijuana in his car pleaded guilty to a few charges last month. Kevin K. Robinson Jr., 28, of Oakwood Village, is expected to be sentenced this week in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court for charges of drug trafficking, drug possession and possessing criminal tools. He faces up to eight years in prison. Robinson was pulled over Sept. 19 for a routine speeding violation on Brecksville Road, but wound up facing felony charges after police discovered the marijuana in the car, along with six bundles of cash totaling $6,100. As part of the plea agreement, Robinson forfeited the cash as well as a cell phone, according to a statement from the Cuyahoga County Prosecutors Office. He was also charged with two misdemeanors: speeding and endangering a child, because his daughter was in the car. But those charges were dropped. A report said officers who pulled over Robinson for speeding could smell fresh marijuana in the car. Robinson said he was on his way to court for a previous speeding violation. Because he was on probation, police were able to search his car without a warrant and came up with nearly a pound of marijuana and the cash, bundled into packs of $1,000. Rachel McCafferty and Debbie Palmer contributed to this report.",0

"James Whitey Bulger made an initial appearance in federal court today and  assented to remain detained while he awaits official arraignment, which will probably happen sometime next week. Bulger was escorted into the courtroom by three federal marshals. He was dressed in a white V-neck T-shirt, an open button-down white shirt, dark slacks and sneakers when he appeared before two federal judges this afternoon at the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse in South Boston. Outside the courthouse, a large crowd of spectators and media outlets gathered, many hoping to catch a glimpse of the notorious alleged gangster as he left or entered the courthouse. Inside, the courtroom in which Bulger made his appearance was filled with reporters, court officials and other interested people. Two other court rooms, set up to deal with the expected an overflow of people, also filled up, and courthouse officials ultimately sent people into the jury room. On the Boston Harbor side of the courthouse, armed Coast Guard and Boston Police boats patrolled the waters nearest the building. After the hearing, Bulgers brother, William Bulger, former president of the Massachusetts Senate, was surrounded by reporters as he walked toward his car. The court proceedings today mainly dealt with reading charges brought against Bulger and initiating the process whereby he would find an attorney to represent him. He first made an appearance minutes before 4 p.m. in front of Judge Leo Sorokin. The proceeding lasted no more than 15 minutes. He then had a second appearance, at about 4:14 p.m., in front of Judge Marianne Bowler. Both judges read the charges brought against Bulger. Those include the following: — Conspiracy under RICO (the Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organizations Act) — Substantive RICO count — Violation of the Hobbs Act, which deals with extortion, robbery and interstate commerce violations — Several counts of money laundering — Possession of firearms in furtherance of violent crime — Possession of machine guns — Possession of unregistered machine guns — Transfer and possession of machine guns — Possession of machine guns with obliterated serial numbers Appointing Bulgers attorneyWhile most of this afternoons proceedings were a formality, one matter of substance was addressed: the question of whether Bulger was eligible to receive a court-appointed attorney or whether he could afford his own. Assistant United States Attorney Brian Kelly argued that Bulger had the capacity to afford his own attorney. He was found with over $800,000 cash, he said, adding, We think he has access to family resources. Kelly also said there were 30 guns found with the guy as well, so we certainly dont think this is his last cache. Bulger, who made no comments during the proceedings other than to answer yes or no questions from the judges, did say, in a mumbled voice, that he didnt have money for a lawyer because federal authorities seized it. Judge Leo Sorokin appointed attorney Peter Krupp to serve as Bulgers counsel until Bulger receives, through court appointment or by hire, another attorney Remaining in detainmentOn the issue of bail, proceedings did not progress far. Kelly said, We do believe [Bulger] is dangerous to the community and that he is a risk of flight. Krupp, after consulting Bulger, said, At this point well assent to the detention without waiving any rights. Catherine GreigBulgers female companion for the past 16 years, Catherine Greig, also made a court appearance, before Judge Jennifer Boal. Greig was charged with harboring a fugitive.",0

"Atlanta Police made a large marijuana grow house bust on Monday afternoon at a house on Telford Terrace near Fairburn Road.  The small house inside the nice Glen subdivision, held nearly 250 plants worth over $500,000 says investigators. According to Officer John Chafee, officers responded to an unrelated 911 call in the area of 3228 Telford Terrace in southwest Atlanta.  While on scene at that call officers noticed the odor of marijuana and determined that the odor was coming from 3228 Telford Terrace. According to the AJCs reporting, police have received several tips about the house and it was on Sunday that officers responded to the area on a separate call and noticed the smell.  Investigators went to the home and tried to contact the residents, but no one answered the door. A K-9 was brought to the area and indicated from the roadway that drugs were in the house, wrote the AJC. Officer Chafee told reporters that, officers served the warrant around 12:00pm (Monday) and upon searching the home they discovered a large marijuana grow operation.  There were a minimum of 250 marijuana plants growing inside the home.  Due to the size and amount of plants, investigators say, the value of the marijuana is estimated to be approximately $500,000. A resident who also lives on Telford Terrace, Chris Collins, told Fox 5, yeah, you could smell it every day. You smell it like its next to you. The grow house setup was one that seems pretty elaborate from the police descriptions.  The police say, the plants were in four rooms of the house and divided according to size, and that, an irrigation system had been set up to hydrate the plants. Surprisingly no arrests were made and investigators are still working at identifying all of the suspects and obtaining arrest warrants. Should marijuana be legal?  Would that decriminalize the industry so that grow houses like this would not be hiding in our neighborhoods? Tell us your thoughts in the Comments Section Below.

To retaliate, the guitar owner and an accomplice scratched a sexual drawing and expletives on the Winder mans car. All three were arrested. Yapping Leads to Gun Confrontation: A exchange of words outside a Dacula-area QuikTrip on Christmas Eve led to two men going to their vehicles to get their guns. Inside the convenience store, one of the men told the clerk to stop yapping, to which the second man, a Buford resident, replied, Dogs yap, Im a grown man. The jawing kept going outside, where the first man went to his Porsche Cayman, grabbed his gun and pointed it at the Buford man, who went to his truck to get his piece. The suspect then drove away. No shots were fired. Not Sticker-Shocked: A bumper sticker on a 1999 Chevrolet Suburban was holiday-inspired — Love God. Love People. But that didnt keep it from being stolen from a Peachtree Corners driveway on Christmas Eve. This for $15?

"Beware of people bearing free ice cream. On Wednesday, police arrested a Somerset man for allegedly using a nonprofit organization to convince hundreds of senior citizens to submit to unnecessary genetic testing, the U.S. Attorneys Office (NJ) announced. As a result of the alleged scam, Seth Rehfuss, 41, bilked the federal Medicare system out of more than $1 million, obtaining tens of thousands of dollars in commissions, prosecutors charge. Rehfuss was scheduled to appear in Newark federal court on Wednesday. According to authorities, beginning in July of 2014, Rehfuss and other unidentified persons used the Point Pleasant-based Good Samaritans of America as a front to gain access to several low-income senior housing complexes, claiming that the nonprofit helped seniors to navigate federal benefit programs. However, authorities are charging that once Rehfuss had access to the housing complexes, he used fear-based tactics to swindle the elderly residents into submitting to genetic testing, warning them that they were vulnerable to heart attacks, stroke, cancer and suicide if they didnt take his advice. In an effort to increase attendance at his presentations, Rehfuss would advertise that free ice cream would be available, authorities stated. During the presentations, Rehfuss and other participants would take DNA swabs from the senior citizens, always without the involvement or recommendation of any healthcare provider, prosecutors say. In order to get the tests authorized, Rehfuss then allegedly used advertisements on Craigslist to recruit healthcare providers for the scheme, posting advertisements for a Part-time doctor, physicians assistant or nurse practitioner, 2 hours a week, $2,000 (Your Office). After entering into contractual relationships with The Good Samaritans of America, the healthcare providers received requisition forms that often included the patients personal information, Medicare information, medication lists and diagnosis codes. The healthcare providers were paid thousands of dollars per month to sign their names to requisition forms authorizing testing for patients that they never examined. As a result, the Medicare program paid more than $1 million to two clinical laboratories in California and Virginia and Rehfuss collected tens of thousands of dollars for his efforts, authorities allege. According to prosecutors, Rehfuss and other unnamed confederates were actively working towards expanding the scheme outside New Jersey into other states such as Georgia, Delaware, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Michigan, Mississippi, Florida, Tennessee and Arizona. The charge of healthcare fraud carries a maximum potential penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense, prosecutors stated.",0

"I contacted Lakewood Police spokesman Chris Lawler today about additional information regarding Specifically, I asked him this question: 1) Does the city plan to do anything about the animals, i.e., close down the area, trap them? Here was his response: Since this was an isolated incident and not totally unprovoked, we have no plans to do anything with the raccoons/area unless we have another incident. This was a person with a dog interacting with wildlife that was probably protecting its young. Ive notified our parks department and animal control will also be monitoring the area. Our animal control has already spoke with Fish and Wildlife and they concur no additional action is needed right now.  If we have another incident, then we will consider further action, such as trapping them and/or closing off the area. Also, Lawler shared a link from the state Department of Fish & Wildlife that provided some tips about raccoons: Dont feed raccoons. Feeding raccoons may create undesirable situations for you, your children, neighbors, pets, and the raccoons themselves. Raccoons that are fed by people often lose their fear of humans and may become aggressive when not fed as expected. Artificial feeding also tends to concentrate raccoons in a small area; overcrowding can spread diseases and parasites. Finally, these hungry visitors might approach a neighbor who doesnt share your appreciation of the animals. The neighbor might choose to remove these raccoons, or have them removed. Dont give raccoons access to garbage. Keep your garbage can lid on tight by securing it with rope, chain, bungee cords, or weights. Better yet, buy garbage cans with clamps or other mechanisms that hold lids on. To prevent tipping, secure side handles to metal or wooden stakes driven into the ground. Or keep your cans in tight-fitting bins, a shed, or a garage. Put garbage cans out for pickup in the morning, after raccoons have returned to their resting areas. Feed dogs and cats indoors and keep them in at night. If you must feed your pets outside, do so in late morning or at midday, and pick up food, water bowls, leftovers, and spilled food well before dark every day. Keep pets indoors at night. If cornered, raccoons may attack dogs and cats. Bite wounds from raccoons can result in fractures and disease transmission. Prevent raccoons from entering pet doors.  Keep indoor pet food and any other food away from a pet door. Lock the pet door at night. If it is necessary to have it remain open, put an electronically activated opener on your pets collar. Note: Floodlights or motion detector lights placed above the pet door to scare raccoons are not long-term solutions. Put food in secure compost containers and clean up barbecue areas. Dont put food of any kind in open compost piles; instead, use a securely covered compost structure or a commercially available raccoon-proof composter to prevent attracting raccoons and getting exposed to their droppings. A covered worm box is another alternative. If burying food scraps, cover them with at least 8 inches of soil and dont leave any garbage above ground in the area—including the stinky shovel. Placing a wire mesh barrier that is held in place with a heavy object over the in-ground compost will prevent problems. Clean barbecue grills and grease traps thoroughly following each use. Eliminate access to denning sites. Raccoons commonly use chimneys, attics, and spaces under houses, porches, and sheds as den sites. Close any potential entries with ¼-inch mesh hardware cloth, boards, or metal flashing. Make all connections flush and secure to keep mice, rats, and other mammals out. Make sure you dont trap an animal inside when you seal off a potential entry (see Evicting Animals from Buildings). For information on securing chimneys, see Raccoons in Dumpsters and Down Chimneys. Prevent raccoons from accessing rooftops by trimming tree limbs away from structures and by attaching sheets of metal flashing around corners of buildings. Commercial products that prevent climbing are available from farm supply centers and bird-control supply companies on the Internet. Remove vegetation on buildings, such as English ivy, which provide raccoons a way to climb structures and hide their access point inside.

"WAVERLY, TN -- Humphreys County sheriffs deputies executed search warrants Friday on two homes connected to missing Nashville firefighter Jesse Reed, as efforts to locate the 32-year-old who drove into the Tennessee River Monday continue. Deputies, assisted by agents from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, searched a home in Humphreys County and another in Cheatham County. Reed had lived at both homes, according to Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis. I feel that it would be irresponsible of me to not exhaust all means possible in our efforts to attempt to locate Mr. Reed, Davis told The Tennessean. We have no evidence to indicate that he is not still in this water. Investigators believe Reeds truck entered the water about 1:30 a.m. Monday. Deputies found the vehicle already submerged and Reeds wife out of the water. Dive crews located the truck around noon Monday, but Reed was not inside. Exhaustive searches of the river have yet to turn up his body or other evidence. Photo via Nashville Fire Department",0

"Michael A. Carver Jr. is going to prison for 10 years after a jury found him guilty of robbing the Circle K on North Mantua Street at knifepoint in April 2012. Carver, 32, walked into the Circle K on April 7, 2012 and went around the counter, showed a knife to a clerk and told her Dont do something stupid, Portage County Prosecutor Victor Vigluicci said in the Record-Courier. The prosecutor said a scream alerted her co-worker. Authorities said Carver grabbed the clerks cell phone, ran away and left a red sweatshirt he was wearing at the time on the ground. DNA evidence on the sweatshirt and a visible tattoo led authorities to the suspect. Carver, formerly of 602 Harris St., was found guilty of two counts of aggravated robbery, both first-degree felonies, according to Portage County Court records.

"While the doors havent even opened to the public yet, someone managed to break into the Wyandotte Jaycees haunted house on Tuesday night, getting away with about $9,000 of tools. The tools belonged to Jaycees members who donate their time and equipment to turn a city building into a frightful attraction each year. This is not stealing from the Jaycees as an organization, this is stealing from all the hardworking men and women that come here and volunteer their time, Jaycees member Nadia Brunt told WJBK-TV. The thief kicked in the front door of the haunted house to gain entry, as well as smashed the windows of an adjacent storage warehouse. Tools, wiring and other items were reported stolen. Jaycees volunteer Ryan Cunningham posted a message on Facebook to the thief. We have been working diligently for over a month to provide a form of entertainment to the community, he wrote. You in no way will stop us, but you have made it harder to deliver the service we provide every year. The only hope I have is that karma catches up with you. Despite the setback, volunteers said they remain dedicated to opening the haunted house, 1096 Biddle, as planned on Oct. 4. Money raised from the event goes back into the Jaycees many community service projects. The haunted house, named Nightmare Sanctum, will be open Oct. 4-7, 11-14, 18-21 and 25-30. Hours are from 7 to 10 p.m., except for Fridays and Saturdays, which go through midnight. The cost is $12 per person. Cash and credit are accepted. The Jaycees partner with the city of Wyandotte on its haunted house. The city provides the Jaycees with a building thats set to be demolished. The Jaycees come in, transform the building into a haunted house during October, and return the building to the city afterward. This years haunted house is in the building that formerly housed Fronczaks Garage. In years past, the Jaycees have converted a former biker clubhouse, the former Wyandotte Police Department, the former Wyandotte Theater and several residential homes into a haunted house.

"Taxpayers will contribute $1.73 million into firefighters pension fund, after approval in a unanimous vote by the three-member board of directors of Monarch Fire Protection District last Wednesday. The Monarch district, headquartered in Chesterfield, also covers portions of , Ballwin, Creve Coeur, Clarkson Valley and Maryland Heights. The $1.73 million was paid to DWS Sudder, according to the district documents projected on a screen at Wednesdays meeting. The board had a closed pension meeting prior to the regular meeting. The district pays into the pension an average of $14,000 per person, board member Robin Harris said. Apparently, the pension payment is the same as the prior year, because it is not an assessment year when resident real property taxes may fluctuate based on property values; that happens every two years. In other business, Monarch board members approved payment of $106,000 for producing 59 checks. In a previous meeting, board president Kim Evans encouraged district staff to look into digital production of check stubs to save money. Payroll checks are produced every two weeks. The district plans a new website, after about 10 years without a redesign. The board agreed to spend $3,250 with CMS Express.com on Chief Tom Vineyards recommendation, after looking into several companies. Assistant Fire Chief John Borgmann said the new website would be very interactive. He said a team of Monarch employees would be updating the site, adding photos, and other items. Evans asked for information about community resources in emergencies to be added to the new site. The website would be similar to one the same company designed for Sedona Fire District, in Arizona. Borgmann also said the designers suggested a new logo.",0

"Throughout the month of October, Orland Park police will be out in the community to ensure drivers and pedestrians safely follow traffic-safety laws. OPPD will be out three separate times to conduct its second Cop on a Bus awareness campaign. Patrol officers will ride along on Orland Park school buses watching for vehicles passing school buses when the stop arms are out and the stop lights are flashing. When the officer spots a violation, he or she will report it to a partner working the area who will then initiate a traffic stop. Orland Park Police conduct the Cop on a Bus campaign as a way to ensure that all drivers are properly stopping for school buses that are either loading or unloading school children, Trustee Dan Calandriello said, head of the villages Public Safety Committee. Often drivers are distracted or in a hurry, but we want everyone to take the extra time to follow protocol and keep school zones safe. According to the Illinois State Board of Education, children are at the greatest risk when they are getting on or off the school bus. Most children killed in bus-related crashes are pedestrians, five to seven years old, who are getting on or off the bus. These children are hit by the school bus or by motorists illegally passing a stopped school bus. Officers will be issuing citations to drivers who do not stop when a school bus has its stop arm out. This is a crucial safety law that everyone must follow, said Police Chief Tim McCarthy. According to the Illinois State Police, it is unlawful for a driver to pass a school bus that has stopped to load or unload children when its stop signal arm is extended. School bus drivers may call police with the license plate numbers of vehicles that illegally pass them. In those instances, state statute provides that the owner is responsible for identifying the operator of the vehicle if they were not the driver when the violation occurred. Otherwise, the owner faces the charges. As residents prepare for Halloween, OPPD will conduct numerous pedestrian crosswalk safety checks at various crosswalks within the village, including Ravinia Avenue by the Orland Park Public Library, on 151st St. by Lakeview Plaza, and by Catalina Drive. OPPD reminds drivers that they must come to a complete stop and yield when a pedestrian is in the marked crosswalk. Under the state law, a crosswalk is present whenever a sidewalk leads into the street, regardless of any markings present, Calandriello said. As soon a pedestrian has entered the crosswalk, drivers are required to stop, not just slow down. Its important for drivers to cautiously look out for pedestrians. McCarthy added, The goal of these checks is to ensure that pedestrians are kept safe while walking in the village, and that drivers are well aware of – and follow - the states traffic-safety laws.",0

"MANCHESTER, NJ — A Manchester Township man who authorities say had thousands of images of children performing sexual acts has been arrested, the Ocean County Prosecutors Office announced Wednesday. Lawrence Fascia, 63, of Manchester, was arrested Tuesday on one count of third-degree possession of child pornography and one count of second-degree child pornography, said Al Della Fave, spokesman for the prosecutors office. Fascia became the target of an investigation after the FBI received an anonymous tip regarding his activities on the internet, Della Fave said. The FBI passed the tip along to the High Tech Crime Unit of the Ocean County Prosecutors office as part of their partnership in the Innocent Images Initiative Task Force, he said. The investigation, by the High Tech Crimes Unit, with assistance from the prosecutors offices Megans Law Unit, revealed that Fascia was allegedly actively trading images with other adults of prepubescent children engaged in sexual acts, Della Fave said. A search warrant was executed at Fascias Drake Road residence on Tuesday, and the search revealed a collection of thousands of graphic images of prepubescent children engaged in sexual acts, as well as evidence of trading the images via email as Fascia built his collection, Della Fave said. Fascias bail was originally set at $25,000, no 10 percent option, by Judge Wendel Daniels. Due to substantial health-related issues, Fascia was released to home confinement, Della Fave said. Fascia is required to be on ankle bracelet monitoring until trial and is prohibited from accessing the internet and electronic devices/computers as a condition of his release, he said.

"LAWRENCEVILLE, GA — A 73-year-old Gwinnett County man has been convicted of repeatedly raping a teen relative of his over the course of several years. A Superior Court jury took two hours Thursday to convict Benjamin Daniels on charges of rape, aggravated child molestation, child molestation and incest. He is scheduled to be sentenced for his crimes on August 1. Evidence during Benjamins four-day trial showed that on Sept. 19, 2014, a sister of Benjamins then 15-year-old victim walked into a bedroom to discover Daniels — who was 70 at the time — on top of the victim in the act of sexual intercourse. The sister who saw the act reported it to administrators at South Gwinnett High School the following Monday. When approached by school administrators and Snellville Police, the victim said shed been molested by Daniels on and off for more than seven years at locations in Clayton, DeKalb and Gwinnett counties. She acknowledged she was being raped when her sister saw the act, but said she didnt say anything because she was used to it. She told police shed maintained her silence out of fear for what the information would have done to her family and out of physical fear of Daniels — who had previous served prison time for voluntary manslaughter, aggravated assault, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony and possession of a sawed-off shotgun. During his trial, Daniels maintained that he had never done anything sexually inappropriate to the victim, that he had rejected her sexual advances the day her sister saw them and, also, that he believes Georgias legal age for sexual consent should be lowered from 16 to 14. The August 1 sentencing day in the case, set by Judge Tom Davis, is meant to allow the victim and her family to testify regarding Daniels sentence. Photo via Gwinnett County Sheriffs Office",0

"Orange County prosecutors are expected to dismiss charges Friday against a former Fullerton officer accused in the deadly struggle of Kelly Thomas. Former Officer Joe Wolfe was next due in court for a trial-setting conference Jan. 24 following the acquittal of former co-workers, Jay Cicinelli and Manuel Ramos, but it was moved up to Friday so prosecutors could have an opportunity to dismiss charges, Wolfes attorney, Vicki Podberesky said.

"OAKLAND, CA — A judge ordered Ghost Ship warehouse master tenant Derick Almena and creative director Max Harris to stand trial on 36 counts of involuntary manslaughter for their roles in a blaze at the warehouse last year that killed 36 people. At the end of a preliminary hearing Thursday for Almena, 47, and Harris, 28, which lasted six days, Alameda County Superior Court Judge Jeffrey Horner said the fire during a music party at the warehouse at 1305 31st Ave. in Oaklands Fruitvale district the night of Dec. 2, 2016, was an unspeakable tragedy. Horner said testimony at the tense hearing, which was guarded by five bailiffs, indicated that the warehouse, where about 25 people lived even though it didnt have a permit for residential use and was cluttered with artwork, woodwork, RVs, trailers and other items, was a death trap. Horner said the question is who was responsible for the dangerous conditions at the warehouse, which also was known as the Satya Yuga Collective, and he concluded, There is very strong evidence it was the responsibility of these two defendants (Almena and Harris). The judge said, They both had integral and substantial roles in the management of the premises. Horner said, There is sufficient cause to believe that both defendants are legally responsible for what happened that night and the deaths of 36 people. The six defense attorneys who represent Almena and Harris made much of the fact that investigators from the Oakland Fire Department and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were never able to conclusively determine the cause of the fire, although an Oakland fire official said she believes it likely was caused by some type of an electrical problem. Tony Serra, one of Almenas lawyers, argued before Horner issued his ruling, If you dont know what the cause was you cant establish negligence. Tyler Smith, one of Harris attorneys, said, You cant rule out arson, spontaneous combustion or the possibility that it was an accident like someone knocking over a candle or incense. Smith said it could also be argued that many of the deaths were caused by a woman who a witness testified was wearing a red beanie and a green dress and repeatedly screamed, This is the will of the spirits of the forests and urged people who were on the buildings second floor to stay there for their own safety, since the fire was downstairs. Smith said that womans screams may be the reason many victims wound up trapped on the second floor. He said, Maybe they heard her. Prosecutor Autrey James said he believes Almena and Harris were criminally negligent because they allowed people who lived at the warehouse to accumulate flammable chemicals and wood that was stacked to the ceiling. James also said Almena and Harris oversaw the construction of an illegal second set of stairs at the building and the drilling of a 25-foot hole that he said opened an air draft that allowed smoke to spread quickly to the second floor during the fire and cause the deaths of 36 people. In addition, James said the building didnt have emergency lighting, sprinklers and fire alarms. But Serra said, The premises was not a fire trap. It was mystical, overwhelming, spiritual, ascetic, social and a community of artists and people of integrity who were not related to commerciality, greed or financial gain. Serra argued that the buildings owner, Chor Ng, who returned to China after the fire, had primary responsibility and also alleged that the Oakland Fire Department knew about the conditions at the warehouse but didnt take any action and is far more culpable than my client (Almena). After the hearing, Serra said he had expected that Horner would order Almena and Harris to stand trial but he thinks a jury will see this case a little bit differently and might not convict the two men. Curtis Briggs, one of Harris attorneys, said, Were extremely encouraged because we saw the District Attorneys evidence and their evidence against Max Harris was minimal. Briggs said he believes the fire was caused by the systematic malfunction of the city of Oakland in failing to properly oversee the warehouses operations and the fault isnt Max Harris. Almena and Harris, who face up to 39 years in state prison if theyre convicted, remain in custody in lieu of $750,000 bail and are scheduled to return to court on Jan. 2 to have their trial date set. — Bay City News; Image via Alameda County",0

"LAKEWOOD, NJ — Christy and CJ Keronen were as close as siblings can be, getting through the challenges that life has presented them, as a team. When their mother, Corrine, died nine years ago, they pulled together to help their family, including their father, get through the devastating loss of their matriarch, the backbone of our family, CJ Keronen said. When Christy started talking about starting her own cleaning business and asked CJ to help her, he agreed. They listened to each others problems, and helped each other in myriad ways. Christy and I have lived together virtually our whole lives, CJ Keronen said in an email Thursday afternoon. And now for the first time, Im helpless to save her. Thats because his 29-year-old sister was found dead Wednesday, less than a day after she went missing, in the Jackson Township home of a man whom shed known for about a year. The lifeless body of that man, Tyree Johnson, 32, was found hanging from the bucket of a Comcast truck parked in the parking lot of a group of offices on South Holmdel Road in Holmdel Township earlier Wednesday, according to Al Della Fave, spokesman for the Ocean County Prosecutors Office. Christy Keronens body was found in Johnsons home on Lexington Court when police from Holmdel and Jackson went to make family notification of Johnsons death, Della Fave said. She had suffered head trauma, Della Fave said. Authorities are investigating it as a murder-suicide, Della Fave said Thursday. Read more: Police Release Details Of Murder-Suicide In Holmdel And Jackson I lost my sister, my best friend, CJ Keronen said in a post on Facebook on Thursday. Words cant even explain what Im feeling right now. By email, CJ said his sister was the kind of person who helped anyone and everyone. She did things out of the kindness of her heart and was never about receiving any kind of recognition to do so, he said, adding that there was no one story that summed up her kindness. Countless times Ive seen her give money to the homeless hanging outside our local Wawa, lending money to friends whenever they needed, even if she was short on funds herself, said CJ, who is six years older than Christy. Mostly though she was great at listening to other peoples problems and helping them through their situation. Whether it was relationship advice, finding work, anything that was ever asked of her, she felt compelled to do what should could. She also knew what she wanted and didnt want, CJ said. Christy had been talking to me about starting her own cleaning company, he said. His sister, a 2005 graduate of Howell High School, had earned a medical assistant certification from Star Career Academy, but had been working with CJ cleaning offices more recently. Shes been cleaning up around the offices from where we work as was her job, and really wanted to start something for herself, he said. Shed started creating lists of supplies she might need, searched for rates, everything that she felt she would need to get started. She even asked me to help her run the scheduling and financial side, which I obviously agreed that I would. Her plan for the business was simply an extension of the team they had already become; CJ said that after their mother died, Christy and I were responsible for keeping us all together. With my dad getting older, now 70, it has been up to us to keep things running, CJ said. Working, cooking, cleaning. Making sure our bills and rent get paid. It all fell on us, but as a team, we made it work. CJ said he did not know much about his sisters relationship with Johnson, beyond that they had known each other for more than a year and had a few mutual friends. But his sister, who did not appear to have a boyfriend from her Facebook profile, had been clear that she only viewed Johnson as a friend, CJ said. I often times would overhear her venting to friends about how shes not looking for a relationship right now, and how Tyree needs to understand this or they can no longer be friends, CJ said. The last conversation he had with his sister was mundane. The siblings had the day off from work due to Rosh Hashanah, and she left the house to run some errands. The last conversation I had with her was just to ask her what she had planned for the day, CJ said. She mentioned that she still needed to look for a dress for a wedding we were supposed to go to this Friday. I thought nothing of it really, when I came downstairs a few hours later, she had already left. When she had not come home Tuesday night, and missed work Wednesday without calling to let anyone know, CJ began searching for her, and filed a missing persons report with Lakewood police. It was just hours later that authorities notified him that Christy had been found dead, according to both CJ and Della Fave. The hardest thing I ever had to do in my life was to explain to my father that his baby girl is dead, CJ said in the Facebook post where he told friends his sister was found dead. Friends responding to his post remarked with comments about Christys kindness and warmth. Your sister was an amazing person and I was so lucky to have experienced that, Brittany Alfaro said. Christy will always be remembered for her big heart & great laugh!! Destinie Brannigan wrote. She was always the warmest & sweetest person. My heart hurts for you & your Dad & I am so sorry. May she rest in peace. Im doing my best to hold it together while still trying to get the word out on how wonderful a person she was, CJ said by email. She deserved so much more out of life ... And now for the first time, Im helpless to save her. I love you Christy Keronen ... May you forever rest in peace, CJ Keronen said in his Facebook post.

John Hickenlooper called the latest shooting a senseless act of violence. With the recent loss of now three deputies and many others injured, theres no denying the grave impact this sequence of shootings is having on our state, Hickenlooper said. We will once more come together to provide sympathy and strength for the deputys loved ones and pray for the recovery of those injured; however, we also must come together and say enough is enough. We want each officer, every deputy, to know we are grateful for their service. Eight officers in the U.S. have been killed in the line of duty since the start of the year.

(To sign up for Wallingford breaking news alerts and more, click here.) The police department urges residents to lock their car doors and do not leave their keys or valuables inside the vehicle. By doing so, a crime of opportunity is created, Colavolpe said in a press release. A majority of the vehicles stolen have been recovered in Hamden, Hartford, or New Haven. The vehicles have been recovered with little or no damage. In some of the cases, arrests have been made and in others the vehicles have been located unoccupied. Those arrested have been male youths ranging in age from 15 to 18 years old. In the cases of thefts from motor vehicles, Colavolpe said the suspects have been using stolen vehicles from other communities to commit the crimes. Recently, police have interrupted some of these thefts while they were in progress, however, the suspects have led police in vehicle pursuits, Colavolpe said. Since the severity of the crime does not outweigh the danger to the public, the pursuits have been called off and the suspects have not been identified. Police have made several arrests in the theft from motor vehicles cases based upon various evidence, including fingerprint or DNA evidence that has been recovered from the scene in some cases, according to Colavolpe. In other cases, the suspects have been identified through surveillance photos. The suspects have been male youths ranging in age from 15 to 18 years of old, according to Colavolpe. On Sunday night, two juveniles — one from Newington and one from Middletown — along with an 18-year-old from Bridgeport were arrested at the Oakdale Theatre for entering into unlocked vehicles. The three suspects entered the vehicles while patrons were inside the theater attending a concert, Colavolpe said. One of the juveniles led police on a lengthy foot chase before being apprehended. Early this morning, two juveniles and an 18-year-old from Hartford were arrested following a pursuit in which they were operating a stolen vehicle out of Rocky Hill. It is suspected that police caught these suspects while they were casing out neighborhoods to commit more thefts. The Wallingford Police Department has increased their patrols of neighborhoods during the overnight hours but asks that residents be vigilant and report any suspicious activity immediately.

"OAK LAWN, IL -- Oak Lawn Fire Department Chief George Sheets retired on Tuesday. Sheets was the villages first African American fire chief and served in that capacity since 2009. He also assumed the responsibilities as chief for the Village of Chicago Ridge in 2014, under a model shared use intergovernmental agreement approved by the governing bodies of both communities. Sheets also reportedly retired last week from his position as fire chief for Chicago Ridge. Deputy Fire Chief Robert Tutko was appointed Oak Lawns acting fire chief during the village boards executive session following Tuesdays regular village board meeting. Tutkos appointment takes effect immediately. I thanked George for his service and wished him and his family the very best in his future endeavors, Deetjen said. Sheets began his firefighting career in Missouri in 1981. He spent the past two decades in fire chief positions in Michigan and Wisconsin. He was recognized as an organizational change manager and is one of only 600 firefighters throughout the country to earn the prestigious designation as a chief fire officer, according to his bio on the Village of Oak Lawn website. He presided over Oak Lawns fire department during periods of great volatility. Sheets said he had been contemplating retiring for the past year. After serving 36 years in the fire service with 22 of those years as a career fire chief, nine years with the Village of Oak Lawn, and four years serving concurrently as the shared fire chief in Chicago Ridge, reporting to twelve board members, two mayors and a village manager, it is time to move forward, Sheets said. To say that I have not been tremendously challenged, reporting to fifteen elected officials who have varying degrees of opinions, needs and wants, would be an understatement of the grandest kind. Sheets said he had no ill will toward Oak Lawns board of trustees but stated he and the village board had differences of opinions for how things were done. The route theyre going puts a wedge into good relations with the fire department, Sheets said. [Oak Lawns] is a fantastic fire department and organization, with a good bunch of firefighters who take care of the community. Yes, there were issues as there with any other fire department, but its how you address those issues. My approach was to sit down as a team to discuss it. I am totally at peace with my decision, he said. Image via Village of Oak Lawn",0

"MIAMI, FL — Miami Marlins pitcher Jose Fernandez had cocaine in his system and was intoxicated at the time of his September death. A toxicology report released Saturday indicated the standout pitcher, who attended Tampas Alonso High School, had a blood-alcohol content of nearly twice the legal limit. Fernandez, 24, died in the early morning hours of Sept. 25 when the 32-foot boat he was on crashed into a jetty in Miami Beach. Eduardo Rivero, 25, and Emilio Jesus Macias, 27, also died in the crash that rocked not only the baseball world, but also the Tampa and Miami communities. Saturdays release of the toxicology reports came after a legal dispute erupted involving the Miami-Dade County Medical Examiners Office, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the Miami Herald. See also: Jose Fernandez Remembered as Special Player by High School Coach The county was prepared to release the report earlier but was informed FWC was conducting a criminal investigation into the death. That agency wanted the county to abstain from releasing the autopsy and toxicology reports until its investigation was concluded, a statement from Miami Mayor Carlos A. Gimenez said. The Miami Herald filed a lawsuit against the Miami-Dade Medical Examiner for the release of the report. When FWC wouldnt join the public records suit as a co-defendant, the county opted to release the report, Gimenez said. Because our role in this matter is complete and Fish and Wildlife has the responsibility to prove an active criminal investigation, I have directed the Medical Examiner to fulfill public records request for the autopsy and toxicology reports today, Gimenez said Saturday. See also: Jose Fernandez, Miami Marlins Pitcher, 2 Others Killed in Boating Accident Those reports revealed Fernandezs intoxication. His blood alcohol content was 0.147, which is well above the legal limit of .08, the Herald reported. The reports also indicated that both Rivero and Macias had alcohol in their systems at the time of their deaths, but neither was legally drunk. Rivero also had cocaine in his system, the Herald added. FWCs investigation into the September crash remains active. It remains unclear if Fernandez was driving the boat. He was its owner, however. An affidavit released earlier this week indicated that Fernandez and his two friends had been drinking at the time of the crash. The report indicated the three had a strong odor of alcohol emanating from them. See also: Miami Marlins Pitcher Jose Fernandez and 2 Others Killed in Boating Crash Had Strong Odor of Alcohol According to the affidavit, the three men were at a bar before the crash. A receipt for alcohol purchased at the bar was found in the pocket of one of the occupants. The affidavit does not mention a cause of death, but the associate medical examiner is quoted as saying all three males died with water in their lungs and had blunt trauma consistent with death from a boating collision. Fernandez, a native of Cuba, had strong ties to Tampa. He attended Alonso High School and was a standout member of the Ravens baseball team. News of Fernandezs death rocked the Tampa Bay area and the Alonso High School community. Alonso Highs baseball coach since the school opened in 2001, Landy Faedo, coached Fernandez from 2009 to 2011. Fernandez attended Alonso after he, his mother and sister defected from Cuba after three attempts. When I first saw him, I knew he was special, Faedo told Patch after Fernandezs death. I had no doubt that he was going to be drafted and play pro ball. That prediction came true when he was drafted in the first round by the Miami Marlins in 2011. Fernandez quickly advanced through the minor leagues and made the Opening Day roster in 2013. Fernandez has been described as a pillar of the Miami community. That assessment held true in Tampa, as well, Faedo said. He was a great guy, Faedo said. His teammates gravitated toward him. People just gravitated toward him. He was so full of energy and he lived life to the fullest. With reporting by Amanda Lamela and Feroze Dhanoa Main Image Credit: Arturo Pardavila III via Flickr, Creative Commons",0

We would like to hear from whomever may be caring for TeMyah Plummer, probably a family member, Major Crimes Sergeant Frank Scarpa said in a Facebook post. We need to confirm that she is safe. The Hudson County (New Jersey) Prosecutors Office also had been seeking the publics help in identifying the baby. The investigation is ongoing and pending the medical examiners report, Raymond Worrall with the Hudson County Prosecutors Office told Patch. The baby was found April 11, shortly after 12:30 p.m., when the Port Authority Police Department received a report of suspected human remains being recovered near train tracks in Jersey City. The suspected human remains were found in a suitcase by a Port Authority employee during a routine inspection. Responding Port Authority police officers confirmed the finding, established a crime scene and contacted the Hudson County Prosecutors Homicide Unit. TeMyah was described as a 2-year-old black female with a light complexion. She was last seen by Richmond-based family members in August 2017. A month ago, it was believed the father and daughter may have relocated to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, area or, perhaps, Jersey City.

"LAKE COUNTY, IL -- A Grayslake mom claims a Round Lake police officer used excessive force when she shot and killed her son last year and has now filed a federal lawsuit against the veteran officer and the village of Round Lake, the Daily Herald reports. The lawsuit, filed by the attorneys for Arona Musson on Friday, states Round Lake Police Department officer Valerie Liss willfully and wantonly (used) unreasonable, excessive, unjustified, and deadly force when she fatally shot Michael Musson on Sept. 2, 2016. The suit is seeking unspecified punitive and compensatory damages, according to the Daily Herald. The lawsuit comes weeks after the Lake County States Attorney determined Liss, a 13-year veteran of the Round Lake Police Department, used reasonable force when she shot and killed Musson, 22, of Grayslake. An investigation into the incident revealed Musson took acid earlier in the evening and was apparently attempting to break into condominiums when Liss responded to the scene on MacGillis Drive. He violently attacked Liss, which lead to her firing her gun at Musson, according to a report released in July by Lake County States Attorney Michael G. Nerheim. At one point during the attack, Musson, who was 6 feet tall and weighed 190 pounds, charged the officer, who is 5-feet 5-inches tall and weighs 155 pounds, and slammed his body into hers, which then knocked her to the sidewalk. Nerheims findings concluded that Liss only fired her gun and shot Musson after she determined her life, and the life of a witness who came to her aid, were in danger.  More via the Daily Herald",0

"Members of the Portsmouth Fire Department often spend as much time out on the water saving lives as they do in the towns neighborhoods. On Tuesday, for example, crews responded to three marine incidents, including one involving a juvenile alone on a sailboat adrift in the waters off Common Fence Point. According to Portsmouth Fire Department Dep. Chief Michael P. OBrien, crews were just finishing an earlier incident when the department got a report of a sailboat adrift with a juvenile on board alone. Members of the Bristol and Portsmouth Fire Departments along with the U.S. Coast Guard responded at around 3:28 p.m. and located the boat about 10 minutes later. The child was rescued and the boat was towed back to the shore. That incident occurred just after the department was notified that there was an inflatable raft adrift off Sand Point on Prudence Island. Concerned that a boater might have fallen out of the boat, Bristol, Portsmouth and Coast Guard responders began a search along the shore at around 2:58 p.m. in an effort to identify the owner. Eventually, they learned that the boat had been picked up by a commercial vessel. Ultimately, the boat owner was found and confirmed that it had blown away in the wind. People are asked to report situations where vessels have drifted away to local authorities or Coast Guard, as boats adrift in the bay are perceived as a sign of someone in distress and emergency responders must respond out to investigate, OBrien said. These responders are no longer available for any true emergency that may occur. Then, at around 3:52 p.m., Portsmouth Fire Dept. Lt. Lt. Mike Pinksaw saw a person in a small dinghy holding onto a mooring apparently in distress in the Sakonnet River, north of the Sakonnet River Bridge. Portsmouths Marine 2 diverted to that location and was able to help that individual. All units were cleared by 4:33 p.m. An engine company from Naval Station Newport covered Portsmouth during the water incidents.",0

"LOS ANGELES, CA — Two weeks after the LAPDs first-ever use of a sniper in a helicopter to shoot a suspect, the Board of Police Commissioners was briefed Tuesday on the criteria the department uses for implementing the tactic. LAPD Assistant Chief Beatrice Girmala, director of the Office of Special Operations, said the department first developed the ability to use SWAT snipers from a helicopter in 2004 and had come close to using it four times since 2012. But until May 8, the helicopters never left the ground. Specific criteria is needed for the LAPD to consider using the aerial platform, Girmala said, and there is a multi-layered command and control process implemented when the department makes the decision to use it. A SWAT sniper shot and killed burglary suspect Anthony Soderberg, 29, of Shadow Hills near the 11300 block of Alethea Drive after a standoff with LAPD officers. Police said Soderberg barricaded himself inside a home and shot at officers before being flushed out with tear gas and fleeing out the back of the residence, where he tumbled down a ravine before being shot. RELATED: LAPD Sniper Kills Suspect From Helicopter, A First In Department History Beck told the Los Angeles Times that the house was at the top of a hill, surrounded by brush and debris, which created a very difficult location for SWAT officers, contributing to the decision to bring in the officers trained to fire from a helicopter. The suspect definitely had high ground at all of the ground officers, was firing indiscriminately at them and actually fired at the helicopter, we believe, Beck said. According to Girmalas report, which the commissioners requested after the helicopter shooting, factors considered by the LAPD include if there is a crime of violence; if the incident presents extraordinary and challenging circumstances above and beyond what would normally be dealt with; and if the suspect is using an elevated platform, a challenging venue, or terrain to his or her advantage over officers, making traditional approaches by ground unsafe. Girmala also said the department would consider using the aerial platform on a suspect in a vehicle if weapons of mass destruction, explosives or superior weaponry was involved. The department also has a multi-layered approach to command and control when using the aerial platform, Girmala said, as the commanding officers of the Air Support Division, Metropolitan Division and Counter-Terrorism and Special Operations Bureau must all sign off on its use, as well as the incident commander on the ground. Girmala stressed that using the aerial platform is not pre-approved deadly force, and that the same policy on lethal force applies. City News Service; Photo by Mfield via Wikimedia Commons.",0

"LONG HILL, NJ — A Long Hill man has pled guilty to distributing child pornography after over 138,000 images were found on his computer, NJ Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal announced. William G. Camargo, 48, of Long Hill Township was arrested as part of Operation Safety Net, a multi-agency child pornography sweep last year. He pled guilty in Superior Court on Tuesday in a plea agreement; he is expected to be sentenced to six years in jail, and will have to register as a sex offender.. Camargo, an IT professional, hosted and shared child porn through a shared online folder, Grewal said. A Sept. 2017 search of his home and hard drives turned up 138,000 images of child pornography, and an additional 1.3 million files that have yet to be examined. Its not known how many of those files contain illegial images. Each time we arrest an offender like Camargo who has amassed a collection of tens of thousands of files of child pornography, it starkly reveals the extent of the market for these loathsome materials and the vast number of children who are cruelly abused and exploited, said Grewal. We will continue to devote the resources necessary to apprehend these offenders and send them to prison. Carmargo was one of 79 arrested last September in a large-scale operation. The operation was lead by the New Jersey Regional Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force of the New Jersey State Police, and involved the New Jersey Division of Criminal Justice, U.S. Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), all 21 County Prosecutors Offices, and numerous local police departments. We will continue to patrol the internet and conduct multi-agency investigations to arrest and prosecute offenders like Camargo who distribute child pornography, said Director Veronica Allende of the Division of Criminal Justice. We are determined to seek justice for the children who are victimized to create these repugnant materials and who are re-victimized perpetually on the internet. It is a sad fact that each year countless children around the world fall prey to sexual predators, their innocence forever stolen and exploited through these disturbing digital collections, said Brian Michael, Acting Special Agent in Charge, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Newark. The expert investigative skills that HSI brings to the forefront, in collaboration with our partner agencies, helped close the loop on this individual, and took a dangerous predator off the street and brought him to much deserved justice.

"In an effort to proactively address crime and also keep residents safe in Delaware County, District Attorney Katayoun M. Copeland has launched a countywide community camera partnership program for homeowners and businesses to register their camera systems. The announcement was made on the 1700 block of Ridegway Road in Haverford Township at the home of the first registrants in the new program. Through the District Attorneys Criminal Investigation Division, the program, known as DA DelCAM will provide a valuable tool in the fight against crime countywide. It will also serve as a proactive measure to ensure the safety of vulnerable residents and locate missing persons such as children and older residents. For law enforcement, video surveillance is one of the best forms of evidence and it is also a helpful tool in locating and protecting some of our most vulnerable residents, such as a child who may have wandered off or run away from home, someone suffering from drug addiction or mental illness, or an older resident who may be suffering from dementia who strays from their residence, Copeland said. Through this program, law enforcement will have the capability to know where cameras are located throughout the county and access footage quickly and solve crimes faster while also empowering the public to help law enforcement fight crime in their own community. Those who register their camera systems will get a letter from the District Attorney and DA DelCAM emblem to post to show they are participants. Sharing video surveillance systems with law enforcement is a great example of community-law enforcement partnerships and we believe this is a step forward as we investigate crimes in our community and work towards reducing gun violence, Copeland said. Delaware County residents and businesses are encouraged to register their surveillance cameras online through the District Attorneys secure website online here. Participation in the program is strictly voluntary and all information will be kept in a secure database which will only be accessed by verified members of law enforcement. Information provided to the Delaware County District Attorneys Office regarding camera systems will be used for official purposes only and cameras will only be accessed in person with the express consent of the owners. Information from registrants will be stored in a secure database where law enforcement can obtain information regarding video surveillance cameras throughout the county. Through the use of the portal, law enforcement will be able to identify the location of video surveillance cameras that may have recorded the crime and also events relevant to the investigation. As investigations progress, law enforcement would contact the cameras owner and request permission to access images to aid in the investigation. Residents are reminded that if they have witnessed a crime or believe a crime is in progress, they should always immediately contact local authorities by calling 911. For more information, and to securely electronically register a camera system, residents can visit the District Attorneys website online here. Image via Delaware County",0
"BOSTON, MA – A 58-year-old Haverhill man, already on federal probation for one robbery, was arrested and charged today with robbing a branch of Santander Bank in Boston in March. Gregory Carter, 58, was charged in a criminal complaint with one count of bank robbery and is scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court Thursday afternoon. According to court documents, on the morning of March 25, an individual entered a branch of the Santander Bank on Commonwealth Avenue in Boston and handed a teller a note indicating a robbery. The robber stated that he had a gun and repeatedly gestured to his pocket. During the robbery, the robber pulled down a face mask he was wearing and exposed his skin and a thin moustach. The teller handed the robber cash, which was later determined to be $6,129. The robber then exited the bank walking toward Beacon Street. Following the robbery, the teller described the robber to law enforcement officers as a 510 light-skinned black male wearing a dark hat, black ski mask, sunglasses, a black puffy jacket and blue latex gloves. Law enforcement officers reviewed images from exterior surveillance cameras and determined that the robber drove through the area in a black Ford Fusion sedan and parked on Beacon Street. Following the robbery, surveillance images also recorded the robber returning to the sedan and driving away. The description of the robber and the vehicle were disseminated to law enforcement. Three days later, a police officer, who was aware of the recent bank robbery, spotted a black Ford Fusion on Dudley Street in Boston. The driver, who matched the description of the robber, exited the vehicle and began to approach a Bank of America branch. When a Boston Police cruiser stopped in front of the bank, the individual turned around and returned to the vehicle. The officer queried the vehicles registration number and learned that it belonged to Carter. A criminal record check revealed that Carter is currently on probation for a prior bank robbery conviction in federal court. Officers began conducting an investigation and surveillance of Carter, who they allege matched the description of the individual who robbed the Santander Bank on March 25. In the prior case, Carter was sentenced to 151 months in prison followed by 36 months supervised release and $5,400 in restitution for the Aug. 24, 2001 robbery of the Sovereign Bank in Boston.",0

"A Media teen has been arrested after a brutal home invasion in which a 72-year-old woman was beaten, bound, and tossed in a closet, where she remained for four days, according to the Chester County District Attorneys Office. The suspect is a 17-year-old boy who was living at Devereux Brandywine, a behavioral health facility, the DA said. His identity is not being released by authorities because he is a minor. This juvenile engaged in a brutal attack on the victim, then showed callous disregard for her life, DA Tom Hogan said. (He) is lucky that the victim did not die. If the victim had not been found by her family, the defendant would be facing murder charges. The boy escaped from the facility on Feb. 22, and headed to an East Brandywine Township home on the 100 block of Creek Road in the early morning hours, according to the DA. The resident, a 72-year-old woman, was not at home between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m., and thats when the suspect burglarized the home, stealing credit cards, officials said. Later that night at around 7:30 p.m., as she walked back into her home, the 17-year-old attacked her from behind, the DA said. He strangled her as she fought back and said, Youll be with Jesus soon. The woman eventually passed out. He then covered her head with a shopping bag, and tied her arms behind her back with zip ties, duct tape, and cloth, the DA said. Then he tossed her into a storage space underneath the steps. That was Wednesday night. She stayed there, without food and water, until she was discovered on Sunday morning, Feb. 26, when a family member checked in on her. Authorities said the woman was rushed to Paoli Hospital, where she was treated for dehydration, malnourishment, and blunt force injuries sustained in the assault. She is going to survive, police said. The victim showed remarkable courage and resilience in surviving the ordeal, Hogan said. She is strong physically and mentally, and will recover with the help of her family. Police were able to trace the suspect because he used the victims stolen credit cards in Maryland. Store footage shows his face as he makes the purchase. Further evidence ties a pair of boots in his possession to distinctive footprints left at the scene. He was arrested on March 1 and charged with attempted homicide, robbery, burglary, aggravated assault, strangulation, and related charges, the DAs office said. Hogan added that they will move to have the suspect tried as an adult. A public detention hearing is set for March 3. Anyone who has any further information on this case should contact Chester County Detective Ben Martin at (610) 344-6866. Pictured above is the storage space in which the victim was held.

"NUTLEY, NJ — Nutley police say that a report of a suspicious package that later turned out to be a harmless, homemade battery charger spurred emergency measures at two local schools on Thursday. According to the Nutley Police Department, officers received an FBI alert about a suspicious package in the basement of a building on Franklin Avenue. Nutley police and fire crews, along with Essex County Sheriff officers, then took the necessary precautions to safeguard the community while they investigated the package.

Police shut down Franklin Avenue and the surrounding streets from 11:15 a.m. to 1:15 p.m. A bomb squad and an FBI task force then investigated the package, finding it to be nothing more than a device made by a resident to charge car batteries, Nutley police said.

"EAST BAY, CA – An inmate at the behavioral health housing unit at Alameda Countys Santa Rita Jail in Dublin who allegedly was killed by his cellmate on Tuesday was identified by sheriffs officials as 56-year-old Dat Thanh Luong of Union City. He had been scheduled to be taken to Napa State Hospital soon for a mental health evaluation, authorities said. Deputies at the jail, which is the sixth-largest jail in the country and currently houses 2,129 inmates, found Luong in his cell at Housing Unit 9 at about 8:50 a.m. Tuesday after other inmates told them that they heard a noise and he was lying on the floor, Sgt. Ray Kelly said. The deputies who spotted the victim discovered a grisly scene and Luong was pronounced dead at the scene, according to Kelly. The victims cellmate, who was covered in blood, tried to flee but deputies were able to tackle him and detain him after a brief struggle, Kelly said. The unit where Luong and the suspect, 73, were being held is a maximum-security unit for inmates with mental illness or behavioral problems. Authorities arent yet releasing the suspects name because theyre having trouble communicating with him, Kelly said. The suspect, who was arrested in Hayward last Thursday on suspicion of battery and making threats, is currently being held in an isolation cell away from the rest of the jail population while Alameda County prosecutors determine if hes mentally competent enough to be interviewed about the incident, according to Kelly. Luong was arrested in Union City in January on an assault with a deadly weapon charge, Kelly said. Luong and the suspect are both Asian men who have mental health issues and authorities dont believe the killing was racially motivated or gang-related, Kelly said. It appears that no weapons were used and authorities believe Luong was either strangled or beaten to death, he said. There were no indications that Luong and the suspect couldnt be placed together and theyd only been in the same cell for a few days, Kelly said. There only have been five inmate homicides in Santa Rita since the jail opened in 1989 and Luongs death is the first homicide there since 2008, according to Kelly. Most of the other inmate homicides also involved fights between inmates with mental health issues, Kelly said. --Bay City News/Image of victim via ACSO",0
"More than 180 women have accused massage therapists from the popular chain Massage Envy of sexual assault, and the company has repeatedly ignored the allegations, BuzzFeed News reported Sunday night. BuzzFeed cited court records, police reports and other complaints from women who reported being groped and penetrated by massage therapists at Massage Envy locations across the country. One of the victims, Susan Ingram, called her local Massage Envy an hour after therapist James Deiter allegedly groped her during a session in West Chester, Pennsylvania, and pleaded with the staff to bar him from giving massages. The manager at the store told Ingram that Deiter was in a session with another client and could not be disturbed. Deiter would later plead guilty to sexully molesting nine women while working at Massage Envy. In another case, Danielle Dick was assaulted in a Virginia Massage Envy in October 2015. Her therapist placed his hand over mouth as he inserted his fingers into her vagina, according to the report. Dick immediately reported it to the Massage Envy desk clerk, who insisted calling the police would not be necessary because it would be handled internally. Massage experts told BuzzFeed that even if workers do not know for certain that a client was sexually assaulted, they should encourage victims to file a formal complaint with law enforcement. Experts also told the website franchises should prominently display their reporting policies and hire specially trained consultants if theyre accused of a crime. But according to the report, in places where it is not required by law, Massage Envy does not compel its franchisees to notify law enforcement, even in cases of rape. In an email to BuzzFeed, a lawyer for Massage Envy said: We hold franchise owners accountable to our policies and, when we say nothing is more important to us than treating clients with respect and giving them a safe, professional experience, we mean it.

"The Barrington Town Council ratified three union contracts on Monday evening, Oct. 1, that will save taxpayers millions of dollars down the road. The votes were all unanimous, 5-0. The millions of dollars in future savings will come in a give back by the police and fire departments of other post-employee benefits (OPEB) -- medical insurance after retirement, in Barringtons case -- for new officers, firefighters and dispatchers. That liability was in the same breath as pension reform, said Town Manager Peter DeAngelis Jr., who negotiated the new contracts. We stopped the liability for all new employees. OPEBs will continue to place unsustainable fiscal demand on communities, DeAngelis said. Its a good deal for the taxpayers, he said. The OPEB give back is a big one. We are now ahead of the game, DeAngelis said. I dont think any other town in the state doesnt have an OPEB. DeAngelis said he got the opportunity to bring up the OPEB because of four vacancies in the fire department. Those positions would probably have been filled if he had waited to negotiate the contracts later. The new contracts are all for three years. They will go into effect next July 1. The unions now will have minimum staffing levels written into the new contracts, DeAngelis said, although both the police chief and fire chief are already maintaining those levels. The minimum staffing level in the fire department during the day is 4; it will rise to 5, although Fire Chief Gerald Bessett has been maintaining a minimum of 5 already, said DeAngelis. The minimum staffing level in the police department is 3 during the day and 4 at night and on weekends, DeAngelis said. Police Chief John LaCross has been operating with those levels since 2009. Wage increases for the police and fire unions will be 2 percent each year. And the police will receive new language relating to detail pay, DeAngelis said. The towns six dispatchers, who handle police and fire calls, will get 2.5 percent and 2 percent raises in the first two years and no increase in the third year. OPEB is already out of the contract for the public works union, DeAngelis said.",0

"CHICAGO, IL - A University of Chicago police officer shot a suspect in Hyde Park late Tuesday night.

"A Galloway man is among three men charged with distributing cocaine in Atlantic City in connection with a drug ring that marketed cocaine and designer drugs online and distributed them via the mail, Acting Attorney General John J. Hoffman said on Monday. Thomas White, 31, of Galloway, is charged with first-degree distribution of cocaine and second-degree conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Additionally, Benjamin DiPilla, 28, of Ocean City, is charged with second-degree distribution of cocaine and second-degree conspiracy to distribute cocaine; and 62-year-old Thomas Bullock, of Millville, is charged with first-degree distribution of cocaine and second-degree conspiracy to distribute cocaine. DiPilla allegedly was involved in the sale of more than half an ounce of cocaine to an undercover detective on Nov. 1, 2013 at a nightclub in Atlantic City. Bullock and White allegedly sold a total of eight ounces of cocaine to the undercover detective at the same nightclub four times between July 24 and Sept. 17, 2014. Operation Skin Deep began when a detective discovered the sale of cocaine while monitoring the activities of white supremacist groups in Atlantic City. The arrests of DiPilla, Bullock and White led to the first-degree racketeering indictment charging 12 men in connection with a drug ring that marketed cocaine and designer drugs online and distributed them via the mail. Investigators also allegedly uncovered a conspiracy by the alleged leader of that ring, Christopher Castelluzzo, and three other members of the enterprise to murder a former associate and his bodyguard. Castelluzzo, 31, of Lake Hopatcong, is charged with the first-degree crime of leader of a narcotics trafficking network, which carries a sentence of life in state prison, including 25 years of parole ineligibility. He, 34-year-old Luke Atwell, of Hamilton Township (Mercer County), 45-year-old Eric Rodriguez, of Cliffside Park, and 46-year-old Henry Bracy, of New York, New York, are are also charged with first-degree conspiracy to commit murder for allegedly plotting to murder a former associate and his bodyguard in a dispute over drugs and drug money. The men allegedly took a number of steps in preparation to kill the targeted victims, but the murders were never carried out. Atwell allegedly acted as a managerial partner for the ring. Rodriguez allegedly made bulk purchases of cocaine with Castelluzzo. Others indicted include: Castelluzzo, Atwell, Lapaix, Menier, Collado and Dre are also charged with first-degree distribution of cocaine or possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. Jose Ruvalcaba, 28, of Oxnard, Calif., is a tractor-trailer driver who was arrested with Khan by detectives of the Division of Criminal Justice in a parking lot off Union Turnpike in North Bergen on April 24, 2015. Detectives allegedly found about $1.2 million in cash in the trunk of Kahns Infiniti, wrapped in bundles with duct tape. It is among the largest cash seizures in New Jersey law enforcement history. Kahn was allegedly meeting with Ruvalcaba so that Ruvalcaba could transport the cash in his tractor-trailer as payment for cocaine. Khan and Ruvalcaba are charged in the indictment with first-degree money laundering and first-degree conspiracy to commit money laundering. Jamal Johnson, 30, of Baltimore, Md., is charged with second-degree conspiracy to distribute cocaine, along with 10 of the other defendants – all except Ruvalcaba. In addition, Johnson is charged with second-degree eluding for allegedly fleeing on April 17, 2015, when detectives attempted to stop his car after he allegedly bought cocaine from Castelluzzo at the Omni Loung nightclub in Passaic, which is owned by Castelluzzo and Atwell. The drug ring allegedly used that night club for its headquarters. The detectives called off their pursuit of Johnson, but Castelluzzo was arrested at that time at the Omni Lounge. A search warrant was executed at the club, resulting in the alleged seizure of two kilograms of cocaine and nearly 400 grams of the designer drug ethylone. Atwell allegedly marketed the rings drugs on the Internet, tracked and managed the gross receipts and expenses, dealt with customers, and kept an inventory of the remaining drugs. Lapaix allegedly helped procure drugs for the ring to sell and handled the packaging and shipping of drugs. Atwell allegedly would send computer files to Lapaix containing lists of orders, including screen-names of customers, their addresses, and the amount and type of narcotics that each customer ordered. It is alleged that, when Lapaix received the files, he and/or his workers, Collado and Dre, would weigh out the drugs, package them, create tracking information, and mail each of the orders. Atwell allegedly would ensure all orders were properly filled. Lapaix obtained the necessary supplies for packaging the orders and Atwell reimbursed Lapaix for the cost of the supplies. It is alleged that Lapaix and Castelluzzo, who also allegedly engaged in street-level narcotics sales, used several cocaine suppliers, including Garcia-Hernandez, Khan and Menier.  Search warrants executed at various locations yielded approximately a quarter of a million dollars in cash, diamond jewelry, gold bars, another quarter kilogram of cocaine, numerous rounds of ammunition, firearm silencers, cocaine testing, cutting and packaging materials, and related equipment. The indictments were obtained on Thursday, March 3, by the Division of Criminal Justice Specialized Crimes Bureau. They were not announced until today because detectives are seeking several defendants who remain fugitives. The attached image of Thomas White was provided by the Attorney Generals Office",0

"Police took a 20-year-old West Des Moines woman into custody after she reportedly scaled the wall of her apartment complex to reach her balcony and, after failing to gain entry, woke other residents as she attempted to break down the door in the early morning hours of March 30. West Des Moines Police Officer Aaron Swenson responded to a disturbance call in the 4900 block of Woodland Drive about 2:45 a.m. When he got there, the woman – who was later charged with public intoxication and taken to the Polk County Jail – was attempting to break down her apartment door with a chair. She reportedly told Swenson that it was her apartment, and she and her two friends were locked out. She thought her roommate was sleeping inside, but loud knocking reportedly failed to rouse her. Swenson wrote in his report that he repeatedly tried to quiet the woman, but she walked away about three times, stating This is ridiculous.  Given the choice of being quiet or going to jail, the woman turned around and put her hands behind her back, Swenson wrote, apparently presenting herself to be handcuffed. She was arrested and as Swenson and a reserve officer working with him that morning escorted her down the stairs, she reportedly began resisting and said that she had changed her mind and did not want to go to jail. I advised her to keep walking, but she would not listen, Swenson said. She continued to plead to not be arrested. Swenson wrote in his report that en route to the jail, the woman apologized for not listening to him and then fell asleep for the remainder of the trip.

"GLENDORA, CA — No matter where you are celebrating, its time to think ahead and make sure you get home safely. Kickoff on Americas favorite pastime is just about ready to start. For many football fans, when its time for Super Bowl LII, everyones a fan…and Fans Dont Let Fans Drive Drunk. The California Highway Patrol and Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department, Orange County Sheriffs Department and other local law enforcement agencies are huddling up with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for a special Fans Dont Let Fans Drive Drunk reminder to urge football fans across the nation not to drop the ball on this issue. In all states, drivers are considered alcohol-impaired if they have a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .08 or higher. Drunk driving can be deadly, and even small amounts of alcohol can impair judgement to make driving unsafe. In 2016, there were 10,497 fatalities in motor vehicle traffic crashes involving drunk drivers. Among the 10,497 alcohol-impaired-driving fatalities, 67 percent (7,052) were in crashes in which at least one driver had a BAC of .15, almost twice the legal limit. Be sure to have a game plan for the night so friends and family know who the designated driver is. We want to encourage folks to turn over their keys to a sober driver before they begin drinking, said OCSD Sgt. Brian Sims. Drunk driving can result in serious crashes, injuries or death. If you dont have someone designated to make sure folks get home safely, consider other ride options. There are many other ways to ensure a safe ride home besides relying on a friend. The options include using public transportation, calling a taxi, or using a rideshare program, such as Uber or Lyft. In addition, NHTSAs SaferRide Mobile App, available in the app store, is another resource to help fans who have been drinking find a sober ride home—by identifying their location and calling a taxi or a friend to pick them up. Sober designated drivers should be sure to carry the ball and refrain from drinking alcohol. Be sure your designated driver tweets @NHTSAgov during Super Bowl LII to be featured on NHTSAs National Wall of Fame. This Super Bowl weekend, be a team player and help keep impaired drivers from getting behind the wheel. Dont fumble! Designate your sober driver before the big game begins. And remember: Fans Dont Let Fans Drive Drunk. OCSD Photo",0

"SOUTH WINDSOR/VERNON, CT — A self-proclaimed pita bread tycoon who hailed from Vernon and ran a financing scheme out of a South Windsor business entity has entered a plea in a six-year-old fraud case, a leading prosecutor said. Deirdre Daly, United States attorney for the District of Connecticut, announced Thursday that Moshen Youssef, 27, formerly of Vernon, had entered a guilty before U.S. District Judge Janet Bond Arterton in New Haven to fraud offenses relating to a scheme to secure more than $3 million in funding for his purported pita manufacturing business. According to court documents and statements made in court, beginning in approximately October 2011, Youssef defrauded various banks, a corporate leasing and vendor finance company, and the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development, in a scheme to secure funding for equipment purchases for his company, Amoun Pita and Distribution LLC and other companies he controlled. According to its business plan, Amoun Pita was a bakery that manufactured pocket pita bread from a production facility in South Windsor. As part of the scheme, Youssef provided false information when applying for loans, lines of credit, lease financing and state grants, purportedly to finance the acquisition of new pita manufacturing equipment, other machinery and inventory related to his businesses, Daly said. The false information included documentation that inflated the assets and income of Youssef and his companies, Daly said. Fraudulent invoices were created purporting to document equipment purchases that, in fact, never occurred, she added. Youssef created marketing materials and websites for non-existent vendors to back up the claims, Daly said. Youssef s scheme resulted in more than $3 million in losses, Daly said. He entered a plea of guilty to one count of bank fraud, which carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 30 years, and one count of mail fraud, which carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years, Daly said. Youssef agreed to pay the lenders restitution in the amount of $3,209,603.17, Daly said. Judge Arterton scheduled sentencing for Jan. 18, 2018. Youssef, who has dual U.S and Egyptian citizenship, moved to Canada in 2014, case records show. On Oct 22, 2015, a grand jury returned a 14-count indictment charging him with various fraud offenses. He was arrested in Canada on March 1 of this year and has been detained since his arrest, Daly said. The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, with the assistance of the Quebec Provincial Police RELEX Unit, Montreal Police Service and Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

"MENLO PARK, CA — A fire ripped through a Menlo Park home late Thursday, but thanks to some quick-thinking neighbors and a fast fire department response, the structure was spared from total destruction, the Menlo Park Fire Protection District said Friday. The fire was first reported at 9:24 p.m. on La Loma Drive in the Sharon Heights area of Menlo Park, according to fire officials. The neighbors had first smelled smoke and thought it was a barb-q but upon further investigation when they went outside, they could see fire inside the two story home, the fire district said in a news release. Firefighters were at the scene within three minutes and found flames pouring out of the middle of the home, as well as on the second level. Complicating and challenging the firefighting efforts was exterior scaffolding which partially surrounded the large 6,000 square foot tri-level hillside home, which was under construction, according to the fire district. However, officials say they got to the scene just in time to prevent the blaze from growing out of control. We caught this fire just as it was starting to mushroom and expand into the upper floors of the building, Menlo Fire Battalion Chief Tom Calvert said. If it had been allowed to burn a few minutes more, the whole house would have been on fire due to the significant preheating and smoke propagation. By 9:47 p.m., the fire was under control. The combination of the neighbors timely discovery of this fire and the firefighters catching it just as it was about to spread into the upper floors, prevented this fire from completely destroying the house, Fire Chief Harold Schapelhouman said in a statement. The access challenges the firefighters faced due to the construction, didnt help, but they pushed past them. We are estimating that the damage to the structure is around $150,000 but could go higher based upon where the fire occurred and the damage it created within the first and second floor supporting members and the extensive smoke and heat damage throughout the building. Crews remained at the site until around 2 a.m. for full overhaul. The cause is under investigation. -- PHOTO 1:  Firefighters on Menlo Truck 1 cut apart a garage door so that other Firefighters can gain access to the fire in a room and stairway behind the garage.

"MIDTOWN MANHATTAN, NY — Diamonds arent the only expensive commodity being sold on West 47th Street. Fifty-five kilograms of cocaine, worth $2 million, was seized from a phony Diamond District jewelry business which turned out to be a front for a narcotics smuggling ring, the Special Narcotics Prosecutor for the City of New York announced Friday. Agents from the New York Drug Enforcement Task Force raided 21 Divine, located on West 48th street near Sixth Avenue, on Thursday after staking the business out and witnessing an alleged drug drop, prosecutors told Patch. One man, 26-year-old Junior Lopez-Pena, was arrested leaving the building after the drug drop and has been charged with criminal drug possession, prosecutors said. This brazen trafficking scheme involved the delivery of 55 kilograms of cocaine to a bustling commercial center in Midtown Manhattan during broad daylight. By disrupting the supply chain and seizing $2 million in narcotics we undoubtedly saved lives, Special Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget G. Brennan said in a statement. The state task force and the Los Angeles field division of the Drug Enforcement Administration set their trap in place on Wednesday after identifying three suspicious packages being sent to 21 Divine from a known Los Angeles-based drug front, another fake jewelry business called Sapphire, prosecutors said. After Lopez-Pena was taken into custody, state task force agents searched 21 Divines premises and recovered the 55 kilograms (121 pounds) of cocaine, prosecutors told Patch. An automatic money counter was also seized from the fake jewelry store, prosecutors said. DEA Special Agent James J. Hunt stated that the coast-to-coast drug operation is a sign that Mexican drug cartels may be trying to proliferate the streets of New York City with cocaine. Detectives from the NYPD also assisted the state and federal agents in the investigation, NYPD Commissioner James ONeill said. Despite deliberate efforts to conceal a coast-to-coast drug operation through a phony business front, these alleged drug dealers were taken down through the relentless investigative efforts of NYPD detectives and our federal partners in the joint Drug Enforcement Task Force, ONeill said in a statement.

More 1,000 shares of the Patch story on Facebook later, Kenney returned home just after midnight Saturday. He returned home safe, but left many in the community, who had been invested in the search, bewildered by his disappearance. With the encouragement of his dad, Joe Kenney offered this statement of apology: Id like to express my gratitude and thanks to my family, our friends, and the entire community for the enormous outpouring of love and support over these last few days. Id like to also thank everyone for all of the work undertaken on my behalf, especially the Orono Police Department. Im so sorry for the disruption and the anxiety that I caused. I made a rash decision, a mistake which I compounded by being out of contact with friends and family. I didnt appreciate the impact that my impulsiveness would have on my family and so many other people. I am terribly sorry for causing such concern, and I will take full responsibility for my conduct. I am so happy to be home here in Orono.",0

"Middletown, NJ - A fire broke out while a family was having breakfast Sunday morning in a home in the Belford section of Middletown Township. Volunteer firefighters responded to the home at 6 Crab Apple Lane at 9:05 a.m. Sunday. The residents were on the first floor having breakfast when they heard the smoke alarm go off upstairs, Middletown Township Fire Department Public Information Officer Dennis Fowler said.

"Bill and Dotty Yanett were watching Blue Bloods on television Wednesday night, when the serenity of their evening was shattered by an explosion seven doors down on 13th Street in Allentown. Windows blew out, dressers went crashing, pictures flew off the walls. It was surreal....like you were at war, said Dotty Yanett, as she sought refuge Thursday morning at in South Whitehall. Five people, including a four-month-old, were killed in the natural gas explosion. Bill Yanett, retired from his job as a bodyguard for Mack Trucks presidents, rushed to his back door to head outside. Had his roof collapsed from the weight of the snow? But the back door was jammed; he couldnt get out of his house. He ran to the front of the house and got outside. His wife, in her pajamas, stayed back. She ran upstairs, to the room where her great-granddaughter sometimes slept over. Thankfully, her great-granddaughter had not spent the night. But the room, was all trashed, she said. I just cried. Outside now, Bill Yanett could see the flames shooting from 544 13th St., just down the street. He ran to help a neighbor who lived closer to the explosion. With others, he helped smash a window to get inside. But the police and fire officials were there now and yelling for him to get out right now. These can blow at any time, he said authorities told him. Bill Yanett needed to get his wife. He rushed back to their home at 532 13th St. She grabbed her coat and shoes--finding glass inside them from the shattered windows. They left behind everything else, including their medicine and glasses. Bill Yanett got their car, and spotting two neighbors, picked them up too so they could all get out of the neighborhood. The fire marched toward their homes. This was like being in a war zone, said Dotty Yanett. You didnt know where to go. You didnt know what to do. Where could they go? Bill Yanett is an official at Christ Evangelical Church at 22nd and Tilghman streets. Since he had the key, he figured the two couples could head to the church. He called his pastor. Once at the church, Dotty Yanett rummaged through donated clothes to find pants and a shirt for her neighbor Ed to wear; he had left his house in just his nightclothes and a robe. The Yanetts and their neighbors eventually went next door to their pastors home, and they watched televised accounts of the explosion and ensuing fire. Bill Yanett left at one point to go to the American Red Cross staging area at Agricultural Hall at the Allentown fairgrounds, so that officials could know that he and his wife and his two neighbors had gotten out alright. By 6 a.m., the Yanetts were at the hotel in South Whitehall, where they will stay again tonight, courtesy of the hotel and the American Red Cross. Then, they will seek shelter with their daughter at her boyfriends home in Quakertown. I think the Lord was looking out for us, said Bill Yanett. The house can be rebuilt... Were thankful neither one of us was hurt. Bill Yanett said his 6-year-old great-granddaughter, who had a collection of dolls at the house, heard about the explosion from her mother. I would like to talk to Poppy but I dont want him upset, he said she told her mother. But she had a question, Are my dolls OK? The Yanetts, who had lived on 13th Street for 30-plus years, remember the 1994 Gross Towers explosion. They had been at a nearby diner when it happened, but they werent allowed in their home then because it was so close to the scene. They remember the nightmare of seeing people injured and evacuating there. Now their house was destroyed in the explosion and ensuing fire. This time, Dotty Yanett said, she wont be going back to 13th Street. Download the movie",0

"A Twin Cities man who survived the 2007 Interstate 35W bridge collapse is facing charges in connection to the Islamic State. United States Attorney for the District of Minnesota Andrew M. Luger announced Wednesday a criminal complaint charging Mohamed Amiin Ali Roble, 20, with conspiring to provide material support to the Islamic State. Roble is not in custody, and the complaint states that one of his co-defendants believes Roble is now in Syria. Three co-defendants were convicted at trial earlier this year. According to the complaint, Roble received approximately $91,654.22 from settlements related to injuries he suffered in the I-35W bridge collapse. Charges allege those funds financed Robles travel to Syria and have also been used to pay for the cars of fellow ISIS members. Roble was given the money when he turned 18. He was 10 when he was injured in the bridge collapse. In August 2014, Roble attempted to apply for a passport. Roble told the passport specialist that his plans were to travel to China that month and return to the United States in September. He also told the passport specialist that he planned to study in China. When asked at which school in China he was going to study, Roble mumbled indistinctly in response and could not be understood by the passport specialist, the complaint states. Roble was issued a passport on Aug. 26, 2014. According to the complaint, on Oct. 4, 2014, Roble and his mother flew from Minneapolis to China. Roble made six cash withdrawals of approximately $1,000 each from an ATM in Wuhan, China. The withdrawals were made from the account containing the funds Roble obtained from the bridge collapse settlements. In November 2014, Roble bought airfare and flew to Istanbul, Turkey. From Turkey, Roble called his mother and told her that he was in Turkey shopping and that he needed an airline ticket back to China, which she purchased for him, according to the complaint. Roble returned to China shortly thereafter. On Dec. 27, 2014, Roble again traveled to Istanbul, but this time he did not return. About that same time, in November 2014, the complaint states that four of Robles co-defendants attempted to travel from Minnesota to Syria to join ISIS, via New Yorks JFK International Airport. The four co-defendants were stopped by federal law enforcement agents at JFK from flying from New York to various destinations in Europe. One of these men, Abdirizak Warsame, was interviewed in January 2016 and told investigators he had seen photographs on social media of Roble in a desert setting. Warsame is also charged in connection to ISIS. In some photographs, Warsame says he saw Roble carrying a black ISIS flag; in others, he is carrying what appears to be an assault rifle. So far, 11 men from the Twin Cities have been charged with trying to help ISIS, according to the Justice Department. The Pioneer Press reported that prosecutors say the men were part of a group of friends in the Twin Cities Somali community who were inspired to join ISIS. In recent years, about 12 men have left Minnesota to join militant groups in Syria, according to the FBI. Image via Shutterstock",0

"UPDATED with correct number of the value of heroin: Authorities seized more than $14,500 in heroin during a Northport traffic stop and arrested a local heroin dealer during two separate drug busts this month, Northport Police say. A traffic stop in Northport led to the discovery of a large amount of heroin in a Middle Island mans car Saturday afternoon, police say. According to authorities, a Northport officer pulled over a 2015 Nissan for a traffic violation on Scudder Avenue at 2:35 p.m. when the officer noticed powder on the floor by the drivers feet and drug packaging materials throughout the car. It was also determined the license of the driver, identified as 26-year-old John Talavera, was suspended, police say. A subsequent investigation allegedly recovered 730 decks of heroin packaged for sale, 36 grams of loose heroin in a bag, $2,450 in cash, a hypodermic needle and assorted drug packing supplies. Police Officer Gregory Cerar conducted the traffic stop. Earlier this month, an East Northport man was arrested following the discovery of heroin, cash and drug paraphernalia inside his home during the execution of a search warrant, police say. Authorities were tipped off that Michael Larosa, 36, of Meadow Haven Lane, was allegedly selling heroin from his home, which spurred an investigation over a several-month period. Police say they observed Larosa participate in numerous drug transactions at his home and officers bought heroin from him on two occasions at the same location. A search warrant was executed at Larosas home on Tuesday, Aug. 10 at 6 a.m., and authorities allegedly seized: Larosa was arrested that same day and was charged with two counts of third-degree criminal sale of a controlled substance, third-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance (intent to sell), fourth-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance, seventh-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance and two counts of second-degree criminally using drug paraphernalia. Larosa was arraigned in First District Court in Central Islip and posted $15,000 bail. Talavera was charged with first-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance, third-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance (intent to sell), third-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance, criminal possession of a hypodermic instrument, second-degree criminally using drug paraphernalia, third-degree aggravated unlicensed operation, disobey stop sign, failed to signal a turn, uninspected vehicle and uninsured vehicle. Talavera was arraigned in Northport Village Justice Court. Bail was set at $39,300 bond or $19,650 cash, and he is being held at the Suffolk County Jail in Riverhead.

"The Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authoritys bus driver union voted to bring in an arbitrator in connection with the firing of a bus driver involved in a physical altercation with a passenger last year. Artis Hughes was fired Nov. 6 after an altercation witha female passenger that ended with an uppercut. A video of Hughes uppercutting a passenger in Beachwood went viral on the web. The RTA said that Hughes actions were not in accordance with the companys policies, and he has been charged with assault in connection with the altercation. The passenger, Shidea Lane, has also been charged with disorderly conduct. Amalgamated Transit Union Local 268 President William Nix said that the members approved the measure to seek arbitration unanimously. According to the union contract, this arbitration will be binding — so the third partys decision will stand. We would love for him to get his job back, said Nix. He should be made whole. He added that Hughes firing sent a bad message and was followed by other assaults on bus drivers. Anyone who wants to get away with something, you can just go out and attack a bus driver and you wont get caught and you wont get arrested. In October, the RTA reported that there had been 71 assaults on drivers in the past 5 years. Since then, there have been at least two more that local media has reported on, sparking safety discussions between the union and Cleveland City officials.

"ROUND ROCK, TX — A Round Rock man described by a local newspaper as having shared red carpets with celebrities and driven Bentleys is now on trial on charges of orchestrating several jewelry store robberies. Marvis Lewis, 40, is in U.S. District Court where he stands accused by local and federal investigators of recruiting an accomplice to steal diamonds, rings and watches from several stores in Austin and Houston during the years 2014 and 2015, the Austin American-Statesman reported. Lewis is further charged with orchestrating another jewelry store heist in Ohio, netting $548,000 in ill-gotten gains. Lewis was arrested in February 2016 and subsequently charged with 16 felony counts, including conspiracy to interfere with commerce by threats of violence, money laundering and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, the newspaper reported. He faces a minimum sentence of 82 years in prison if found guilty on all charges, according to the report. The trial in U.S. Judge Lee Yeakels courtroom is expected to take up to two weeks. Lewis is reportedly representing himself in the case, telling the jury he is innocent was already wealthy thus eliminating the incentive of thievery, according to the report. His Instagram account dubbed 02beauxta attests to his opulence and extravagant lifestyle, with photos of him at Oscar and Emmy award show parties, and taking selfies with the likes of Madonna, Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, Eddie Murphy and Derek Jeter. The Statesman noted that Lewis insistence on representing himself has complicated the already complex case involving some 14 robberies, particularly given his penchant for objecting to the prosecutors questions. And in his court asides, Lewis isnt exonerating himself well as the Statesman described one particularly testy exchange with the judge. Its pretty obvious you need a lawyer, Yeakel told the defendant, to which Lewis responded Its pretty obvious youre a crooked judge. >>> Read the full story at Austin American-Statesman Image via Shutterstock",0

"A Washington, D.C., man has died following a single-car crash Saturday night in Anne Arundel County that police say was likely caused by the drivers use of alcohol and driving too fast. The accident happened at Friendship Road near Boyds Turn Road in Friendship about 7:15 p.m. Saturday. Police say the vehicle, a white 2005 Acura, was eastbound on Friendship Road. Just east of the intersection with Boyds Turn Road, the vehicle went off the right side of the road and into the grass. Once in the grass, the driver lost control of the car, which re-entered the roadway and began to spin before it crashed. The driver of the Acura, Brian Gore, 33, of the 1300 block of Delaware Avenue SW in Washington, D.C., suffered critical injuries as a result of the crash. He was taken to Prince Georges Trauma by ambulance, where he died early Sunday morning.  The preliminary cause of this crash appears to be driver error, authorities say. Excessive speed and alcohol are factors in this crash. The Traffic Safety Section will complete the investigation.",0
"BELLEVUE, WA - A video of Bellevue police Tasing and arresting a black teen has been viewed over 4 million times online, and a leader of the local NAACP chapter told KING 5 that the use of force depicted in the video was excessive. Bellevue police Chief Steve Mylett is pledging to investigate the incident, however. The video was shared on Facebook by the gossip website Media Takeout. The video shows a group of officers informing the teen that he is going to get arrested. After a short back-and-forth with the teen, several officers move in to make an arrest, and appear to use a Taser as they place him in handcuffs. Mylett told KING 5 that the incident took place on Saturday at the Bellevue Square Mall. The teen had been banned from the mall, and officers were attempting to remove him for trespassing. Mylett also said the teen was a suspect in a car theft. In the moments before the video was taken, Mylett told KING 5, the teen had fled from police on foot. Comments on the video on Facebook criticize the officers response, in particular that it took so many police officers to subdue one person. Mylett is asking for patience while the incident is investigated. We cant ignore the facts that there are white police officers and a juvenile African-American male that are involved in this incident, Mylett told KING 5. Give us time to investigate this. Please dont jump to conclusions based on one minute and 47 seconds of an interaction. Image via Facebook",0

"LARKSPUR, CA – A student was arrested Friday morning on suspicion of making a bomb threat to Redwood High School in Larkspur last week, authorities said. A message was left on the schools confidential tip line Sept. 19 stating that there would be a bomb at the campus at 395 Doherty Drive that day, according to the Central Marin Police Authority. The call resulted in a school-wide evacuation and classes were cancelled for the remainder of the day.

"MINNEAPOLIS, MN — Twin Cities Metro Transit police officers checking fares on buses and trains vehicles have a routine: They board, announce tickets will be checked then go through the process from one end of the train to the other ensuring all passengers have paid their fares. On occasion, they will have officers from other agencies in tow. For more than a decade, members of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response team have been among those partner agencies, according to a news release. They are an extension of DHS security, members of the Transportation Security Administration or Air Marshals, that are often seen at airports and occasionally branch out to transportation in cities throughout the country. In the Twin Cities metro, the team works in conjunction with Metro Transit police officers and does no transit enforcement on its own. In addition to regular work with our officers, the members of this team will often be seen at special events in the Twin Cities metro, including Minnesota Vikings games. Transit officials say the collaboration with other agencies provides an understanding of Metro Transit officers work and an opportunity to strengthen partnerships so that Metro Transit officers can work with those agencies more seamlessly in the event of an actual emergency or during times of heightened security, like the upcoming Super Bowl. The occasional additional sets of eyes and ears on Metro Transit vehicles also helps to increase security on the trains and buses, working to ensure that thousands of riders and the members of the communities Metro Transit serves safely arrive to work, school and any number of destinations on a daily basis, officials say.

The driver was ejected from the vehicle, which had been reported stolen. His passenger was also injured. According to CHP Officer Mike Radford, the wreck was reported at 5:40 a.m. on the southbound side of Highway 111, south of Overture Drive, and involved a 1997 Ford Ranger.

"NASHVILLE, TN — Metro Police arrested two people suspected of tricking a box truck driver and robbing him and his passenger. According to an affidavit, a man was driving a box truck on Interstate 65 South Saturday when Timothy Preston and Thelma Travillion, travelling in a passing pick-up, caught his attention and motioned him to pull over. The driver, who had a passenger alongside, thinking that perhaps his rear door had come open, stopped on the Old Hickory Boulevard exit and says that Preston and Travillian stopped their pick-up truck in front of him. (For more updates on this story and free news alerts for your neighborhood, sign up for your local Middle Tennessee Patch morning newsletter.) The victim said the couple attached their trucks tow hitch to the box truck to immobilize it and, with Travillion posted as a lookout, Preston approached the man with his hand in his pocket, claiming to have a piece and ordering the driver to open the box truck. Disappointed that instead of valuable loot the box truck was just hauling a load of used tires, Preston allegedly took the victims cell phones and all the cash they were holding: $5. Travillion followed up by asking if, perhaps, they had more than $5 somewhere else, according to the complaint. The victims called police, who were able to track down Preston and Travillion, who allegedly admitted to the heist. Both are charged with two counts of aggravated robbery and vehicle theft.

"GOSHEN, NY — An Orange County man was sentenced July 27 for raping two teenage girls. Orange County District Attorney David M. Hoovler said Nicholas McAteer, 46, of Greenwood Lake, had pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree rape and was sentenced to 18 years in prison, to be followed by a period of post-release supervision. At the time of his guilty plea, McAteer admitted to raping the two girls. The first girl was raped in 2007 when she was 18 years old. The second girl was 15 years old when he raped her in 2011. The judgment entered against McAteer satisfies an 82-count indictment, involving a series of sexual offenses he committed against the two girls over a number of years. Hoovler said sex offenses are among the most despicable acts that people can commit against others and can often have profound adverse impacts on victims, especially young ones. In my office, we have made it a priority to treat sex offenses involving child victims very seriously, and will seek appropriate, and significant, sentences for those crimes, he said. Todays sentence will, hopefully, bring some measure of justice and closure to the young people that this defendant victimized, and to their families, Hoovler said. Image via Shutterstock.",0
"LA MESA, CA – Students, community members and activists marched from Helix Charter High School to La Mesa Police Department headquarters Wednesday to protest the actions of a police officer who twice slammed a handcuffed female student to the ground while arresting her last week at the University Avenue campus. Video of the rough law enforcement encounter emerged on social media over the weekend, sparking a student walkout Monday morning protesting the treatment of the 17-year-girl. The teen sustained scratches on her face during the scuffle on Friday afternoon but did not require hospital care due to the encounter, authorities said. La Mesa police officials have promised to conduct a thorough review. On Tuesday, the department announced that the involved lawman, school-resource Officer Scott Wulfing, was reassigned to another division and would not work on any campuses pending completion of an internal investigation. Wulfing has been a member of the agency for nine years, LMPD Lt. Chad Bell said. Aeiramique Blake, a community organizer serving as a spokesperson for the family of the arrested girl, contended that temporarily reassigning the officer was not enough. Were asking that he is suspended, Blake said in a Facebook video, noting that Wednesday afternoons protest march was meant to put police on notice -- we know the officer was reassigned, not suspended. During the earlier school walkout, Blake said Wulfing never needs to work with kids again. In her social-media video, she called for Helix High and all other area secondary schools to eventually pull all resource officers off campus. She also called on the countys top prosecutor to review the incident. (District Attorney) Summer Stephan, we will come for you if you do not press charges against this officer, Blake said. The clash between Wulfing and the student, according to La Mesa police Chief Walt Vasquez, happened after a Helix High staffer called police for assistance to deal with the student, who was suspended and refused orders to leave the school grounds. Wulfing tried in vain to get the girl to leave voluntarily before forcibly tackling and handcuffing her, Vasquez said. As they were walking, the student became non-compliant on two separate occasions and made an attempt to free herself by pulling away from the officer, the chief asserted in a prepared statement. To prevent the student from escaping, the officer forced the student to the ground. The Facebook videos show Wulfing twice throwing the girl across his body from left to right and onto the concrete-paved ground. Following the first slam, the girl appears to lean away from the officer, after which he throws her down again and pins her with his upper body for several seconds, then rolls her to her side and pulls her to her feet. After the student agreed to quit resisting and attempting to escape, the officer assisted her up and walked her to his patrol vehicle, Vasquez said. Blake disputed the official rationale for the arrest, saying the girl had been allowed to be on campus while assigned to in-school suspension for tardiness issues. According to Blake, a teacher accused the girl of being intoxicated, then searched her backpack, finding no drugs but discovering pepper spray, which the teen said she carried for protection. The instructor told her shed have to leave campus because she was carrying a weapon, then called the police when she refused, Blake said. No matter what was done or not done, that was not the appropriate way to handle a young lady, Blake said. The community is completely outraged. The school is expected to hold a community forum before the end of the month.    RELATED: By City News Service Photo via YouTube screenshot",0
"A judge sentenced an 18-year-old Colts Neck man to a 15-year prison term for stabbing a woman inside her Colts Neck home, authorities said. Brennan Doyle, was 16-years-old when he repeatedly stabbed the woman in 2013, but a judge ruled he could be tried as an adult. Doyle, who is now 18, admitted he repeatedly stabbed the victim in her Colts Neck home with the intent of killing her before fleeing the home in the victims motor vehicle, a news release from acting Monmouth County Prosecutor Christopher J. Gramiccioni said. Doyle must serve at least 12 years, 9 months before he can be eligible for parole. Upon release, he must serve three years on parole, under the terms of the sentence handed down Thursday by state Superior Court Judge Ronald Lee Reisner, sitting in Freehold. In court, his attorney, Mitchell Ansell, said his client had no prior convictions and has since received drug treatment, but that night he took too many hallucinogenic mushrooms, NJ.com reported. Around 12:30 a.m. July 7, 2013, the victim called Colts Neck police and said she was stabbed by someone she did not know, according to the news release. I could taste, see and hear the blood pouring out of my body, the woman said in court, according to NJ.com. It was an absolute nightmare. When she was brought to the hospital, she was listed in critical condition. She was hospitalized for several days, authorities said. The woman lost about half of the blood in her body, Monmouth County Assistant Prosecutor Laurie B. Gerhardt, Director of the Offices Family Division, said in court, according to NJ.com. Investigators from the Monmouth County Prosecutors Office and Colts Neck police determined the victim heard a noise outside, and when she opened the door to investigate, Doyle forced his way in, stabbed her and left her for dead, authorities said. He took her car keys and stole her vehicle, which was recovered later that morning in Aberdeen.",0

"For most people, the closest theyll ever get to a taser is watching an episode of COPS or YouTube. Probably for good reason – a police-issued taser shoots fishhooks containing 5,000 volts of electric shock through human skin, said Sumner officer Loren Houselog to the students of the Sumner Police Citizens Academy. The hooks can penetrate heavy jackets and jeans and suspects ride the volt for an excruciating 5 seconds per hit. The bigger they are, the more effective the charge. Tasers are used to restrain criminal suspects and can stop them from fleeing police custody – the darts shoot out on wires that run 25 feet. Every officer on the force carries one, except parking control. Houselog showed a Powerpoint demonstration on tasers (complete with clips from the Hangover) that sparked giggles around the classroom. Then, it was time for the live demonstration. Sumner Sgt. Jeff Engle had never been tased, so he wanted to experience it before he retires, he said. He wore a white SUMNER COPS T-shirt to show off the blood he expected to spurt from his back and stood on a wrestling mat -- just in case. Then, the shot. To be honest, I dont know what Jeff said when he fell. I played it back 100 times and still cant figure it out. So, I leave it up to you to interpret. Please watch responsibly. Download the movie",0

Officer Milton came to learn that the girl was the eldest child of four, with the youngest being a newborn. The mother told the officer that she didnt work because she couldnt afford day care; her husband frequently works out of town but for little pay. Inside the home, there was hardly any food, not enough beds for the kids and the only furniture was an old couch.

"Now that school has started, drivers need to remember to follow a few rules of the road that have had the summer off along with students in New Jersey. And forgetting those rules — and being caught doing so — could carry stiff penalties for motorists or, even worse, cause a serious accident. When it comes to buses, school zones and safety, some of the biggest concerns happen when cars and buses arent even moving. Kids run the greatest risk of being hurt when theyre standing at the bus stop, according to school officials. In fact, most children between the ages of 5 to 7 are injured or killed while theyre getting on and off the bus, and they enter an area that the Illinois State Board of Education has ominously labeled the Death Zone. Heres what you need to know — and what you should do — when you see a bus stopped with its flashing lights and extended stop-sign arm, or you are driving by a school: The Law: In New Jersey, the driver of a vehicle approaching a school bus must stop no less than 25 feet from vehicle. The driver must stay stationary until each child has entered the bus. The driver also must stay stationary until each child exiting the bus has reached the side of the road, and until a flashing red light is no longer exhibited by the bus. On highways having dual or multiple roadways separated by safety islands, the driver of a vehicle on another roadway approaching a school bus must reduce the speed of his vehicle to no more than 10 miles per hour, and cannot resume normal speed until the vehicle has passed the bus. The car cant resume normal speed until the car has passed any child exiting or entering the bus. The Penalty: First-time offenders are subject to fines of not less than $100, imprisonment for not more than 15 days or community service for 15 days. The Motor Vehicle Commission may also revoke the license to drive a motor vehicle of any person found guilty. The Law: Under state law, the speed limit for school zones typically is 25 mph, regardless of what the speed is for the road the school is on. Local authorities, however, may by ordinance designate a reasonable and safe speed limit that is less than or greater than 25 mph after an engineering and traffic investigation. The Penalty: For most speeding violations, the motorist faces up to 15 days in jail and/or $50 to $200 in fines. And for willful speeding violations—meaning the driver was knowingly breaking the law—license revocation is possible. Fines are, however, double for speeding offenses where the driver exceeded the posted limit by 20 miles per hour or more (or ten miles per hour or more in a 65 mile-per-hour zone).

"Boston officials are questioning whether a lapse in fire escape inspections along Beacon Street in Boston may have contributed to a massive Back Bay fire in March that resulted in the death of two Boston firefighters.

Ed Walsh and Firefighter Michael Kennedy in late March, was conducted in 2004, according to MyFoxBoston.

"ALBANY, NY — A push to ban sex between police officers and people they arrest got support from Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday. Cuomo said he plans to include a provision classifying such sexual encounters as inherently nonconsensual in his state budget legislation. State law currently says prison inmates cannot legally consent to sex with correction officers or parole officers, but that law doesnt apply explicitly to police officers and people in their custody. There must be zero tolerance for sexual abuse and harassment across the board, and especially among those in positions of authority, Cuomo, a Democrat, said in a statement. This common sense reform closes an egregious loophole and helps protect against abuse in our justice system. City and state lawmakers have pushed for such a law since a then-18-year-old woman from Brooklyn accused two NYPD cops, Richard Hall and Eddie Martins, of raping her while she was handcuffed in a police van in September. Hall and Martins are facing criminal charges, but argue the sex was consensual. Legislators and advocates argue the power dynamics between cops and civilians — especially when theyre under arrest — preclude real consent in such cases. NYPD policy prohibits having sex on duty but its not technically illegal. The state Assembly unanimously passed a bill Feb. 5 that would make it a felony for a cop to have sex with a person whos been detained, arrested or otherwise in police custody. The bill is now under consideration in the state Senate. In this particular instance its something thats so clear that needs to be done that its not surprising that it passed unanimously, Assemblyman Edward Braunstein (D-Queens) told NY1s Capital Tonight on Monday. City Councilman Mark Treyger has proposed a local law that would make the same crime a misdemeanor in New York City. (Lead image: Photo by BravoKiloVideo via Shutterstock)",0

"You might say a Washington State Trooper always gets his bike. Last week, a state trooper spotted a bike he had recently sold on-line to a college student on Capitol Hill in Seattle -- inside a suspicious vehicle another trooper found partially blocking a road in Shoreline. The bike had, in fact, been stolen just days after the trooper sold it, and he subsequently confiscated it and returned it to the rightful owner. It all started on the morning of April 25, when a state trooper arrived at a disabled vehicle that was partially blocking State Route 523 (NE 145th) near 12th Avenue NE in Shoreline. According to Trooper Julie Judson, WSP spokeswoman, the driver, a 34-year-old Seattle man, was hurriedly attempting to change a tire on the car, a black Honda Accord. The trooper on the scene noticed a bicycle in the car with its serial numbers ground off, along with a grinder and a Ruger handgun, all clearly visible inside the car. Soon another trooper arrived to assist, and immediately recognized the bike by scratches on the frame. He had sold that bike just weeks earlier to the student. The driver merely claimed it was his bike. But the trooper called the student he had sold the bike to, who confirmed it had been stolen just days after he bought if from the trooper. The bike was later returned to the rightful owner. And the driver was booked into the King County Jail for investigation of being a felon in possession of a firearm.",0

"How do you talk with your children about the Sandy Hook school shooting without traumatizing or frightening them? Thats the question Clawson parents are sure to be asking themselves and one another in the wake of Fridays tragedy. What do you tell them? How much detail to you tell them? How do you help them make sense of what they may already have heard from friends or on television, or read via social media? Lauren Hutchinson, MA, LMFT, is a nationally-recognized child and family therapist and parenting coach with a practice in Bellevue, WA. She says the first step is for parents is to turn off the TV. We dont want to have the TV playing in the background all the time. It isnt helpful and the news is traumatizing for kids to watch.  Here are other age-appropriate tips: Ages 7 and younger: Hutchinson says, you want to shield them from the media coverage completely and parents should not initiate a conversation about the event because kids this age cannot make sense of what has happened. Kids dont need to know the specific details of the event, like that the shooter was dressed all in black. We forget that children, especially ages seven and younger, hold tight to those kinds of negative images, she says. Ages 7 to 12: Hutchinson says, you might provide them with basic information and reassure them. The most important thing for kids this age is to know that they are safe. Talk about how parents and school teachers and staff work hard to protect kids and do tell them that the police got the bad guy, she says. Hutchinson encoureages parents to read the childs cues and let them bring up what he or she wants to talk about. Hutchinson says it is important for parents to not invalidate feelings and remember kids will take their cue from your responses. While we may be feeling weepy or mesmerized by the TV coverage, we need to remember our kids are watching us.  She says that like all parents, she is curious about many details of the case but will wait until after her kids are asleep to go online and read the news coverage. Telling her own children: Hutchinson says she will approach the conversations differently with her two boys because of their ages. My 7th grader will have access to friends with smart phones and may have already heard about the event, she says. With him Im going to answer questions, not rehash the event, and respond to specific questions and concerns he has. With adolescents, there is an opportunity to talk in greater depth and have a conversation about what happened, what might make someone do something like this, etc. With my 10-year-old, I will tell him what happened in brief, non-descriptive language. Something really terrible happened at a school in Connecticut today. A gunman shot some students and adults. Many families and the community are heartbroken over the senselessness of this act, She says. Then I am going to hone in on him and his response. This may be enough information for him; other kids may seek greater detail. Either is okay. Be honest and direct, without too many details.One of the most helpful things parents can do for their children, now and in the weeks ahead says Hutchinson, is to take action. (Children) need a meaningful way to express their emotions and process what happened. For her own children, her family will be lighting a candle and saying a prayer for the victims and their families. Rituals are important, especially during times like these, for comfort and healing.

"Six former Hopkins priests are on a list of priests credibly accused of sexual abuse of minors in the archdiocese (of St. Paul and Minneapolis), according to the archdioceses newspaper. The priests on the list are: The Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis published the list of 34 priests Thursday in the online edition of The Catholic Spirit, the newspaper that serves the archdiocese. About half of the parishes in the archdiocese—92 out of 188 parishes—had one of the priests on the list there at some point, according to the archdiocese. The publication was made in response to ongoing lawsuits against priests and the church arising from childhood sexual abuse cases. The archdiocese and Diocese of Winona originally sought to seal the list—which was created in 2004 and included 33 of the 34 priests named today, according to the Star Tribune. The courts agreed to seal the list in 2009. But Archbishop John Nienstedt reversed course after the church was accused of shielding priests—allegations that gained extra fuel in recent months from a Minnesota Public Radio exposé. The information being released comes mostly from reported incidents that occurred between the mid-1950s and 1980s, according to The Catholic Spirit. All have been permanently removed from ministry or are deceased, the article said. The church says it is engaged in a comprehensive review of clergy files and will update the list as it makes additional announcements.",0

More from Farmington Police: As many as 50 law enforcement agencies including state and local police will take part in the mobilization to enforce Connecticuts tough law that prohibits motorists from texting and/or using hand-held cell phones while driving. The crackdown will span the entire month of April. During a similar, three week campaign last September, over 7,000 motorists received a citation for using their phone while driving. In 2013, 3,154 people were killed and an estimated additional 424,000 were injured in motor vehicle crashes involving distracted drivers. According to a 2014 special article in the New England Journal of Medicine, the risk of a crash or near-crash among novice drivers increased with the performance of many secondary tasks, including texting and dialing cell phones. Police will be keeping an especially close eye out for drivers who text and drive. Texting and driving requires motorists to take their eyes off the road, hands off the wheel, and mind off the task of driving. It creates the proverbial perfect storm for a crash, and no one has the right to put another persons life at risk like that, said Sgt. Jason Raines. Connecticut remains the only state in the nation to receive special distracted driving prevention funds – the same funds that allow for special patrols to identify, stop and cite drivers who choose to ignore distracted driving laws. Over $4.6 million dollars has been awarded to the state over the last two years specifically – to fund campaigns like this one. Connecticut qualifies for this federal funding source through a mix of tough laws – and, a proven track record in strong enforcement of distracted driving laws. Its not that complicated: if you text and drive, we will see you, pull you over, and fine you. Were serious about enforcing texting laws, said Sgt. Jason Raines.

"The trial of Michael Thomas, the former chairman of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation who is accused of stealing more than $100,000 from the tribe, begins Monday. Patch reported earlier that, federal investigators charge that Michael Thomas stole more than $100,000 while serving as the chairman of the tribal council. According to the United States Attorneys Office, The indictments also include forfeiture allegations.  If convicted Michael Thomas faces forfeiture of $102,393.34 and two personal computers. Federal prosecutors are concerned that Thomas will blame his former accountant, F. Robert LaSaracina of Norwich, for his alleged offense. The Day reported that LaSaracina pled guilty in 2011 to federal fraud and tax charges and hes serving a 63-month prison term. The report also says that Thomas may use an everybody-is-doing-it defense and offer evidence that other tribal members used the tribe issued credit card for personal expenses. Prosecutors claim that Thomas charged Direct TV satellite service, cell phone service and personal transportation costs to the card, according to another report on The Day. Thomas brother Steven Thomas also faces trial for similar charges but his trial wont begin until November. Federal prosecutors allege that Steven Thomas stole more than $700,000 while he was assistant director of the natural resources department and if convicted he faces forfeiture of approximately $739,743.64, and two personal computers.

"Fred Thompsons pool has been a popular spot this year, but not only for friends and family looking for a relaxing afternoon. A car crashed through his fence and into the pool Tuesday — for the third time this year. This is ridiculous, Thompson told Fox5. Three times in one year? A female driver made a left turn off of Route 125 but lost control of her car in the pouring rain. Instead of turning onto Paradise Valley Rd., she plowed her Mitsubishi Monterro through the fence and into Thompsons backyard pool. A woman and her baby were inside the home at the time of the accident. She called Thompson, her father, who owned the home. Thompson rushed home from work, but not too quickly, lest he become the fourth driver to plunge into his pool this year. When my daughter called me, she was nervous, crying, Thompson told Fox 5. I wanted to haul it at 70, but common sense, drop it down to 50 because the roads slick. The woman was taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. It took a tow truck 45 minutes to retrieve the submerged vehicle.",0
"A Lakeville couple who left their German shepherd at a kennel in Rosemount for a weekend in October and returned to find that the dog had been hit by a motorcycle and had to be destroyed have filed a claim against the kennel and its owner. Peter and Patricia Fahnlander filed the claim in Dakota County Conciliation Court against theLazy Leash in Rosemount and its owner, Jo Hall, alleging that Hall or someone who works for her negligently allowed their dog Sheba to run into traffic. David Hellmuth, an Edina attorney who is advising the Fahnlanders in the case, said he volunteered to help when he heard their story. Its just so wrong, said Hellmuth, who is a business partner of Peter Fahnlander. This is a very personal and sad, tragic situation. The dog was part of their family. Hellmuth said the Fahnlanders visited the Lazy Leash a few weeks before their planned trip to make sure it had appropriate accommodations for their dog. They dropped off Sheba on Oct. 12, a Friday, and went to northern Minnesota for the weekend. When they returned home on Sunday evening, they went to the kennel to collect Sheba. Jos boyfriend was there, and basically apologized to Peter, Hellmuth said. He said, Yep, you know what, I screwed up. I tied the dog up rather than putting her in the fenced area. The dog must have chewed the leash, and the dog ran away. A stunned Fahnlander asked when Sheba had escaped, and the man at the kennel told him that it happened two days earlier – the day they dropped her off. Fahnlander asked why nobody had called him, and said he would have returned to the Twin Cities immediately to look for the dog, according to Hellmuth. The man at the kennel told Fahnlander that someone had called Rosemount police on Friday to report the dog missing. So Fahnlander began calling around to local police departments. When he spoke to Rosemount police, he discovered that Sheba had run into traffic and had been hit by a motorcycle. Her injuries were so serious that she had to be destroyed. When Peter told me what happened, I told him Id write the woman a letter, Hellmuth said. I love animals, and this is a ridiculous situation. Hellmuth sent Hall a demand letter, asking her to pay compensation to the Fahnlanders. When he called her to follow up, she claimed not to know what he was talking about, telling him that she had no paperwork proving that the dog was at her kennel. At that point, Hellmuth prepared a conciliation court action for the Fahnlanders. The law is such that a dog is considered personal property, he said. You cant get emotional distress damages, or wrongful death damages. But I could do this much for them. Halls legal woes might not end with the conciliation court action. After Hellmuth filed the action on the Fahnlanders behalf, he got a call from Lakeville attorney Art Kosieradzki, who is representing the motorcyclist who hit Sheba and was injured in the crash. My client was just minding his business, driving down the road, when this dog ran out in front of him, Kosieradzki said. Its lucky the dog didnt kill him. Hall, contacted by phone, she didnt know anything about the conciliation court action, and continued to deny that Sheba had ever been at her kennel. If theres no paperwork, the dog was not here, Hall said. There was no dog, no paperwork, no nothing. Hellmuth called Halls attitude unconscionable, and Kosieradzki agreed. Shes got this goofy story that the dog wasnt there, he said. We will ultimately get to the bottom of it, Ill tell you that. I dont know where she thinks shes going to get by saying the dog wasnt there. The Fahnlanders conciliation court claim is for $2,643, which includes court costs and the cost to have Shebas remains cremated. According to court documents, Sheba was valued at $2,450. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Dec. 11 in Apple Valley.",0
"Long Valley, N.J. – A Washington Township resident pointed an assault rifle at three boys allegedly making too much noise outside the mans residence Thursday night, police announced. At 7:10 p.m. three juveniles reported to Cpl. David Marut and Officer Frank Giaquinto of an altercation they had with a man roughly 30 minutes earlier in Hasting Square, Lt. Doug Compton said. The boys told officers that one of the kids sneezed outside of a residence and a man approached them and told them to stop making noise, Compton said.

"DARIEN, CT — Three Darien residents reportedly were victims of separate bank fraud cases, prompting investigations by local police. In the first case, reported on June 7, a 51-year-old man lost $2,482.05 from his bank account in a larceny via wire fraud. The victim in this case reported that he had wired $2,482.05 from his [Citibank] bank account on 06/07/2017 to a Luis King who was using a United Bank of Charleston, SC bank account, wrote Darien police in a statement. The victim reported that he had been in contact with a Cory Hopper via texts and emails concerning an apartment rental, purportedly located at 101 Park Square in Stamford, over approximately a months time. The correspondence was the result of a Craigslist posting advertising an apartment rental. The victim stated he decided to wire the money on 06/07/2017 as he was being pressed for time by Cory Hopper on potentially losing the apartment rental. After wiring the money, the victim decided to call the leasing office at 101 Park Square in Stamford directly and found that there was no Cory Hopper or Luis King employed or known to anyone there. He also learned that Stamford PD had been notified by other potential victims of this apparent scam as well. The victim then called his bank in an effort to stop the wire transfer. The investigation is ongoing, and both banks have launched their own investigations, according to police. It was not disclosed if the victim was able to successfully stop the wire transfer. Once again, the Darien Police Department strongly cautions our residents to weigh all aspects of any online or wire transactions thoroughly and to fully consider all potential transactions with a high level of due diligence, wrote police. Sending or wiring money sight unseen or transacting business with unknown parties over the internet is many times a likely recipe for a significant loss. In the second case, reported on June 8, a 38-year-old resident reported to police that numerous transactions totaling $500 were fraudulently charged to his Wells Fargo Bank account, in what police described as a case of identity theft. Fraudulent charges were made at Target, Amazon and Paypal, wrote police. The resident did not suffer any monetary loss as the bank is reversing the charges and have opened their own investigation. There was no evidence of local criminal activity. Finally, on June 11, a 38-year-old Flushing, NY woman was arrested on numerous fraudulent credit card charges after she allegedly tried to use fake credit cards at a Peoples United Bank branch on Heights Road, according to Darien police. Officers were dispatched to the scene at about 11:15 a.m. after bank security notified police that a woman was trying to use fake cards at the banks ATM. Upon arrival, officers observed a white female, wearing a black shirt and red pants, in the ATM vestibule, wrote polie. The female was asked to step from the vestibule area. She was wearing what appeared to be a dark wig and dark sunglasses. The suspect, Gabriela Enache, was extremely nervous and would not answer basic questions posed by responding officers as to what she was doing at the bank and where she was coming from. Officers observed that Enache was holding an open wallet containing a large amount of cash and a large number of credit and/or gift cards. Ten Visa and American Express branded cards were recovered that, through the assistance of members of the Connecticut Financial Crimes Task Force, were confirmed to be fraudulently cloned cards. Arrested was Gabriela Enache who was charged with the following: Police also recovered more than $1,500 from Enaches wallet, all in twenty dollar bills which is the specific denomination dispensed by most ATM machines. Enache was held in lieu of a $150,000 bond and is scheduled to appear in Stamford Superior Court later this month. The investigation into this incident is continuing. Image via Shutterstock",0

"REDWOOD CITY, CA – A 21-year-old gang member convicted of first-degree murder for the 2015 fatal shooting of a man at a house party in Half Moon Bay was sentenced to 53 years to life in prison Thursday, according to San Mateo County prosecutors. Abraham Ramirez Arroyo, of Redwood City, received the maximum sentence allowable under state law, and Judge Mark Forcum said that nothing less was deserved for the crime, which occurred around 8:30 p.m. on Aug. 29, 2015. Arroyo and his co-defendant, 37-year-old Armando Carranza of Hayward, summoned 21-year-old Felix Garduno-Vega out into the front yard and Arroyo shot him with a .380-caliber handgun after an argument, prosecutors said. They fled in Carranzas vehicle. Carranza surrendered Sept. 1, 2015, and Arroyo was apprehended in Visalia Sept. 8 after a police pursuit. The murder weapon was found in his vehicle, according to the district attorneys office. On Feb. 27 of this year, Arroyo was found guilty of first-degree murder and felony evading with enhancements for use of a firearm and gang affiliation. In addition to his prison sentence, Arroyo was also ordered to pay a $10,000 fine and $5,000 restitution to the victims family for funeral expenses, prosecutors said. Carranza was found guilty of second-degree murder with enhancements for use of a firearm and gang affiliation. He was sentenced in April to 40 years to life in prison. Judge Forcum called the case an indictment of gang culture in San Mateo County, according to prosecutors. – By Bay City News Service / Image via Shutterstock",0

"Three people were sentenced today for their roles in two 2004 murders for which the gunman is expected to land on death row. Jose Resendez, 37, and Bernadette Corvera, 32, were both sentenced to 15 years to life behind bars. Both defendants pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and robbery counts -- Resendez for the San Gabriel killing of Dianqui Wu, and Corvera for the shooting death of 22-year-old Pasadena City College student Joseph Molina. Mitzie Ann Oso, 35, who pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in both killings, was given an eight-year term but was expected to be released later today. Shes been jailed since her arrest in 2005 and has already served more days than required by her sentence, according to Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ronald S. Coen. All three defendants negotiated plea deals with prosecutors and testified at the trial of Leonardo Cisneros, who was convicted May 7 of first- degree murder for shooting Molina during a Dec. 10, 2004, heist at a Subway sandwich shop in Whittier, along with the Aug. 4, 2004, shooting death of Wu. The 50-year-old Rowland Heights man was shot, despite agreeing to turn over his money before he was killed in the 1800 block of South Del Mar Avenue. Jurors found true the special circumstance allegations of murder during the course of a robbery and multiple murders, and found Cisneros guilty of 16 counts of robbery and one count of attempted robbery -- some involving armed heists at other businesses in the San Gabriel Valley area. Deputy District Attorney Frank Santoro told the eight-man, four-woman panel that Cisneros was a monster, a ruthless, brutal killer, who deserved a verdict of death because he ruined so many lives. Jurors agreed, and deliberating less than a day and a half before recommending that the 30-year-old defendant be put to death for his crimes. Hes due back in court June 18, when a formal sentencing date is scheduled to be set. A fourth co-defendant, Sara Lopez, 32, pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact in Wus death and was sentenced in 2010 to three years probation. —City News Service",0

"The IRS and local officials want residents to know if they receive a call from the IRS to be careful, it could be a phone scam. The scams, which have been circulating for more than a year, are continuing and residents should be aware this is happening, that despite what you see on your Caller ID they can be altered and it may not, in fact, be the IRS calling and threatening you. These unsolicited calls are coming from individuals demanding payment while fraudulently claiming to be from the IRS. More than a thousand people have been victims of this scam nationwide and have lost an estimated $5 million from these scams, according to the IRS. There are clear warning signs about these scams, which continue at high levels throughout the nation, said IRS Commissioner John Koskinen in a statement last year that has recirculated this week. Taxpayers should remember their first contact with the IRS will not be a call from out of the blue, but through official correspondence sent through the mail. A big red flag for these scams are angry, threatening calls from people who say they are from the IRS and urging immediate payment. This is not how we operate. People should hang up immediately and contact TIGTA or the IRS. Additionally, it is important for taxpayers to know that the IRS: Potential phone scam victims may be told that they owe money that must be paid immediately to the IRS or they are entitled to big refunds. When unsuccessful the first time, sometimes phone scammers call back trying a new strategy. Other characteristics of these scams include: What should you do If you get a phone call from someone claiming to be from the IRS? Taxpayers should be aware that there are other unrelated scams (such as a lottery sweepstakes) and solicitations (such as debt relief) that fraudulently claim to be from the IRS. The IRS encourages taxpayers to be vigilant against phone and email scams that use the IRS as a lure. The IRS does not initiate contact with taxpayers by email to request personal or financial information. This includes any type of electronic communication, such as text messages and social media channels. The IRS also does not ask for PINs, passwords or similar confidential access information for credit card, bank or other financial accounts. Recipients should not open any attachments or click on any links contained in the message. Instead, forward the email to phishing@irs.gov.

"The Avon Local School District and Avon Police are now interviewing for a School Resource Officer (SRO). The hiring will be a first of its kind for the Avon School District. The position will go into effect for the 2013-14 school year. Costs for the position will be split between the city and the school district although the citys finance director said he believed there could be grants to offset the costs. Were working out details, Superintendent of Schools Mike Laub said. Were looking to start with a part-time position and well see how it works. Laub said the individual would be a full-blown police officer. Avon Lake School District employs a school resource officer whose costs are similarly split. That officer maintains an office at Avon Lake High School. (He or she) will be hired as a police officer in Avon, Laub said. The person will have to have (an Ohio Peace Officer Training Academy Certificate). While details are still being worked out, Laub said that after going through Avon Police training, the SRO will have several school-based roles, including being in the class and advising students on making safe choices. Its definitely not a DARE officer, but theyll have a lot of the same roles, Laub said. There will be a focus on drug and alcohol prevention and awareness. Theyll also provide and extra layer of security. Laub said the district is essentially purchasing the service from the city. It will be a partnership (with the Avon police department), Laub said. The item was up for review at the March 18 Avon City Council meeting. We want to do this part time, Avon Mayor Jim Smith said. Councilman Dennis McBride said he wanted it made clear the SROs position had specific duties and was not at the school to act as a first responder.

The new officer will report to the Avon superintendent. All applicants must possess a current Ohio Peace Officer Training Academy Certificate. Applications were due March 15.",0
"Hopkins residents were surprised over the weekend when they awoke to find thieves parked in underground garages along Blake Road and Hiawatha Avenue. Thefts can happen to anyone, but residents can still take action to tilt the odds in their favor. Police Sgt. Michael Glassberg offered these tips to discourage so-called car prowlers from targeting your vehicle. # 1: Take your valuables out of your car. Glassberg said this the most important action that residents can take to prevent break-ins. Most vehicle thefts are crimes of opportunity, he said. Thieves see a pricy electronic gadget—or a cord that suggests one might be there—and decide to get into the car. If they dont see anything, theyll often move on to the next car. And dont try to throw thieves off by hiding your valuables: You never know if people are watching or maybe they watched you another day, Glassberg said. #2: Dont lock valuables in your trunk after youve reached your destination. Criminals are often on the lookout at both inside and outside parking areas for people stashing expensive items out of sight. #3: Stay on the lookout for suspicious activity. Being observant helps police prevent thefts. Dont be shy about reporting any activity that you think is off. #4: Think carefully about locking your car. Glassberg said he, personally, is always careful to lock his car. But he added that it can be worthwhile to leave a vehicle unlocked in order to prevent damage that occurs during break-ins. After all, thieves will sometimes break into a vehicle even if they dont see anything valuable. That being said, be certain that you dont leave anything of value in the vehicle. This doesnt just mean property that thieves might want. It also means documents with personal information that could be used for identity theft. #5: Park in heavily trafficked areas. Thieves are wary of areas where people are most likely to see them breaking into vehicles. Look for the areas with the most eyes, and avoid places that are hidden away from public view. Underground parking garages, where the most-recent thefts took place, are particularly bad because there hidden from both sight and sound. Even secure garages can shelter thieves, who may follow residents inside the garage. Underground garages are havens for car prowlers, Glassberg said.",0

"TOWSON, MD — When the Black Lives Matter sign was taken from Towson Unitarian Universalist Church over the weekend, it was not the first time such an act had happened. Nor was it the second or the third. The banner removed between Saturday night and Sunday morning marked the seventh time a Black Lives Matter banner has been taken since the church first installed it in October 2016, according to WBAL. In the first five weeks after its appearance along Dulaney Valley Road last fall, Fox 45 reported the banner was vandalized five times, which Rev. Clare Petersberger said showed it carried an important message. Police surveillance around the sign was conducted in January and February but did not yield a suspect, Baltimore County police told the Towson Times, adding that clandestine investigative methods are underway after a combination of yard signs and banners were removed or defaced in recent months. Why the vandalism and theft from a church that promotes an intentionally inclusive community? The church is hosting a community conversation about why it has chosen to display the message Black Lives Matter on its signage and to invite a dialogue about the issue. The event will be from 1:45 to 4 p.m. on Sunday, Nov. 12, at Towson Universalist Church, 1700 Dulaney Valley Road. Rev. Petersberger posted this Oct. 8 on the churchs website as the latest banner was put up, two weeks before it was said to have been stolen: Still from WBAL YouTube video.",0

"The suspect in the Minnesota mall stabbing may have been radicalized in the last few months, authorities announced at a Thursday morning news conference. FBI officials and local law enforcement provided a public update on the investigation into the stabbing that left 10 people wounded and the suspect dead at the Crossroads Center mall in St. Cloud. The suspect in the Sept. 17 attack, Dahir Ahmed Adan, 20, became interested in Islam in the last several months, stopped playing Xbox and told his female relatives to be more religious, FBI Special Agent Rick Thornton said at the news conference. We have numerous credible witness accounts of him asking victims during the attack if they were Muslim and at least one instance yelling Allahu akbar while stabbing one of his victims and others heard him yelling Islam Islam during the attack, Thornton added. We were told Adan had not previously shown an interest in religion. Adan also encouraged some female relatives to become more religiously observant. FBI Director James Comey said last week that it appears Adan was motivated by some sort of inspiration from radical Islamic groups. Comey said that investigators are not yet sure which groups may have inspired Adan at this point. On the day after the attack, the Islamic State-linked AMAQ news agency reported that the terrorist group described the suspect as a soldier of ISIS. Stearns County Attorney Janelle Kendall said Thursday that Adan was armed with two steak knives, one of which was bent during the course of the attacks. Kendall also said that off-duty police officer Jason Falconer, who shot and killed Adan following the stabbings, was justified in using lethal force and will not be charged with a crime. Officials showed several surveillance videos of the attack Thursday. One showed Adan stabbing an employee of a mall store, while another showed a bloody Adan crawling and trying to get up after being shot by Falconer.   Kendall said Adan approached Falconer and asked if he was Muslim. Falconer said he was a cop and told Adan to drop the knives he was holding. Adan then charged Falconer, at which point Falconer shot him. Still armed with one knife, Adan got up and crawled toward Falconer. Falconer shot him again. This sequence happened repeatedly until Adan could no longer get up. Kendall said Falconer fired 10 rounds, six of which hit Adan. Adan was wearing a private security uniform at the time of the attack. Kendall said that witnesses heard Falconer state that he is a police officer several times as he held up his police badge. Police were initially dispatched to a report of a stabbing inside the Crossroads Center mall just after 8 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 17. Authorities said Thursday that FBIs Joint Terrorism Task Force is continuing to investigate the attack. Image via YouTube",0

"REDWOOD CITY, CA -- A man accused of going on a random drive-by shooting spree starting with an apparent road rage incident last month in East Palo Alto pleaded not guilty to all charges Tuesday, San Mateo County prosecutors said. Oscar Alfredo Tapia-Carmona, a 30-year-old resident of East Palo Alto whos already on felony probation, was stopped at a red light at the intersection of West Bayshore and Capitol Expressway when he got angry with a stranger in an adjacent vehicle, then allegedly took out a handgun and fired a shot that went through the victims open window. Tapia-Carmona allegedly sped off, but was followed by the victim, who tried to take a picture of his license plate. After that the defendant stopped at the intersection of Newell and Woodland, then allegedly fired two shots at a 65-year-old woman carrying her groceries home. The victim was struck in the arm. The force of the gunshot knocked her down and the bullet shattered at least one of the bones. Tapia-Carmona once again allegedly fled the scene, driving into Palo Alto and allegedly striking a bicyclist, who wasnt injured - before going to work. He allegedly told his coworkers that he had been chased by several people on his way to work. The police were notified and Tapia-Carmona was arrested. Investigators said they found a Beretta handgun in his possession. District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe called it odd to see crimes like this with no apparent motive. The conduct itself, the lack of motivation for this dangerous conduct and the lack of explanation, makes one wonder if he has a mental illness, Wagstaffe said. Tapia-Carmona remains in custody on no-bail status, and is scheduled to return to court April 23 to set a date for his preliminary hearing. If convicted and sentenced, he could face life in prison, according to Wagstaffe. Defense attorney Savas Loukedis did not immediately respond to a request for comment on his clients behalf. --Bay City News/Photo via Shutterstock",0

"HOLLYWOOD, CA — Police Thursday said a Hollywood familys pit bull mix shot by an officer who responded to a nearby gang-related shooting continues to be aggressive to the treating veterinarian. The dog was wounded around 2:30 a.m. Saturday when officers responded to a shooting that occurred in an alley near the 5800 block of Willoughby Street and left three men injured, according to Los Angeles police Officer Norma Eisenman. Officers were clearing a residence when a large dog charged at them and an officer-involved shooting occurred, Eisenman said. The pit bull mix, named Kush, will require medical care topping $1,000, which his owners cannot afford, officials with the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Los Angeles said. According to an LAPD statement, the dog charged one of the officers conducting the search and the officer fired a single shot at the animal, which then ran into an adjoining room, only to return moments later and attempt to bite the officer. The dog stopped and ran to the bathroom where it was secured pending the arrival of (Animal Control), police said. The dog was taken to a city shelter to be treated by a veterinarian, who commented that treating (the) dog has been difficult as he is showing signs of aggression to caregivers, according to the LAPD. Brett Kerby and Norma Lopez, who live at the home and own the dog, told KTLA that officers had detained them in a patrol car then went into the house. They said their 7-year-old daughter was in the home along with her grandmother and a family friend. Officers who went into the home refused an offer by the family friend to remove the dog, and they shot Kush a short time later, the couple told the station. They said everyone was then taken out of the home, but the bleeding dog was left inside unattended until an animal-control officer arrived around 7 a.m. and took Kush to a shelter. Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Los Angeles officials contend the LAPD should pay for the dogs care, not force the family to cover the costs and seek reimbursement. I believe this demonstrates seizure of property and the agency (LAPD) should be responsible for treatment, spcaLA President Madeline Bernstein said. Forcing the owner to pay for vet care and submit a claim is unfair, Bernstein said. When an officer shoots a family dog, it is traumatic for everyone -- the officer, the dog, the family, and the community -- lets help them all heal by providing for Kushs care. The family has set up a GoFundMe page at www.gofundme.com/justice-for- kush, saying they will need at least $5,000 to cover the dogs medical care. Our Force Investigation Division detectives are still interviewing witnesses and collecting evidence as this investigation continues, according to the LAPD.

"LAWRENCEVILLE, GA — A Gwinnett County Police officer on Friday shot a man after the suspect fired shots at officers during a chase, authorities say. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is looking into the incident, which started in north Gwinnett and ended in Hall County. According to police spokeswoman Cpl. Michele Pihera, an officer recognized a man with active felony warrants for his arrest on Buford Highway near Hamlton Mill Road.

"LAKELAND, FL — A 75-year-old Lakeland mother is injured and her 53-year-old son dead following a Thursday night dispute that took a violent turn. According to the Polk County Sheriffs Office, deputies were called out to the Del Rose Drive North home of Marjorie Pacuicrk around 6:02 p.m. Nov. 10. Marjorie reportedly wanted assistance in getting her adult son, John Pacuicrk, to leave. Dispatchers asked Marjorie to wait outside the home for deputies, Sheriff Grady Judd said in a Thursday press conference.

"OCEANSIDE, CA – The Red Cross is helping four people displaced by a Christmas Day mudslide that hit an apartment complex, a city official said. No one was injured, according to Greg DeAvila, on-duty battalion chief for the Oceanside Fire Department. He added a crew remains on scene to determine the source of water that caused the slide and to help clean up.

When fire and police units arrived, they discovered a 75-feet-long, 12-feet-wide mudslide behind the building. Mud pushed through the lower units, damaging the structure and appliances, said Pete Lawrence, Oceanside battalion chief. Lawrence said the Red Cross is helping displaced residents with temporary housing. The apartment property management company will help in securing long-term accommodations for the residents, who will have to live elsewhere for an extended period of time, Lawrence said.

"A Ringwood man was pronounced dead after being submerged under the ice of Lake Iosco for more than 10 minutes Tuesday. Frank Ferrell, 52, died upon arriving at Chilton Hospital despite life-saving efforts of emergency responders. Ferrell was one of two men who fell through the ice about 150 yards from shoreline. He was unconscious when rescue volunteers pulled him out of the water, while Theodore Andreniuk, 49, of West Milford, was rescued minutes earlier from the water in a semi-conscious state. Ferrells death is currently under investigation by the Bloomingdale Police Department and Regional Medical Examiners Office. The men were ice fishing at the time, according to Bloomingdale Police Chief Joseph Borell, when a resident of a nearby home called 911 just after noon and said a person had fallen through the ice. A second 911 call came in three minutes after the first about Ferrell in the lake. Initially, police believed just one person had fallen through the ice. Police said the men had been ice fishing since about 9 a.m. You could hear someone screaming for help out on the lake, Borell said of the emergency responders first impression of the scene. One of the men was also seen waving his hands and yelling for help, Det. Steven Caputo said in a press release. Bloomingdale Volunteer Fire Department Chief Mike Hudson said Andreniuks hands could be seen from the water as the rescue volunteers pulled him from the ice. Volunteer firefighters Michael DAmato, Mike Wanklin Jr., Steve Shattls and Chris Neuberger put on ice rescue suits to assist. We were able to get him out very quickly, Hudson said. Andreniuk was transported by Tri-Boro First Aid Squad to a medevac helicopter that landed at the Walter T. Bergen School. He was flown to Hackensack University Medical Center. As of 5 p.m., he was listed in critical but stable condition. Borell said no one else was fishing on the lake at the time and Hudson said the men appeared to have walked out on to the ice as opposed to boating. It was not known whether they were invited to fish by the nearby resident. Were still investigating as to why they were out on the lake, Borell said. Borell said the lake was not entirely frozen. There were portions of the lake that were ice-covered and there were other portions of the lake that were water, he said. He also said he would not recommend anyone enter the ice of the lakes or ponds in the borough, particularly with warmer weather recently, as it is not safe. I certainly would not recommend being on any lakes, any ice, at this time, he said. Borell said in his 26 years on the force he does not recall a person falling through ice and needing rescue in Bloomingdale. One week ago, the Bloomingdale Council decided to table enacting prohibition of ice activities, such as ice fishing, on public borough ponds. The prohibition is intended to ensure safety as the ponds, Oakwood Lake and Bogue Pond, are not monitored. Consideration of the prohibition ordinance was inspired by the deaths of two Mount Olive teenagers who fell through the ice of Budd Lake. The prohibition being considered, however, would only apply to public bodies of water and not private lakes in the borough, such as Lake Iosco. The Bloomingdale police and fire departments, New Jersey State Police, the Passaic County Sheriffs Rescue Squad and the Pompton Lakes Fire Department were among the agencies responding to the scene.

"TRENTON, NJ -- Seven people -- including a Red Bank couple -- have been charged with fraud related to Superstorm Sandy assistance, the state attorney generals office said Wednesday. James Avellini, 67, and Susan Horty-Avellini, 65, of Red Bank, are accused of getting $49,969 by filing false applications following Superstorm Sandy for FEMA assistance and state grants under the Homeowner Resettlement Program (RSP) and the Sandy Homeowner and Renter Assistance Program funded by the state Department of Human Services, according to a news release from the office of Acting Attorney General Robert Lougy. The charges released Wednesday bring the total to 57 people who have been charged with fraud as a result of investigations into applications for federal relief funds related to Sandy, Lougys office said. It is alleged the Avellinis falsely claimed in the applications that a storm-damaged property that they owned on Norman Court in Lavallette was their primary residence at the time Sandy hit. It is alleged that, in reality, the couples primary residence was in Red Bank, and the property in Lavallette was a seasonal home. The couple received a $24,992 FEMA grant, a $10,000 RSP grant, and $14,977 in SHRAP funding. Both defendants are charged with third-degree theft by deception and fourth-degree unsworn falsification.  Under each of these disaster relief programs, it was made absolutely clear that only those whose primary residences were damaged qualified for aid, but these defendants selfishly lied about their situation to divert funding intended for those left homeless when Sandy struck, Lougy said. Its a sad truth that even in the direst of emergencies, when so many generous people step forward to lend a hand, there are others who will dishonestly exploit an offer of assistance.  Others charged Wednesday by complaint-summons:      Through these joint investigations with our state and federal law enforcement partners, were working to ensure that limited disaster relief funds are allocated to the qualified victims who were hardest hit, Director Elie Honig of the Division of Criminal Justice said. Were also sending a deterrent message that we hope will reduce this criminal conduct in future emergencies, so relief administrators can focus on recovery efforts instead of policing fraud.  Sandy recovery remains central to DCAs mission, and a key part of that mission is helping our law enforcement partners root out people who are trying to game the system at the expense of storm victims who legitimately qualify for help, DCA Commissioner Charles A. Richman said. Because defrauders and scammers impede the States recovery efforts and pilfer taxpayer dollars, my Department doesnt hesitate to report suspicious applications when we see them.  Second-degree charges carry a sentence of five to 10 years in state prison and a fine of up to $150,000. Third-degree charges carry a sentence of three to five years in state prison and a fine of up to $15,000, while fourth-degree charges carry a sentence of up to 18 months in state prison and a fine of $10,000. The charges are merely accusations and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty.",0

"SAN MATEO COUNTY, CA — A man who picked up his girlfriend from her last shift at San Francisco International Airport last week and planned to move with her to Las Vegas was fatally shot by a fellow SFO worker who sought a romantic relationship with her, San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said this week. Kevin Prasad, 31, of South San Francisco, and Donovan Rivera, 25, of Hayward, are charged in the murder of 31-year-old Mark Mangaccat last Wednesday. That day, Mangaccat drove to pick up his girlfriend, the mother of their 3-year-old child. Prasad, who worked at SFO with her, had been trying to develop a romantic relationship with her and urged her to dump Mangaccat but she had rebuffed his advances, prosecutors said. Rivera allegedly drove Prasad as they followed Mangaccat, who picked up his girlfriend and returned to their home on Abbot Avenue in Daly City. As Mangaccat was backing the vehicle into the garage, Prasad allegedly walked up and fired five to six shots into the car, killing him while not hitting the girlfriend, prosecutors said. The working proposition for the motive is, If I kill him and get him out of the way, then I could be there to start the relationship with the grieving widow, Wagstaffe said. Thats pretty bizarre. Wagstaffe said the couple was planning on moving to Las Vegas after living with Mangaccats family in Daly City and said last Wednesday had been the girlfriends last shift. Following the shooting, Prasad allegedly ran back to the car and Rivera drove them away from the scene, but investigators were able to identify and arrest them a day later, according to Wagstaffe. The two defendants made their initial court appearance Monday on murder charges with a special circumstance of lying in wait. They did not enter pleas and will return to court on May 8 for appearance of their appointed Private Defender Program attorneys and to possibly enter pleas. Daly City police have not released any information about the case and referred any inquiries about it to the district attorneys office. Social media posts about Mangaccat mourned his death. He was one of the nicest people, one post read. I still cant believe it.Meanwhile, three weeks ago Prasad apparently testified at a San Francisco Board of Supervisors hearing on raising minimum wages for workers, saying he was a security officer at SFO who is also a veteran and part of the working poor. The clip of Prasad speaking at the hearing was posted on the Facebook page for Airport Workers United, a union of airport workers.

"HOWELL NJ -- (Updated, noon Tuesday) A pair of brothers have been charged with shooting at a man who was yelling at a woman the parking lot of Countryside Apartments Monday evening, Howell Police Chief Andrew Kudrick said Tuesday. Lloyd Gomes, 29, and Ramano Gomes, 28, who live together on North American Drive, Howell, are both charged with possession of a weapon for unlawful purposes and are being held at the Monmouth County Correctional Institute, Freehold Township, in lieu of $75,000 bail, no 10 percent option, each, Kudrick said.

Police officers who responded soon determined the truck was a box truck, not a tractor trailer, and that the box truck had hit cars in the parking lot, he said. The investigation determined there had been an dispute where a man was outside yelling at a woman who lived in one of the apartments, Kudrick said. The disruption from the mans screaming led two neighbors, now identified as the Gomes brothers, to confront the man, he said. The Gomeses did not know the man and they are not related, Kudrick said. The confrontation led to the man getting into a large box truck and in his attempt to get away, hit cars in the parking lot. One of the cars hit was registered to Lloyd Gomes, Antunez said. The Gomeses then fired several shots from handguns at man through the truck. The man was not hit and fled the scene, Kudrick said. There were no reported injuries, he said.

"Despite area interest in increasing public safety, housing the Cook County Sheriffs Central Warrants Unit at the former 13th District Police Station will not affect area police patrolling. Ald. Proco Joe Moreno (1st) announced Wednesday the County Board of Commissioners passed the proposal for the station at 927 N. Wood St. The space has remained vacant since December when it was consolidated with the 12th Districts station. But while Moreno said hes kept his promise to keep a police presence at the station, some neighbors note the Central Warrants Unit is not similar to actual law enforcement, but instead deals with the apprehension of county fugitives. When the announcement that the 13th district police station would be closed and consolidated with the 12th District Station, I vowed to fight for a police presence on the site, Moreno said in a statement. Today, I am extremely happy and proud to have kept this promise. When the announcement was made regarding the stations closure, a five-person team was created to help decide what should be done with the old building. Ideas like a dog park or community amphitheater were included in a survey sent to residents, but based on comments, neighbors wished they could keep police at the station. With topline from early October, three things popped, but importantly, nearly 50 percent of the respondents added comments requesting some form of POLICE presence, comments Ronda Locke, a member of the five-person panel. The three things that popped were in order 1) land swap in order to expand Commercial Park, 2) adult park at Wood St, or 3) dog park, with comments to the affect if a police presence was not an option. Although the Central Warrants Unit is not the same as Chicago police officers, Moreno said the five-person team was overwhelmingly pleased with this news. For the next 10 years, at least 100 sheriffs will be located at the station, writes Our Urban Times. The plan, which has yet to be approved by the City Council, said the county will pay $1 annually to least the space through 2023. Moreno says $500,000 in city money, as well as $100,000 in Ward 1 menu money, will help fund the new facility, DNAinfo Chicago reports. Follow Us on Facebook!",0
"Trevor Watson, one of two men convicted in the 2000 attack on Celtics star Paul Pierce, was found guilty of attempted murder of a Drug Enforcement Administration informant by a federal jury on Thursday, the US Attorneys office announced. Watson, a 44-year-old Dorchester resident, faces up to 30 years in prison for the crime, which was committed outside Anns Unisex Barbershop on Tremont Street in the South End. His sentencing is scheduled for March 10, 2011. Its the second time in the last month that Watson has been brought to a federal jury on charges of tampering with a witness. A mistrial was declared in the case on Nov. 9 because of a hung jury. The second trial began Monday. Evidence introduced at the most recent trial showed that Watson stabbed the informant approximately 10 times, causing serious injuries to the victims colon and intestines, US Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz said in a statement. While stabbing the informant, Watson said, you talking, huh? you telling. According to testimony at trial, the informant had provided information against Watson in a federal cocaine trafficking investigation, Ortiz said. Prosecutors also proved that Watson manipulated witnesses prepared to testify against him in the Paul Pierce trial by exposing letters and phone calls made from prison to his associates. In those letters, Watson wrote, I had introduced my lawyer to the fact that if the victim in my case was to sign an affidavit saying Im not the guy who stabbed him, it was some Spanish guy about 30, which I am not either, Ill be alright... and The Paul Pierce case was the same way, but at trial he changed his statements and I got found not guilty of att. mur. (attempted murder). Prior to the the Pierce trial, one witness told investigators she saw a man named Trevor stab Pierce, but recanted that statement before trial, according to prosecutors. Watson served a one-year sentence after being convicted of assault and battery.",0

"New Trier High Schools Mobile Learning Initiative will have all students use their own iPad for school by the 2014-15 school year. While some believe this plan will eventually save money for the district in the long run, other parents think that the program is unfair for non-wealthy families, an article by Business Insider states. Were in a wealthy district, but you cant assume that everyones wealthy, Mary Rita Kropp, a New Trier parent, was quoted in the article. The program pays an average of $620 for the iPad, keyboard, case and applications. Families receive a $270 subsidy, who can then pay $350 for a 16GB version or $450 for a 32GB iPad. Alternatively, families can pay $180 a year for three years in a lease-to-own option or just buy a 2n generation or later option on their own. Families will be able to seek financial assistance from the school if needed. Do you believe the iPads are too much of a financial burden for families? Let us know in the comments!

Pasadena police detectives, a detective from the Glendale Police Department and state parole agents arrested Anthony Fierro of Huntington Park on Wednesday.

"A rash of deadly deer encounters on East Lake Road has local activists calling for change. Despite the recent addition of Deer Crossing signs in the area, deer and vehicles are still colliding at a pace that has some residents worried about safety. Evidence of the deadly encounters is often visible on the busy road. Theres a lot of blood on the road. You drive on the road and you see all the blood and it doesnt speak well for our community, said Barb Walker, an East Lake resident and mother of two children. Walker is also a volunteer with the Audubon Society and blogs on Patch. In addition to helping rescue injured birds in the area, she keeps an informal count of deer that are killed on the road. According to her tally, six deer were hit and killed in the East Lake area the past week. Its a situation thats difficult for everyone, from the Pinellas County Sheriffs Deputies who call trappers to shoot and kill the suffering deer -or in some instances shoot the animals themselves- to the drivers who hit the deer. Walker says her husband was once two hours late to work because he stopped to help someone who hit a deer. He wound up staying to console the person, who was very upset. People who hit deer, theyre victims too. Its traumatic, she said. Why the Recent Increase? Deer are often hit this time of year, because theyre more active during their breeding season which is from October through January. Pinellas County Sheriffs Deputies responded to two accidents on East Lake Rd. last week involving deer. Two deer were hit Dec. 14 by a car near Sandy Point Rd., which is just north of John Chesnut Sr. Park, where many deer feed. Both injured deer were shot and killed by a trapper. Another deer was hit Dec. 16 near Boot Ranch Rd. That deer was also euthanized by a trapper. The Florida Highway Patrol responded to two recent accidents involving deer on East Lake Rd. One crash was around 1 a.m. on Oct. 31 near Boot Ranch Rd. A deer ran across the road and into the path of a Hyundai Elantra, causing an estimated $4,000 damage. The most recent crash was around 6:30 a.m. Dec. 11 near the intersection of Tarpon Woods Blvd. A deer ran into the path of a Ford Mustang, causing an estimated $2,000 damage to the car. In both crashes the deer were killed. Main Cause Florida Fish and Wildlife Spokesperson Gary Morse says the deadly encounters are a result of habitat fragmentation, a term used to describe situations when wildlifes habitat is divided by something like a road, a river or homes. He says the situation threatens wildlife who must still try to reproduce and find food, despite obstacles like East Lake Rd. Morse says Florida Fish and Wildlife Officers have had to shoot injured deer whove been hit by cars to end the deers suffering. He says deer are very hard to rehabilitate after theyve been injured. They often die from stress. Vernon Yates, who operates Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation in Seminole agrees. He rehabilitates deer that are not too badly injured. Yates says deputies often call him after a deer has been hit. We take in a lot of deer, he said. If rehabilitating a deer is not possible and the deer are euthanized, Yates uses them as meat for the tigers and other big cats that he has at his rescue facility. Possible Solutions Finding a solution to the dangerous deer encounters is difficult, according to Morse. Fencing would just aggravate habitat fragmentation. Dropping birth control pellets to try to control the deer population interferes with natural order. He says hunting in certain areas has helped keep the deer population down, but this might not be realistic in a suburban area thats home to more than 30,000 people. Barb Walker thinks in order to solve the problem, leaders must get advice from multiple experts who have experience dealing with this type of situation. I dont think theres any single solution, she said. We need to use our brains before our brawn, she added, referring to the deer shootings. We need a better procedure in place and we need some public education. Council of North County Neighborhoods (CNCN) President Don Ewing says East Lakes deer problems are on his organizations radar. Its going to be one of the top priorities for 2013, he said. Whats next? The issue will be discussed at CNCNs meeting on January 21. The meeting location has not been determined. As soon as it is announced, we will pass that information along. Related- Blogs by Barb Walker-",0
"From the Plymouth County District Attorneys office. A jury has convicted a Rhode Island man for the 2010 murder of a brother and sister in Brockton, Plymouth County District Attorney Timothy J. Cruz has announced. After a 7-day trial, a jury deliberated eight hours before finding John V. Monteiro, 31, guilty of First Degree Murder in the deaths of Maria DePina, 26, and Jorge DePina, 30, of Brockton. Monteiro was additionally convicted on one count each of Unlawful Possession of a Firearm, Armed Home Invasion, and the Sale or Transfer of a Firearm. Brockton Superior Court Judge Richard Chin sentenced Monteiro to life without the possibility of parole. On January 21, 2010, at approximately 9:16 a.m., Brockton and State Police responded to the scene of a double homicide at 52 Nilsson Street in Brockton. Upon arrival, inside the second floor apartment, police located the deceased body of a male, identified as Jorge DePina in a bed in the rear bedroom. His sister, Maria DePina was found on the kitchen floor. Both suffered gunshot wounds to the head. An autopsy revealed that the cause of death for Maria DePina was a gunshot wound to the head with perforation of the skull and brain. The cause of death for Jorge DePina was gunshot wounds to the head/neck/torso with perforation of the skull and brain. State Police Detectives assigned to the Plymouth County District Attorneys Office and the Brockton Police conducted an investigation, which found that Monteiro forced his way into the 52 Nilsson Street apartments and shot the victims in the head. The investigation further found that Monteiro later sold the gun used in the murders to an informant working with the FBI. The firearm was turned over to the State Police for ballistics and DNA testing. The testing results showed that the firearm sold by Monteiro was the gun used in the murders of Jorge and Maria DePina. On that morning, Mr. Monteiro entered the DePina home and stood over Jorges sleeping body and fired three shots, DA Cruz said. Maria was getting ready for work, heard the commotion and met up with Mr. Monteiro in the hallway. Mr. Monteiro shot Maria in the back of the head as she tried to get away. This was a brutal crime that decimated a family and stunned the Brockton community.  Throughout the trial, State Police and Brockton Police were forced to maintain a presence in the Brockton Superior Courthouse due to tension amongst supporters of the victims and the defendant. This was a particularly tough case, and I want to commend those with the courage to come forward on this case, DA Cruz said. With their help, an extremely dangerous man is now off of the streets and we have hopefully gained some justice for the DePina family. After the verdicts were read in court today, Monteiro asked for a bench trial on the two charges of Unlawful Possession of a Firearm, Subsequent Offense and Sale or Transfer of a Firearm, Subsequent Offense. Judge Chin found Monteiro guilty and sentenced him to serve 5-7 years in State Prison on the charges.",0

"UPDATE 8:15 PM- Three train cars carrying sulfuric acid have been placed back on the tracks under Interstate Highway 680 in Martinez and moved away from the area where they derailed this morning, according to firefighters. As of 5:30 p.m. Wednesday evening, crews had managed to upright two of the three cars, and were working to get the third car back on the tracks. It was the most severely damaged of the three, according to Contra Costa County Fire Protection District Fire Marshal Robert Marshall. Firefighters announced via Twitter that all the cars had been put back on the tracks and the scene had been turned back over to the railroad company at 7:48 p.m. The tanker cars, which did not leak their contents, initially derailed under the highway near Marina Vista Avenue at about 7:30 a.m., Union Pacific Railroad spokesman Francisco Castillo Jr. said. Castillo said a Union Pacific crew delivered another companys 20 train cars on Monday from its tracks to an industry line used by a company called Eco Services. According to county officials, the company removes certain substances from the acid. When the train was being moved, three of its tanker cars came off the tracks, Castillo said. One of the cars tipped over at a roughly 45-degree angle. County hazmat crews that initially responded determined the tankers were not leaking their sulfuric acid contents. Local activist Andrés Soto, a spokesman for Benicians for a Safe and Healthy Community, was at the scene this afternoon. He called the incident a near miss. The whole community dodged a bullet, he said, given that the sulfuric acid didnt leak out. Soto, whose group is against a proposal to deliver crude oil by rail to a Valero refinery in Benicia, said this represents a warning sign. Once again we learn transporting hazardous materials by railroads is a dangerous business, he said. ------------------------ UPDATE 5:15 PM- Crews are in the process of placing three train cars carrying sulfuric acid back on tracks under Interstate Highway 680 in Martinez after they derailed this morning, according to a rail company official. The tanker cars, which reportedly did not leak their contents, initially derailed under the highway near Marina Vista Avenue at about 7:30 a.m., Union Pacific Railroad spokesman Francisco Castillo Jr. said. Castillo said a Union Pacific crew delivered another companys 20 train cars on Monday from its tracks to an industry line used by a company called Eco Services. According to its website, the company provides sulfuric acid regeneration services. When the train was in the process of being moved, three of its tanker cars came off the tracks, Castillo said. One of the cars tipped over at an about 45-degree angle. Castillo said a contracted crew using heavy equipment is working to upright that car and place the cars back on the tracks. County hazmat crews that initially responded determined the tankers were not leaking their sulfuric acid contents and are overseeing the work. And with any operation of that sort, there are safety concerns, said Matt Kaufmann, assistant director of the Contra Costa County Hazardous Materials department.

And with any operation of that sort, there are safety concerns, Kaufmann said. Were there to make sure its done in the safest way possible. Sulfuric acid is a corrosive liquid thats primarily a contact hazard, Kaufmann explained, meaning its a health risk when it touches skin. In large concentrations, it can also become an inhalation hazard. Kaufmann said its not likely that this mornings situation would result in that type of hazard, although crews are monitoring the air at the scene. ----------------- (original story) MARTINEZ - Three train cars derailed under Interstate Highway 680 in Martinez this morning and hazardous materials crews are responding to the scene, authorities said.

"Two people, including a teenager, have been arrested and charged with the murder of a Roswell man who was selling his gaming console on Craigslist. Nathaniel Vivan, 20, and a 16-year-old girl are both in custody following the Friday, Sept. 12 shooting death of Daniel John Zeitz, 28, of Roswell, the Sandy Springs Police Department said in a press release. Zeitz was found dead by officers after they responded to a call around 9:30 p.m. in the 5300 block of Treelodge Parkway. The Roswell man was found lying on the ground in front of building 5306 with a gunshot wound to the side of his chest, police spokesperson Sgt. Ron Momon said. A short time later, Sandy Springs detectives learned that a man was being treated at Northside Hospital with a gunshot wound to the hand, Momon stated. Brookhaven Police detectives were at the hospital interviewing the injured man, who Momon said told them he was a victim of a crime in their jurisdiction. However, Momon noted the man later told authorities he was shot while he and his girlfriend were at the Legends of Dunwoody Apartments to rob a man of his PS4 video game system that was advertised on Craigslist. The female juvenile, who was at the hospital with Vivan, was taken into custody by Sandy Springs police detectives. Those detectives also found the .25 caliber pistol inside the suspects car, which was parked at the hospital. Detectives interviewed the man and teen, and learned they responded to a Craigslist ad for the console and met with Zeitz in the parking lot of 5306 Treelodge Parkway. Vivan, who was seating in the drivers seat of his car, struggled with Zeitz, [who was] standing outside the car, for the PS4, Momon stated. During the struggle, the juvenile fired one shot from the .25 caliber gun. The bullet passed through Vivans hand and struck Zeitz in the side. Detectives also learned that the teenagers child, about 16 months old, was also in the back seat of the suspects car during the robbery and shooting. The child was later turned over to the teens relatives. Both suspects remain behind bars pending their first court appearance. (Photo: Daniel John Zeitz of Roswell. Credit: Facebook)",0

"GREENDALE -- In 2014, the Milwaukee Common Council voted to approve a new sex offender ordinance, banning them from living within 2,000 feet of schools, parks and day care centers. According to a report by the Journal Sentinel this week, supporters of the ordinance back in 2014 said it would protect the public by pushing more offenders out of the city and into the suburbs, where a disproportionately low number of the countys offenders lived. We wanted to know what this meant for Greendale. Using information compiled by the State Department of Corrections, we were able to create a registered sex offender map for Greendale, showing locations of each offender. In total, Greendale houses 5 such offenders.

As it turns out, tighter rules in Milwaukee havent produced the mass-exodus into the suburbs as initially thought. Instead, it has given rise to a spike in the homeless sex offender problem - and thats worrisome for public officials.

"A 31-year-old Costa Mesa woman was sentenced today to nearly six years in federal prison for operating a foreclosure rescue fraud scheme that targeted homeowners with bogus promises of mortgage relief. Najia Jalan was ordered to pay restitution of about $236,000 and serve three years of supervised release following her 70-month prison term, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office. She pleaded guilty in July in Los Angeles to mail fraud and aggravated identity theft charges. Jalan -- who is not a licensed attorney -- used company names such as the National Legal Help Center, United National Mortgage Protection Center, OC NonProfit, American Consumer Law Center to trick victims into paying her substantial fees for fake services, prosecutors said. Jalan also created various aliases to attract struggling homeowners by deceptively promising foreclosure relief or mortgage modifications to make consumers payments substantially more affordable, court papers show. Promising to obtain results within a certain period of time, she charged homeowners unlawful advance fees, ranging from $1,000 to $3,000 and in some cases more than $10,000, prosecutors said. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sued Jalan and a co-defendant in 2012 in connection with the National Legal Help Center, which falsely claimed that they would provide legal representation for consumers even though the defendants were not attorneys and consumers received no actual legal representation, according to the agency. -City News Service",0

"In the wake of an attack on a Chesterfield student on the campus of St. Louis Community College-Meramec and its subsequent mishandling by the university, St. Louis County Police Chief Tim Fitch is urging schools to be more aggressive in their treatment of suspects in criminal incidents. Writing in his blog, Fitch said that part of the problem is that educational institutions often would rather handle crimes as school violations instead of notifying police. This goes on more than you realize, Fitch wrote. Schools, like most instiutions that rely on public support for funding, do not want to look bad or admit they have problems for fear that their next bond issue or tax increase might not pass. Fitch then specifically referenced his home district of Rockwood as an example of how bad publicity can doom a bond issue. The districts $38.4 million Prop S failed to pass this spring following controversy created by a state audit and the subsequent resignation of a school board member. In the case of the Meramec attack, the college came under fire for not immediately alerting students about the assault and was also criticized for briefly releasing the suspect, Jevon Mallory, 18, who was eventually charged in connection to the incident. The controversy culminated on Monday, when SLCC-Meramec President George Wasson announced his resignation from the post. The president of SLCC-Wildwood will take over in an interim capacity. Fitch, who said his daughter attends SLCC-Meramec, wrote that it was likely that the attack would have gone unreported if the victims family hadnt gone to the media. As Patch previously reported, 19-year-old Blythe Grupe of Chesterfield, said she was attacked in a womens restroom on campus April 18. An instructor heard Grupes screams, ran into the bathroom, which stopped the alleged assault, and then called campus police. Fitch said the issue of schools downplaying criminal incidents in hopes of avoiding negative publicity is longstanding. He gave several examples from his career in law enforcement: There was a time a few years ago when we had to threaten a local school superintendent and principal with prosecution under the Missouri Safe Schools Act for failing to report acts of violence in their school to police authorities.  They didnt take us seriously until we brought a prosecutor to the school to let them know we (and the Prosecuting Attorneys Office) meant business.  Things have gotten much better in that district since then.  I saw the same resistance from some districts when we started our heroin initiative in 2010 and asked to hold Town Hall meetings in school auditoriums.  One local district chastised me for even suggesting that schools were in denial about their drug problems. He ended the blog post by noting that serious crimes such as the Meramec assault are infrequent and suggested that in the future, SLCC promptly turn over any felony crime to the Kirkwood Police, an agency that would not be beholden to image-conscious bosses at the campus.",0

"By Caitlin Brown A state probation officer working in Middlesex County was taken into custody today on charges of accepting bribes from a client who was serving a probationary term for drug offenses, according to Middlesex County Prosecutor Andrew C. Carey. Rhonda Battle, 46, of Roselle, was charged with official misconduct and bribery, both third degree offenses, for taking an undisclosed amount of cash on various occasions between January 1, 2014 and December 23, 2014. Battle is being held on $20,000 bail set in New Brunswick by Superior Court Judge Bradley Ferencz, who said the defendant may be released after posting 10 percent of the amount. Battle was charged during an investigation by Detective Nicholas Chiorello of the Middlesex County Prosecutors Office. The investigation determined that Battle accepted cash amounts to ensure the client passed drug testing and would not be found in violation of the conditions of a court-ordered probationary term. Battle had been employed as a probation officer and was assigned to work with clients who had been admitted to the state Superior Courts Drug Court program at the Middlesex County Courthouse in New Brunswick. As an alternative to incarceration, the program offers counseling, rehabilitation and probationary terms to first-time offenders. Prosecutor Carey said the criminal justice system cannot properly function without the publics confidence. It is incumbent upon the Middlesex County Prosecutors Office to help maintain the integrity of the Drug Court, which offers a viable means of addressing the problems of addiction, Prosecutor Carey said. The program will only continue to be successful if those who help administer it remain above reproach. The investigation is active and is continuing. Anyone with information is asked to call Detective Chiorello of the Middlesex County Prosecutors Office at (732) 745-3848. As is the case with all criminal defendants, the charges against Battle are merely accusations and she is presumed innocent until proven guilty.

"LOS ANGELES, CA — Los Angeles County prosecutors have asked the sheriffs department to conduct additional investigation before a decision is made on whether to file a criminal case against a 17-year-old student accused of making a shooting threat at El Camino High School in South Whittier, it was revealed Thursday. Authorities said the threat involving El Camino High was made Friday, two days after a former student at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, went on a campus shooting rampage that left 17 people dead. The El Camino student -- whose name was not released because of his age -- was reportedly upset with one of his teachers over a set of earphones and allegedly threatened to shoot up the campus, leading to a search of his home and the discovery of a cache of weapons, authorities said. On Wednesday, Los Angeles County Sheriff Jim McDonnell said investigators responded to a report by Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District resource officer Marino Chavez, who overheard the student threatening that he was going to shoot up the school sometime in the next three weeks. Chavez, whos been on the job for nearly three decades, told reporters that he took the teen to the schools office, where the boy confirmed the remark, prompting Chavez to contact the sheriffs department. He did say that he was just kidding, that he did not mean it, Chavez said. I said, Well, you cant say those things on a school campus. He was angry with the teachers issue about his (earphones) in class and he was not allowed to go to her class the next day, so he was supposed to go to the office, Chavez said. No weapons were found on the student at the time, officials said. McDonnell said deputies learned that the boy had an extensive discipline history at the school, and that a Smith & Wesson semi-automatic weapon was registered to his home address. Deputies served a warrant at the students home in Norwalk, and found two AR-15 rifles, two handguns and 90 high-capacity ammunition magazines, McDonnell said. The teens 28-year-old brother, Army veteran Daniel Eriberto Barcenas, was arrested for allegedly having an unregistered AR-15 rifle in the familys home. He was scheduled to be arraigned Thursday afternoon at the Bellflower courthouse on a misdemeanor count of possession of an assault weapon. The boy remains held in a juvenile detention facility, according to the sheriffs department. This is not unusual for prosecutors to ask for additional information before pursuing next steps in the legal process, according to a sheriffs department statement. We will continue to work with the DA to facilitate further investigation and let the facts take us wherever they lead. City News Service; Shutterstock",0

"Westchester County District Attorney Janet DiFiore announced that Scott Yandrasevich (DOB 2/25/1964) of 11 Abbey Lane, Danbury, Connecticut, was arraigned today on an eleven indictment charging him with:   Between April 10th, 2007 and August 20, 2012, the defendant, who was the General Manager of the Rye Golf Club, located at 330 Boston Post Road, in Rye, New York, stole approximately $342,120 from the Club and the City of Rye by knowingly submitting false invoices to the City of Rye for fictitious employees over this approximate four and a half year period.  The club is a Rye City owned non-equity membership club.  The defendant accomplished this larceny by setting up and effectively controlling a staffing company called RM Staffing for the purposes of billing the City of Rye for services provided to the Club.  The defendant submitted false bi-weekly invoices on RM Staffing stationary listing individual(s) who were falsely described as working in Administration, Restaurant and/or Operations at the Club, when in fact no such person(s) worked for the Club.  In total, these fraudulent invoices were submitted during a span of over one hundred pay periods and the City of Rye paid out approximately $342,120 to RM Staffing for these fictional services.  After RM Staffing received these stolen monies, said stolen monies were ultimately transferred back to the defendant, who used said funds for his own personal use.  The City became aware of financial irregularities, hired outside counsel who further investigated and forwarded those findings to the District Attorneys office. Bail was continued at $10,000 cash or bond.  The defendants next court date is May 21st, 2014.  He faces a maximum sentence of fifteen years in state prison.  Assistant District Attorney Brian Conway, Deputy Chief of the Public Integrity Bureau is prosecuting the case.",0

"Another telephone scam is preying on the public. The U.S. Marshals Service issued a release that said individuals claiming to be U.S. marshals, court officers or law enforcement officials that are trying to collect a fine for failing to report to jury duty. The victims are threatened with arrest if they dont pay. In order to appear more credible, the scammers may even provide information such as a badge number and the name of an actual federal judge and courthouse address. Victims are told they can avoid arrest by paying a fine using a reloadable credit card and are urge to call a number to provide their own credit card information to initiate the process. The U.S. Marshals Service does not call anyone to arrange payment of fines over the phone for failure to appear for jury duty or any other infraction.

"WATERBURY, CT — Cars stolen from other towns across Fairfield County and beyond have wound up in Waterbury, and Mayor Neil OLeary told WTNH it is an enourmous problem. Deputy Police Chief Fernando Spagnolo said the cars were not stripped for parts, but were often taken on joyrides or to commit other crimes. Cars from Greenwich, Fairfield, Westport, New Canaan, Ridgefield and Middletown have turned up in Waterbury. An Audi S5 stone from Ridgefield was recovered last Monday afternoon after it was reported stolen the night before. In most cases, the victims left their vehicles unlocked with the keys inside, making their vehicle a prime target for theft. Ridgefield Police Capt. Jeff Kreitz told the Ridgefield Press that a gang from Waterbury is suspected to be responsible for the thefts. Ridgefield police investigated 11 reports of stolen vehicles, compared to three reported between 2014 and 2016. Spagnolo told WTNH that young people in gangs are stealing the cars. A 15-year-old girl from Waterbury was shot in the back in Ridgefield after her and a group of teenagers tried to steal a car from a home on Hulda Lane. The girl and another teen were arrested after the girl showed up at Waterbury Hospital with a gunshot wound to her back. Greenwich police Lt. John Slusarz also credited a Waterbury gang among others for swiping luxury cars in Greenwich after eight vehicles were stolen in the town in November alone. Around 35 cars were reported stolen in Fairfield from April 1 to July 27, according to the Connecticut Post. Four cars were stolen in one weekend in November in New Canaan, prompting New Canaan Police Chief Leon Krolikowski to alert his town about the Waterbury gangs alleged involvement. These crimes are being committed by suspected gang members from Waterbury, wrote Krolikowski in a statement, and offered tips to avoid being a victim. Many towns in Fairfield County are experiencing similar crimes from the same gang. Read more from WTNH here. Image via Shutterstock",0

"A Peabody man known under several different names pleaded guilt to heroin and fentanyl trafficking charges in U.S. District Court on Wednesday. Jorge Delgado, a/k/a Antonio Martinez, a/k/a Elisaul Martinez Santana, 28, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute heroin and fentanyl and three counts of distribution of heroin. U.S. District Court Judge F. Dennis Saylor IV scheduled sentencing for Jan. 13, 2016. Delgado was the leader of a drug ring responsible for distributing heroin and fentanyl in the Salem and Peabody area, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office. They say Delgado received orders for heroin from customers via cellphone and often sent couriers, two of whom were charged as co-defendants, to distribute drugs for him. Delgados drug ring not only distributed heroin but also distributed fentanyl in place of heroin on numerous occasions. Delgados co-defendants, Juanel Pena and Thomas Martinez-Ortiz, previously pleaded guilty. This case was brought as part of the federal response to the growing opioid abuse epidemic in Massachusetts and other New England states. A recent surge in overdose deaths has been attributed in part to the addition of Fentanyl to heroin, creating a toxic mixture substantially more potent, and more dangerous, than heroin alone, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office. The charging statute provides a sentence of no greater than 20 years in prison, a minimum of three years and up to a lifetime of supervised release and a fine of $1 million. Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. United States Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz; Michael J. Ferguson, Special Agent in Charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Boston Field Division; Chief Mary Butler of the Salem Police Department; and Chief Thomas M. Griffin of the Peabody Police Department, made the announcement today. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Young Paik.",0

"ARCADIA, CA — Los Angeles County Firefighters, along with relatives, colleagues and friends gathered Friday to honor the life of a Los Angeles firefighter who died two days after falling from a ladder during a training exercise. Kelly Wong, 29, fell about six stories from the Los Angeles Fire Department aerial ladder while participating in an exercise in downtown Los Angeles on June 3. He died at a hospital. A procession began about 8 a.m. at Main and First streets, led by an LAFD fire truck bearing the casket, followed by an honor guard and hundreds of mourners who walked north on Main Street and then heading west on Temple Street to the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels for a celebration of life service, which began about 9 a.m. and ended shortly before 11 a.m. He was a big guy with a big heart, LAFD Capt. Erik Scott said. LAFD Chief Ralph Terrazas and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti were among the mourners. More than 1,000 uniformed personnel from law enforcement and firefighting organizations from numerous jurisdictions were on hand for the memorial. We are here today in this city of angels to celebrate the life of an angel, Garcetti told the mourners. Celebrating -- each one of us -- the courage and the hopes that we have, and to feel for a moment this love that surrounds us. To Kellys family, I know you feel only sad and dull right now. I think all of us feel a piece of that, but you more deeply than anybody. But I hope you, too, also feel what love this has unleashed, an uncontrollable love, a love that has no limit; a love that encompasses the reflection of four million grateful people and beyond; the brotherhood and sisterhood of firefighters everywhere; the first responders; and of this city which depends on the courage and -- depended on the courage of Kelly for us to live the lives that we do, Garcetti said. Terrazas said he had addressed Wongs graduating class of firefighters two years earlier, telling them that they were going to become members of a second family. Kelly Wong was a man who loved his family, his friends, and the fire service, Terrazas said. And though he was only with us for a short time frame, he truly loved the Los Angeles Fire Department, and our department truly loved him.Following his remarks, Terrazas presented Wongs service badge to his wife Danielle. Wong, a two-year veteran, was assigned to Fire Station 92 in Rancho Park. He had been scheduled to transfer to Fire Station 9 serving downtown Los Angeles and Skid Row on June 12 and was working at that station at the time of the accident. Wong graduated from the LAFD Recruit Academy on Terminal Island in August 2015 and was the top academic performer in his class. Kellys dream since he was a little boy was to be a firefighter, Terrazas has said. His mother, Ann, shared that story with me that Kelly liked to play with fire trucks growing up. He applied with several departments but he wanted to work for the best. He wanted to work for the Los Angeles Fire Department. And he accomplished his goal. Wong is survived by his wife Danielle; his infant son Colton; his mother Ann; his mother-in-law and father-in-law Barbara and Michael Quinlan; and his sisters-in-law Nicole and Stephanie. A private burial in Orange County was to follow the service. Terrazas said the type of training in which Wong was killed will continue.When Kelly was injured, the crew at Fire Station 9 was training, and I always tell our people that the first thing, the most important thing that we do is respond to emergencies, Terrazas said earlier. The second most important thing we do is train to respond to emergencies. We will continue to train whether it be for a high-rise fire, a brush fire, a medical event, whatever incident type it is, we will continue to train to be ready so we can protect the people of this great city.The LAFD, in conjunction with state safety agencies, is conducting an investigation into the circumstances of Wongs death. Several streets were closed Friday morning in the area to accommodate the procession and service. OCFA Photo",0

Im gonna kill you! she heard someone say from across Orange Grove Drive in Countrywood Apartments. Outside, she saw a man burst in flames. I was thinking, Oh my gosh, how did he just start on fire? she said, standing outside the door of her apartment. It was crazy. The fire stemmed from a domestic dispute at 12401 Orange Grove Drive, unit 114, between an estranged husband and wife, said Larry McKinnon, spokesman for the Hillsborough County Sheriffs Office. According to McKinnon, Matthew Wong, 50, of 31512 Cross Creek Circle in Wesley Chapel, rented a Toyota Corolla that he drove to the apartment home of Gloria Davis. He waited for Davis, 47, to come out to the parking lot and head to work, McKinnon said. She comes out to to go to work, and he chases her with a bleach bottle with gasoline in it, he said. Wong splashes himself while chasing a screaming Davis. Neighbors hear her, and someone allows her to take refuge in their apartment, McKinnon said. When Davis disappears, Wong decides to set the unit on fire where she was hiding, McKinnon said, burning bushes and the entrance of the apartment building. Thats when he set himself on fire, his body wet from the gasoline that he splashed on himself while chasing Davis, McKinnon said. He fell to the ground burning when neighbors came out with a fire extinguisher and blankets, McKinnon said. Wong was taken to Tampa General Hospital, and is listed in critical condition, McKinnon said. Davis was not injured, he said. The couple had been married 25 years, and have been estranged since October. They have two adult children, McKinnon said. Detectives who searched Wongs rental car in the parking lot found black garbage bags taped to the back side windows, and a blanket taped to the back window, McKinnon said. Wong also had a two and a half gallon gas can, gloves and a roll of tape inside the car, McKinnon said. The investigation is ongoing.",0
"NASHVILLE, TN — A Murfreesboro man is facing up to five years in prison after confessing in federal court Friday that he received disability payments from the U.S. Veterans Affairs (VA) Department while working at a full-time job. Edmond Deslatte, 46, a Navy veteran, pleaded guilty to making a false statement to a federal agent in connection with an investigation into his disability benefits, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Middle District of Tennessee. Deslatte received about $148,000 in disability payments under false pretenses, the U.S. Attorneys Office said in a statement. In the plea hearing Friday before U.S. District Court Judge Aleta Trauger, Deslatte admitted that he made a false statement during an April 2011 interview with a special agent with the VAs Office of Inspector General, the federal prosecutors said in the statement. At the time, he was receiving 100% disability benefit payments from the VA, although he had been working full-time. Deslatte said he falsely told the VA agent that a medication prescribed for his medical condition had rendered him disabled and unable to work. He also admitted that he had not been taking the medication, as he had told the agent, the prosecutors said. Deslatte said in court that he misled the agent in an effort to keep receiving disability payments from the VA. But in May 2014, a VA physician determined that Deslatte did not suffer from the medical condition that had supposedly rendered him disabled, and the VA subsequently terminated Deslattes disability payments, the prosecutors said. Along with a possible prison sentence, Deslatte faces a fine of up to $250,000. He is scheduled to be sentenced by Trauger on Jan. 19.",0

"LONG ISLAND CITY, QUEENS -- Cash, loaded guns, and a cherry red Lamborghini are just a few of the goodies police uncovered in a drug bust on four Queens traffickers linked to at least two overdose deaths, prosecutors said. They found the rest - including 22 pounds of narcotics - hours earlier inside the ringleaders Brooklyn drug palace prosecutors said. He and three others accused of supplying dealers with heroin, fentanyl and other drugs were arrested in the bust - the result of a yearlong investigation prompted by the two fatal overdoses. Dionne Slay Sharrow, 35, was arrested in his Long Island City luxury apartment after authorities identified him as the groups alleged ringleader, said Special Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget Brennan. Cops seized a loaded gun and nearly $600,000 from his high-rise on 51st Avenue, along with a Lamborghini parked in the buildings garage. Sharrow is accused of supplying heroin, fentanyl and cocaine to the other three suspects, who in turn allegedly sold the lethal drugs to dealers in Brooklyn and Queens, along with a few in Orange and Ulster counties, according to the charges. The escalating toll of overdose and addiction has become unbearable to all but the drug dealers and traffickers who peddle death in ten dollar bags, Brennan said. As the citys drug-related deaths continue to climb, prosecutors claim the rings drugs - namely heroin and fentanyl - were behind the September 2016 fatal overdose of a 22-year-old Brooklyn man and that of a 42-year-old Kew Gardens man in May 2017. Heroin, unfortunately, has made a deadly comeback in New York City and in the surrounding suburbs, said Queens District Attorney Richard Brown. We are witnessing heroin being mixed with the synthetic drug Fentanyl, which is up to 50 times more potent than heroin alone. Police on Tuesday night raided the drug palace Sharrow allegedly maintained in Bath Beach, Brooklyn, where they found 22 pounds of narcotics stashed in couches, an oven and other hiding spots throughout the apartment, according to the charges. They also recovered thousands of dollars in cash, several pounds of marijuana and supplies to distribute the drugs. Cops arrested Pablo Cito Vallecillo, 39, at the drug house after watching him carry a bag filled with cash into the apartment, prosecutors said. Two others - Antonio Lopez, 40, and Jason Keating, 41 - were arrested in their respective Queens homes. Cops recovered a shotgun, two loaded pistols and hundreds of heroin-filled glassine envelopes from Lopezs place in Howard Beach, according to the charges. Inside Keatings Jamaica residence, they seized thousands of dollars and several pounds of marijuana. The arrests of these defendants undoubtedly saved the lives of many New Yorkers, who might otherwise have overdosed, said NYPD Commissioner James ONeill. All four were arraigned in Manhattan Supreme Court Wednesday on charges including conspiracy and criminal sale of a controlled substance. Lead photo via Shutterstock.",0

The men said that they talked with Wilson at the door, and Wilson repeatedly thanked them for rousing him. VanAtta said that Wilson was burned on his arms, legs and the back of his head and was wheezing from apparent smoke inhalation. He said Thank you about a million times, and also told the neighbors that he was fine, VanAtta said.

"A Valley Stream man that owns a Brooklyn-based medical supply business was arraigned on Wednesday with stealing more than $1 million from Medicaid. According to Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman, Kester Atumonyogo, 49, and his company Monack Medical Supply, Inc. were charged with billing Medicaid and Healthfirst, a Medicaid managed care organization, for an expensive nutritional formula while supplying patients with a lower-priced substitute and stealing over $1 million in the process. New Yorkers pay into Medicaid to meet the healthcare needs of the most vulnerable in our communities, said Schneiderman. They deserve to know their dollars are going to help people, not profit unscrupulous business owners. We will continue to investigate and prosecute those who steal from our Medicaid programs to enrich themselves with taxpayer dollars. According to the indictment, Atumonyogo used a fraudulent social security number to enroll Monack as a Medicaid-participating provider of medical supplies. The company then allegedly filed false claims to Medicaid and Healthfirst that Monack had dispensed to pediatric patients a highly specialized and expensive enteral nutritional formula, which is prescribed by physicians for patients who must obtain nutrients via a feeding tube and cannot metabolize dietary nutrients from food. According to Schneiderman, the investigation revealed that Medicaid and Healthfirst paid Monack for the specialized formula, although Monack only dispensed Pediasure or similar over-the-counter nutritional supplements, and at times administered nothing at all. The Medicaid reimbursement rate for specialized enteral nutritional formula is substantially higher than off-the-shelf or over-the-counter nutritional supplements. In total, Atumonyogo and Monack allegedly stole more than $1 million from the Medicaid program. The investigation also uncovered that Atumonyogo allegedly used two different dates of birth and claimed to have been born in two different countries. Using that false identifying information, Atumonyogo allegedly obtained two different social security numbers that he has used interchangeably since the 1990s. According to prosecutors, he used the second social security number he obtained to enroll Monack in the Medicaid program. Prosecutors also allege that Atumonyogo used a different social security number in 2006 to obtain welfare benefits, and that in October 2012 and September 2013 Atumonyogo filed false income verifications with the New York City Human Resources Administration, claiming that he only made $200 or less per week. The Attorney Generals investigation revealed that between March 1, 2012 and Dec. 31, 2014, Atumonyogo received at least $575,806.88 from Monack. Atumonyogo was charged with first-degree health care fraud, three counts of second-degree grand larceny, third-degree welfare fraud and two counts of first-degree offering a false instrument for filing. If convicted, he could serve up to 25 years in jail. Photo: Shutterstock",0
